       "[\"resolution my name's Bobby does show an injured around we're going to sit down with twenty five masters of the design industry and we're gonna learn from them we're gonna learn how the best companies in the world approach communicate and deployed design in their businesses every single day in this episode we're talking with Katie deal Katie is the director of experience design and Aaron be should focus on how to frame user experiences and you storytelling to lead a discussion  we're gonna get to that stick around right after these messages  thanks for the support whether you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move with squarespace visits where space not calm and into the code high resolution one word for ten percent off your first purchase  thanks for joining us thanks for having me  what's one thing about designed it's clear to you that you feel is not so clear other people in  it's getting better but I would say  some still don't know that design is more than what you see  as Steve Jobs said that  it's not just what it looks like that how it works I'm paraphrasing  and of course I believe in that but there's a little bit more to them  when we think about design were often think about solving problems  design it's simplicity is just being intentional about something trying to solve a problem thinking about the end user hopefully doing so in a maybe a collaborative fashion doing it iterative fashion these are often times the tools of design but you can  use those tools for really solving kind of almost any problem  so it might be and what the interface on the app looks like what color is it hands and where the buttons go and how that works but it can also be the strategy or the shape of the org and how people work together and who works with  these the types of things that you can use that tool set of design to solve for  and I don't know if that's wide enough it's known wide enough  unfortunately but we're getting there for sure what is what is that tool set so that's interesting so it sounds like you're saying that there's this thing that we can use call design for things outside of user faces  we can solve business problems and we can design teams using this process what what are some of the things that you've used in this process yeah and it was very clear while there are people that have job titles that into designer like myself yeah it doesn't necessarily mean that only designers do this right I could just like will not only plumbers plum right or teachers teach at it design is a method for solving problems  as I mentioned it's about bringing intentionality to it and good design I feel includes a humanistic approach try to consider who the end user is and so on word you might be thinking about well who are the people in that organization that are gonna be affected by what the shape of that organization looks like and so you know you bring the tools of research and you get out and you learn from those individuals what they want what they don't want try to understand what might come of these decisions that you might make and then the other part of the tool set is iteration  designers  great designers utilizing  duration and so that might mean that they make a low fidelity version of their their idea other solution first and test it out so that they again can learn from that and user group to know whether or not it's working  basically leaving your assumptions on the table so to speak  and trying to find what that right solution might be another tool in that tool set would be collaboration  great design I believe works with a collaborative team a multi disciplinary team  because you know we don't know every answer and I'm trying to say that design can solve just about any problem well we're not an expert in just about any problem and people using design or not expert and everything so you have to bring people together other experts that you can learn from  in order to develop those solutions  it's interesting how do you  see what's in it  innovation and collaboration one of the things that I in my in my designer past I found to be really interesting is integration once you get the hang of it once you understand that that's a key component of the design process it becomes so obvious that you need to do it because it I think one of the superpowers designers have is that we can just create stuff from the ether and do it a thousand times really quickly right engineers don't have that leisure   but the the kind of flip side of that coin is when you iterate on something that you do it at low fidelity  the business people right like the non designer's the seem to generally not be able to get past the fact that it looks like crap but it needs to look like crap in order in order for it to move forward how like how would you explain the art of iteration and the importance of federation to someone in the business   lower risk fast   okay I know it's there I hear you it can be difficult to show somebody something that is in all the way thought through and you know they start poking at you know well that that copy is wrong or you know that that it's too big for the area that's going to be  and they might have great points but you're you're trying to direct their conversation props to something else keeping it low fidelity  and helping them see the stages of what you're working towards I think one way to solve for that is that you know you show them what I what you can do in terms of the high fidelity version if we'll get to this Polish screen that has all the right bells and whistles but in order to get their first let's make sure we have the idea right  let's make sure we have the interaction model right  or we're talking about it or click let's make sure that you know before we go and move desks around  you know when we're gonna put new signage up and everything but before we do that like let's try to you know scenario plan here what is gonna look like we have people over here a couple of their  in think through some listeners Michael who's gonna come of what meeting right like you give yourself examples of that and but I think yeah that they need to be able to know that you you will get to the end and finalize that  speaking about organizational design you've been here for a few years and Airbnb since then the design side is like re shuffle bit right  terms lay out structure how however you guys work together  and that's a that's a good school to have that sense of adaptability  but how is a remax approach this yeah I mean we're definitely gonna company within hyper growth and so you know I started here almost three years ago and it was about ten people in the experience design team and now it's  close to eighty S.  it's from  of all  how so much has changed but so much has maintained through that  a lot of the good things and and some of the challenges of course to  but I guess how we've approached it is that one starting from what do we want to stay the same and knowing that we're going to grow and in our mission is to help anyone belong anywhere and you know we can't do that unless we scale our mission requires that kind of global scale as but if we're going to do that we're gonna expand our team here and abroad and  make sure that we're expanding our product  we need to figure out what are the things that are principles or values that you just can't change and I think we're pretty lucky that our founders got that from the get go and they prior to its culture a culture it's been a really big thing for Airbnb and I think that's one of the reasons why we've been successful  because we've worked really hard to make sure that everybody that works here is passionate about the mission is you know excited to embrace the adventure of building a business and you know uncertainty and challenge that comes ahead of us and that people are really you know strong in their skills and that I think has helped to make sure that you no matter what we do in a matter where you are in the world you know you're working on some side somebody that you don't mind and banging your head against the wall through late at night trying to figure out a heart problem like you trust the people that we work with that and that's been a big deal  so  when I first joined  as images super small team at the time of what was the right size the time at ten people time at it basically was kind of a design project right is that right about it in a bill this team  I got under  chance of where we're at today we're going to get to so just like great design utilizing research and so I did one on one interviews with people on the team in a one on one interviews with our partners I product and and just try to understand what was working what wasn't working  with them in the designers  of course you know look at the work in India where the process was and how things were going there basically just did a you know an assessment just like you would in any other design project  and then started to kind of shape what the opportunities were like where the problem areas and how might we do these differently and again just like great design be collaborative with it so it's not like we're just gonna in a redesigned the design team without you in colluding the designers and the product managers and the engineers and so we did a lot of workshops and we talked about you know the types of things that we could do to improve it one of the problems we had at the time is there wasn't a real sense of togetherness in the nineteen  and that's because there were ten designers and probably around eleven product teams being that you know if the product teams were focused on different areas of the product right and these designers retention working on islands by themselves in with engineers and product managers but not other designers and they were sitting in all sorts of different places until we identified that is a opportunity area  the other place that we saw some challenge where  the designers were feeling like they were only utilize basically at the end of the design process unit make things look pretty  and staying AT and they fell under utilized the product managers engineers and understand why in the designers and seen that engaged and so there is this is like you know kind of dueling challenge there where and not nobody was happy  it just was working as well so it is it sounds like the  isn't that in designer intensely left out of the decision making process is that there is a  mis education or lack of education around how designers actually should work into a process yeah I mean yeah I there's only so much I can assume as to like how it got there you know but I think it's everybody's at fault right how it got there radius is that you know where the designers actually holding up their end of the bargain right you know where the designer showing that they should be at the table at the earlier stages right where the product managers engineers being inclusive but I mean there's any number of reasons why it might have been that way maybe designers and actually walked away from that or maybe  they once were at the table if you work out I I don't know as much as to what happened before I got here  we certainly try to understand why things were the way they work  but really you know wanted to shift our thinking and how could it be better and a lot of that was about shifting the mindset of the folks that are currently in the building and also part of that was hiring  and so if you looked at the team and thought okay will have the skills we people are really good visual where real people are really good interactions time but we're missing some facilitators were missing the people that you know can come into the room and grabbed the white Ford marker and activate a whole room and that's in one of the places where your designs upfront value really starts to come out rain is that like before there's even an idea they're already providing value in terms of like how the thing is working have a conversation is working and so we started hiring for people like that some people that we know we're going to round up the skill sets the team into only built into the team  in these different individuals people at different in kind of since levels of seniority people with a different mix of skills I had it was starting to become  revealing two engineers type mentors as well as the designers how design can be better leverage it was inspiring for them to see how design could be a part of earlier stages in the process like planning and strategy conversations and just general facilitation of so things are to shift and we continue to build up the team another areas I mentioned that we had folks on islands right so building up the team so that you know we always had at least designers impairs working on things together  we and our design team here we call basically all of the the folks are focused on the design of the product the wine and the U. acts the experiences honors  and that's because there's more than you know the pixels the resigning as the experience  but everybody does a little bit of both you wind you acts but of course there's like different levels right you know that the and there's not a so everyone is eleven eleven am to ten on all fronts  and so on our teams when you know you have a pair you you think about like will this person's really visually strong and this person's little bit much strong interaction so pair them together so that they can help each other  and learn from each other and those that still exist the concept yeah  our teams  now have you know we're we're even pass just having a pair which is great  and so yes we have a few more does that mean  but yeah we we do we work very hard to the the managers and I and where you know people are gonna go and how we balance out skill sets  you know it might just be because I like to drink so much but I kind of think about is like building a good cocktail think about a team of psychiatrists and it's all like all the ingredients on the vodka  have anything like too strong overpowering  I have a balance out interest rate and it's not just like visual interaction thank you also to think about like they're soft skills like you know some folks are a little bit you know better at the you know the conversational part or the presentational part  presentation part odd there's some folks that are a bit more introvert and some have been more extroverted than anything goes as long as you're thinking about the composition and how it comes together there's a great study and I'm not gonna remember the person's name but it's a ten talk but I'll take up later and show you  but this woman did a study about chickens and laying eggs and she basically put all of the like the best chickens together and thought like well let's see if they make you know the most eggs next to this other group that we're not gonna sort amount just do a mix of chickens and lo and behold the like super group of chickens did not do better they basically fought the whole time and like you're on talk to each other Alfa chickens yes that  a heterogeneous group like nice mix of all like skill sets  return chickens here check the goods but they ended up doing better and it's a perfect analogy for a team in terms of like you know making sure you have that right mix you don't want just like he team and to know that the final bill it's also a good  plus one filling inclusivity things yeah the couple couple roles that you mention on your experiencing said you I. N. U. acts make up the experience team and I'm very curious now because  the Airbnb experience of course is bigger than digital you guys have the physical world experience as well do you have the do you guys think of experience as a system or do you think of it in the world of physical experience and digital experiencing concussion so  we do think of it as a system that includes digital and physical as the experience design team does include folks are folks and you I knew acts and also includes the folks that are full and focus on illustration and animation people that are more service design minded  but generally folks are a mixture of these types of things and it's that make sure that comes together at the I guess the thing that isn't necessarily perfectly captured in the job title is that when we are looking for these individuals we're not just looking for somebody who's going to have a portfolio of nothing but pixels and can only speak about the pixels right we're looking for the people that are gonna be able to talk about how those pixels have ramifications in the real world  and can consider those ramifications which you know is really something that you know kind of transcends time and place I mean it can be very challenging things  but that's the crux of whatever it is and the pixels which of course you know our our tools to instigate this experience  they're only in a very small part of an experience someone has an error being bi most of it probably ninety nine percent of it is them in the off line world interacting with strangers people that probably speak a different language on another side of the planet and so it's imperative that we're thinking about those things when we're looking at a pixel  and so something as simple as you know the words that we choose the size the button or the inability to get to the button is going to be impacted by the fact that you know somebody might be on the phone carrying their suitcase get into a locked apartment and it's late at night  and so considering those things is imperative  how we do so it's actually your story  we have John  story board up on the wall that it was it was on the wall for all to see that we actually use it things like this in our design process every day  and thinking about in terms of pictures and in terms of the stories like a comic strip of what is the experience that someone's going through what is the context of their use  and that really does help remind us that it's more than just what we see on you know our screens there and and that's you know one of the many things that we need to do of course researching getting out there ourselves using the product ourselves or other ways to remind us but  yeah it is a lot more than the screen that's really interesting  how do you define a design centric company   design center company is one that  probably doesn't leave well enough alone  and it know that by thinking of people the end users first   in wants and needs change and evolve and to stay ahead of it by you know looking for opportunity and  iterating ends trying new things and exploring with a  want to make it better  I think that's the design center in the do you think Airbnb is that yes  definitely  we're we're lucky that we have  design at the the heart of this company right now two of our founders is okay CIOS is we have three designers the executive team line that that is definitely a wonderful thing and you know I'd say an advantage to having design is part of the company from the get go there  and that's  kind of permeated within our culture and as a pet mention that culture is so important what's not like we're hiring for designers no matter what across the entire board and then what disciplinarian but certainly thinking about you the end user is a part of it at one of our core values as being a host and that is a very design like thing greatest like thinking about you know what who's going to use this how they're gonna interact with it and that should be a part of everything day thinking and and I think we also have a rather ambitious culture  where you know we do want to make a big impact in this world in our mission is to have anyone belong anywhere and that is a big meaty mission right at anyone anywhere right and that's basically shifting the the mindset of a whole lot of this planet  but we're here because we do believe that we can go after that but  we're gonna have to you know take on a lot of heavy and hard work to get there and then I think that's a part of the design scepter part of it  not

support invision is the world's leading product design platform powering the future of digital design through their deep understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One Airbnb and that looks let me tell you three reasons why I use it one poor communication is one of the biggest blockers for talented teams to when you don't get feedback from others early and often you can get lost in the woods and that's just bad for everyone and three without a prototype it can be hard to show others your full vision for design invision solves all of that you can rapidly prototype at the front end of the design process and collaborate across every stage of the project it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers and developers and writers teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when they use and vision sweet a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision after com and use our access code I. N. B. E. dash high resolution for three months free  so if you years ago every be put out of a brand  and it's I mean it's beautiful and we just walked by the low ourselves coming into this room  by anytime you're launching something that big especially when it's a brand when you could not Freeview it to the majority of the world  there could be a lot of fear of whether it's gonna be well received it's gonna fail right  now it did not still life is still  there  but walk us through that that experience of actually designing nothing in preparing a team for such a big launch and for whatever section you guys may receive some great question it's certainly  the biggest project I've ever worked on rebranding a company that you know at that time was in a pretty large I think we're probably about fifteen hundred two thousand people worldwide  people knew about our product all around the world and here we are about to change the face of it  so yeah it was yeah it's scary it's exciting  but it wasn't anything done overnight it wasn't anything done in a vacuum and and I think that helped give us the confidence that it was the right thing to do we're going in the right direction we went through a very long design process  in terms of creating the logo and typography which did happen before I was here  it was I think close to six months of iteration and our host community  for one as well as some guests were a part of that process  and we did get feedback from folks along the way ends when we applied it to the product and sorry bringing the color system the typography system and really just the kind of the essence of the new brands to the product that is well  was probably even more challenging because we're about to move things around on people that I've been using our product for many years and we did that again with you know included parts of our community obviously we couldn't share it with the world yet but we wanted to understand that it wasn't just what we thought was right but that others could identify with it  our product is all about a community in so course it couldn't be done completely in isolation but I do think the learning here is that you know when you're launching something and if it helps if you can do your best to your room  move the restaurant of the surprise  and it's you know try to integrate you know as we talked about earlier with you know a kind of maybe a lower fidelity version or a partial version and try to test aspects of your hypothesis so that when you are launching something that you put all this blood sweat and tears in  the reactions shouldn't be surprising at scale you know you never know what happens of course you have to be ready for that and you know you know you have to know you tried your best and that you can always change you can always enter eight especially in the digital world we're very lucky that we can you know fine tune as time goes in and absorb feedback  but yeah I think it can be hard for a designer to you know kind of put their heart and soul out there through their work and don't feel at risk of well what if people hate it  but you know if you don't try anything you'll you'll never get to a better solution and you know that risk that you take can be minimized  through going through a process of you know including others and  trying it yourself and prototyping and experimenting with whatever you can  so that by the time you get there you'll know with confidence that it's the right direction this is inform decisiveness you've but now it's it's not you can stick your finger in the air and hope that you do the right thing you guys put in all the work up front to make sure that your core community loved it and that when you guys actually went to market it wasn't about capitulating to the masses it was about believing in the decision process  and the design process and of course now two years later what an amazing branded else right what an amazing mark and it's everywhere and it's friendly and it's beautiful I think it's a look that as one of the great rebrands  so congratulations  so earlier you mentioned that Airbnb uses storyboards to document like to use our journey that you're gonna be designing for right but outside of that what are other ways that a baby involves storytelling in its design process  Sir doing is going to one of those examples of using a maybe a lower fidelity way of getting to what that and solution should be  so you can you know kind of dean Brian and demonstrated direction and get people excited and also prototype it to understand whether or not it's the right thing as the story telling can be really at any stage of the product development process the problem solving process I have it's a powerful one because it's something that every individual can kind of identify with and so if we can tell the story of what a person  is going to go through and we help people kind of start to understand a little bit about that person and see what challenges they might have and how this might be better for them they can start to see themselves within that you know they start to imagine you know people they know and experiences they have had  and it really helps to kind of like **** the heart strings and you know get that understanding of what it could be and somewhere that might come in let's say that we have you know a new idea for a new product and we could talk about the list of features of this new products like you're gonna be like one click to such and such actually live with even say like in a conversion is going to go up with such and such and you get a bunch of people in a room back that sounds great version yeah well you know whatever whatever that is version dollars the  and everyone's probably imagining something different than what that's going to be and everyone's probably thinking of what they already know of  and just thinking of us you know it's like very on top of that but let's say in  senator designer who or anyone on the team who's got another idea  for a new feature that's going to be something that no one's ever seen before and you want them to understand that you told the story maybe you you help them understand what the current predicament is all right well we have you know a family of five they want to go away to remind the weekend the mom spends three hours and Airbnb trying to find the right place she needs in a wheel chair for  because she's in a wheelchair or that you know she's got young kids and they have a pet and they're going through all of these trials and tribulations to find the right place now let's imagine that with this new feature that we already know what her needs are because we've seen that from her previous booking she comes in and out right front and center are the places that we know would be the right fit for her and you can show this through mixtures and we can highlight that with the things that this place will have based on her needs and you can talk about how this experience is going to be better for her and really like to help them understand like her name is and and she lives and you know Newark New Jersey and you cultivate this kind of understanding of context that now you know the people in the room are all of a sudden like getting these really kind of like visceral images in their mind about and from Newark and it trials and tribulations of her booking experience and they're trying to understand a little bit about that product idea that you had instead of a list of features you've told in the story of what that thing might look like and behave like you can break it down to features later you can you know scope up engineering work later  but first you know just like any other human would try to understand it in terms of you know what the person is going through on that's what people can really identify with  and so it helps to sell a story and it helps frame the story and it helps so the work framework and helps you actually even execute on it because you can be reminded of those stages that and needs to go through so that you don't leave anything out when you're actually building one of our talk about just dove tailing into storytelling per second   I think one of the most interesting exciting things Airbnb is launched recently strips  super cool  can you think back to maybe look of one of the first conversations you had with Brian or really any anyone on your team or in one of the business  where you told a story  that validated that trips might be a thing that's interesting to explore the can you can you think back to a time where that certainly was a very big part of understanding what trip should be no everybody's been experimenting with things like trips for a long time and as I mentioned that story board is really powerful tool in thinking about trips because when we put it together and this was before I got here that the storyboard first came together it has I think like fifteen frames or something like this and so it's got gas frames like a comic strip and got host frames and when you do that and you look at it you think about where is the Airbnb product a part of this journey you know where is it helping and where is it not you realize that there is probably only in about you know five of the frames there's a quite a bit of it the on off line travel experience where you know you're not using Airbnb product that much  it's you know it's the host it's the place that you're traveling it's what you quit yourself with and you know your friends and etcetera that are actually in providing that  service the experience not Airbnb and it was very revealing to us at that moment is that like you know there's more here there's more we could be doing to help people feel a sense of belonging when they're traveling and so that was one we're just story kind of like a night in this want for us to do more saying  and then trying to you know go to down the path that you're talking about is like well how did it help us actually find the right thing to do and and get everybody excited about that direction I had actually there were a series of stories done one where we're looking at what might be you know a tourist experience today like than the opposite of what we are going for and so we films people that we're having this experience and finding ways that you know it wasn't that great in  finding those moments where you know an individual was you know getting lost in  was area called the tourist spot Fishman's wife of his words and you know the big boss over the goal yeah range and and seeing the things that most tourists to add and then we did another video where you know we gave the best experience the best trip that we could and try to see what that opposite look like ma'am or what that difference look like and found that it was absolutely there is a there there there's a much better trip to be had  where we were considering the individual and considering you know what a local might do  versus just for the Taurus might do that second when your mom comes to visit you know where you taker those the questions we should be asking not like you know where you know the Taurus are going and think about what the little gems that you know in the San Francisco that you know that's what you know we want people to see if we want to give them a sense of belonging and  how many of these stories do you have to tell before you start finding repeatable patterns because I can't imagine it's just the first one right because that's kind of one data point I think the number of stories you tell is dependent on how many scenarios you're trying to bring to light it's actually remarkable that I don't think you need to get you know a hundred different people telling their story in order to get you know that the quantity behind it's actually you know you need you know just usually just a few stories to kind of and plant the seed in people's mind and let them you know remember like Bobby and Jimmy and and and Serra and you know all these individuals just give them one or two unknown latch on to the stories you can back up that sentiment through data in other ways right so like let's start with a story and then you know we can run a survey or you do online analytics to understand like for me it was there that a lot of people that might feel that way but the thing that really takes root in people's minds the images of a check written there might actually don't want too many too many stories and they just kinda they all sort of blend together and they forget  how can a designer who's working at a company who's never done this process before trying to apply because I I can only imagine that there's someone watching this right now is like well this is I'm throwing out mice back and throwing out all the business goals might not the best idea and trying to reframe it as a story to go present to like stakeholders on Monday ran  but that's probably not enough context right so what are the things that they should be looking for it actually present at that meeting in that's a great question I think it's the and you guys are with the people problem and that's the point of the story is just like help them understand as a people problem of understanding that that you know there are people that have this and where you your idea will take root in that world and  context the business case yeah the yeah quantifiable or that they of quantum data that you have behind it is actually useful in its supportive it shouldn't be the lead right when you're in a setting up your paycheck and you really want to kind of ignite  want to participate in this into you know throw money and invest in your start up no hope people understand that this is something that real people are going to deal with and and let them understand it in you know basic terms  something that they might use  Katie this last segment we reached out to our community and we asked them to help us or some questions  we have five questions that are burning for the communities that we're gonna get into these next all right  the first one is how do you explain the role of design the people in your business  in my bed in a minor B. and B. inn Airbnb how do you explain the role of design the people at Airbnb well it's funny you ask because I have to put together a presentation for many this week we have a a big company event with his top of mind yeah okay all employees are coming over and they want to know what experiences line is  I talking to solving problems  just like we started here you know it's not just what something looks like but it's how it works and I have I oftentimes Intel story by giving them an example of where design isn't or where something was poorly designed  because that's usually the most revealing place were like oh yes that that could be better right and it's it's very you know like when good designs there you don't even know right so if you got a sometime show that off the set and but I I I I like people to understand that your design is by no mean  in something that you know only this one team can own  and that's one of the reasons why in the story board is on the wall for all the scene is one of the reasons why we try to be a very collaborative team is so you know we can all be problem solvers  you know we are often the ones that are in the most skilled at leveraging tools that help was quickly visualize  were also the ones that are you constantly exercising that muscle of problem solving in integration and experimentation of but it certainly doesn't mean that something that we're going to go into an island  so I I hope to encourage  inform people that design is very much a problem solving process and and very much when that we want them to participate in house of design or get Airbnb curly or currently structured need design organs for parts it's experience design design operations research and content strategy in these four parts work really closely together  you know we have team meetings together we sit together we work on everything basically start to finish but that's with in the larger product or which is also a multi disciplinary collaborative and so we also set alongside product managers engineers and data scientists and the way that our design team works in terms of in these four parts is that we are basically  integrated distributed among the product teams and we have  various teams like market place or growth and within those teams will have product managers engineers designers do scientists researchers countercharges except for all working together on that problem and so that they can be you know hyper focused on that problem in the goals that they have become experts in that area  but then when you think  but it kind of like laterally we as a design team in it interact and share a lot learnings across because if we just look only at growth we might lose you know some moments in between between the user's journey and so that connection between designers on different teams is really important  and so that's why we we focus also in bringing the design team together as one entity  so their businesses out there with one or two designers hardly a design to  when your the only designer in a company how do you convince the company of the value of design well they they got you if you're the only one so if they know something  it is a good question before it was an error being be I worked at a company called green start and we were essentially an accelerator at first then we were a venture capital firm essentially but what was different about us is that we invested in start ups with designing seemed equity in return and these were early stage startups like really small team sometimes five people you know they might have a an engineer to marketing person CEO and if I thought they were there was a great sign the thing understood designed to some extent  but yeah you know of course a lot of times when they bring in one designer that they're looking for that you know make it look pretty type of thing  and I think one thing that a designer you know it needs to do in order scale of cells and to really have impact is to you know help that team seem more than that see more than just the in pixels but also the process to get there and include them in that  help them understand the value of user research getting out there and talking to people  it's remarkable how  many companies don't do that  get out there and and start story boarding the journey and what are people going through and think about you know what is it working when is it not  before I joined here I almost want to just leave my company and create a story map because it was such a need for start ups to actually think about their journey because a lot of them aren't and if you think about your journey put as maybe a storyboard or a diagram and then you map it like we called happiness Kerr if you draw a line of like when is it going well and when is it bad yeah super revealing right is so you know where those issues might be  and get that whole team around that idea  they can start to understand a little bit more and hopefully we'll see your value but more importantly hopefully they'll they'll start in you know in bad those sentiments of design it and that tool kit that we talked about originally in order to make the company better  so at large how should designers actually the fine  measure and then present designs all from their projects in  I don't know if we've ever talked about it as just design results  probably because we're so kind of hyper focused on being really collaborative team because we think that's where the the best results come from is it through this team is kind of balancing and and leveraging these different disciplines at but design actually works really close with the data scientists team and of course these research team we knew at the start of a of a design project or a a product development project  we're gonna look at and where are we now you know what it what are the challenges today and you know then we start to you know piece together solutions were including data science in that process  and in a lot of times and they're bringing great ideas to the table  in terms the end solution based on you know some of the things that they're seeing and soon different trends that have been happening over time but also there helping us kind of shape how we might ship it irate so engineering data science are really major part of how we're going to go and launch something  it's very rare that we launch something that's just like a wholly new overhaul of a product all at once the reason why is because it's very difficult to learn from is often times what we're doing is taking that you know kind of end result that dream scenario the envision that we've created and breaking it into smaller pieces that we can ship learn from it  it on and then build on and build on and so you know by the end of you know a year or four months we've completely overhauled the work but it's been a step came to that and design tells help us do that and so when we're looking at each individual step in seeing how it's working  those are the moments were assessing whether or not you know it was a success and yeah I don't know if we ever think about it in terms of like with the design of success it's like wolf was a product success and and there's a lot to it more than just the design of course  I think we can finish with this question  is the purpose of design starts to evolve and continues to evolve as it has been for the last decade  what are some roles and methodologies that will continue to emerge over the next five years  what's so exciting I I mean I I don't know but I certainly am seeing a greater and greater need for designers to think outside the pixels  which is ironic because everything is becoming more and more digital and of course and we're getting into virtual reality and and things are becoming three dimensional  but all the more reason that we have to think in a Beyonce those screens in those goggles and various devices as you know machines are coming in there absolutely enormous scenes are coming here and you know they are they are replacing a lot of the things that humans do every day  but that only you know unlocks more opportunity for humans to spend their time in their brain space and one other things circle happiness  for it like one example is in design tools are getting ever more robust and capable and there that they're starting to bring design and engineering closer together and so that we can you know create an prototyping and building make all at the same time which is really exciting  but because of that you know then we you know I have moments in our day that we can think about other things right hopefully it helps us make those things faster and so we can think about you know the challenges of into two individuals they don't speak the same language on the other side of the planet coming together putting side there bias sees and you know they're in a  inability to understand each other's  you know first starting point to actually break down those barriers those are the things that designers could be spending their time so we can be spending our time thinking about you know government organization of policy  companies to be thinking about more inwardly how they might design their company is it supposed to enter just following suit with what was there before  so I'm excited I don't know what the titles will be  those are always have that little fall I I still don't know the time yeah  I think we make it up on a day to day basis  yes yeah but I think we have our work cut out for us and I think we definitely just need you know it was those interviews come first so full circle  design is more than what it looks like and then we need to really think about how things work and think about how we can apply that to things that you know are already being designed to  but things that you are in desperate need of new ways of thinking and not leave them on the floor  well well thank you so much Caitlyn K.

you for joining us again Jerry who speaking to today we're speaking with Scott Belsky Scott is the founder of the hands he's gonna tell us how to maximize our creative output how to use constraints to boost your creativity and the patterns he seen in top design companies I can't wait to watch this episode but stick around right after this partner message we're gonna get to it  thanks a square space for their support whether you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move with squarespace visit squarespace dot com and enter the code high resolution one word for ten percent off your first purchase  thanks for joining us thanks for having me what's one thing about the sign that's clear to you that you don't feel as is clear to other people it's hard to take one thing  I think that a few things become clear to me first of all  design is very much the little things that make a big difference I think that little things tend to be overridden and big corporations and  and sometimes do you prioritize and small new teams and yet some of these little things like whether it's via a static in the  in in in in some part of the user experience our product whether it's a decision to professionally photograph  your apartments where being the whether it's all the little decisions  making a difference I think it's one thing that a lot of monsters and I mean with  say  yeah we'll get to that but they don't prioritize it I think the other thing that  that companies later on forget is that you know well the  well the science of a of scaling  at a business you know is is  is really like the core you know   business type of  yeah  practices  you know the  the the art of scaling a business you know is very much design it's it's it's non skilled things it's interactions with people it's making the experience   actually designed you know in a way that's consistent from start to finish  and that's another thing that's that's that that tends to be forgotten and the last thing I would just say in the Austin for one thing is that on the design is not only something that's customer facing people  build tools deeply influenced by the tools that they use to build tools and so designing your internal systems the tools that you use the business plan and making it more accessible and using principles of design and marketing to help people engage with business strategy is critical to get people lined what are some of these principles of design  I think it's helping people visibly see progress as it's happening rather than just  cutting it out of the plan because it already happened mean you have to feel progress or to make more progress I think a big part of it is merchandising the actual plan that what's action  all next to stuff needs to be merchandise to people and how do you merchandise with design  with great copy with  less is more with  models and not that are translated into graphics and and these are just things that will do and will spend time on for our customers and our marketing campaigns and maybe our boards when it comes to Internazionale it matters a lot and  and not only does it matter to help people get aligned but also help yourself and as an entrepreneur I would always help translate using illustrator in our business plan to something really simple and and graphically  illustrated in a way that helped me also understand it so if you want to have a great founders emissions centric let's go back in your history the last ten or so years have been be hands me a famous for having built a platform to help creatives show their work actually show finish work to the world even wrote a book making ideas happen which inspired me to start I'll start a told you that before we speak respect for the first time and then  your new project which is the journey in between  is also about maximizing rate about maximizing the potential in between in the harder parts of the project to yeah what there's there's a threat here there's a there's a common thread I can pull what is that correct well  as a couple things here first of all when I when I say that in our business and I have always in mission centric and  and what I'm also implying is that I'm also medium agnostic in the sense that it or something I really am passionate about and I feel as a  problem with solving and also is paired with empathy of the people are actually suffering from that problem in this case would be and so was the disorganization of the creative world and if I there is no attribution knowing who did what  the solution to that I thought should be medium agnostic meaning it should be a network high technology tensely a book we also had a conference and is now in its ninth season and you conference and of a series of paper products organization I mean it it sort of seems crazy from an investor perspective for a company to be so court in court all over the place yet in every instance the mission of all these things was the same to organize creative people  looking back on it I think that that was a long game that really could have killed us many times in the short term because when you're spreading your self to then  it introduces rest it splits are the energy of the team in two different places  if you can somehow pull it off you end up having a more holistic brand that is really about a mission rather than a particular medium and so all of your competitors that are medium centric like I'm a technology company or I'm I'm a conference company if they can't compete with you running circles around them with your brand and with the experience of three sixty real experience you delivered to customers so I think there is one thread which is that when I really am committed to solving a problem I try not to be confined by a particular medium and this new product you referred to I'm not I'm currently calling the journey in between is really just an effort to better understand chronicle what great artists crunch print orders or even leaders of the companies do do indoor the middle of their journey the mass  the metal that no one wants to write about that no one wants to talk about press ignores is full of anonymity and self doubt and ambiguity and it's so fascinating to me how some of those journeys fell and others you succeed what's done in the middle that we can learn from them there is definitely a gap between someone's greater potential like their actual output  and it's interesting that you kind of touch on that that like you know that  trop without space between like the idea of actually putting for most things die  well what do this what are some of the things that you seen people do to actually get through that stage  well what you can do is you can't believe that your incredible vision for what you may actually achieve at the end is enough to keep you motivated  I think that's a mess that  you know I I can imagine where we'll be in years from now and that's going to that's what's gonna keep me going  it may get you started in may help you at times but the truth is is that we are all hard wired for short term rewards  I remember one of the quotes shared by friend will send one of our investors and Beyonce in one of our first ninety nine you conferences where he said that the two greatest injections in life for heroin and a weekly salary  six SO hard unplug yourself we are born with this desire for short term rewards from our parents in the form of love and gratification and then we get a check on the tasks in grade school and we had agreed on the course and we get a weekly salary in a potentially a bonus at the end of the year and then suddenly one plug yourself from that when you choose to pursue an independent career as a freelancer or when you  to be an entrepreneur or start a band or anything else it takes years in order to bring to fruition  and you you can't rely and without the short term the words and when you're not getting them the question is what do you do to survive that trough you have to hack yourself you have to hack your own reward system you have to find ways to keep yourself in your team gauged how do you do that all kinds of fun things some of its design putting things around you celebrating milestones the basically made up in one of our things that I like to tell a story about a behance was every time you tighten behance and Google and always said do you mean enhance teaming enhance so we were always a mistake and so one of the things I would tell my team in the early days was eventually if we get enough Beyonce users to make profiles and projects me post enough blog posts and we get enough link tax through all the hustle we're doing to network around the web we will no longer be a mistake Google will think were real and inevitably like a year later suddenly behance came up when you type it in and then I think it was a year after that were beyond C. became popular here in the states  but it was just a little hacks like that make all the difference  you've written quite a bit about this what role do you constraints play in the creative process so I should really start on that answer with the  the question that I would ask a lot of the designers I interviewed when I was really making it is hot would oftentimes go to a very productive prolific designers and I would ask them for their story around their night near Brighton freeze like when did things go horribly wrong and more often than not  the stories would start with a  open brief that they got from particular client where the client said listen  big picture don't even think about budget during the about timeline yet just like big picture and that those routinely were the stories where it was insufferable process to figure out where to go which illustrates the importance of imports of constraints  constraints on earth our inner sense of resourcefulness which is much more important than resources resources on this is  is making use of what's in front of you entering yourself with things around you the constraints whether it's the time minor some idea that someone else shared I just don't think that creatives can operate productively in a vacuum in an empty space with the court the the supposed infinite resources and no noise noise is actually a critical part of our process mistakes and it is something to think about as our  life becomes less friction filled and as the  products and the services that we use to anticipate our every need kind of iron out the friction of of our daily being what is that gonna due to the fact that we know creativity is actually spawned from getting lost were sitting in traffic we're dealing with deadlines are limited resources it's it's an interesting question that kind of goes in the face of everything we think we want the manufacture constraints in your teens when you work with not just designers would really anyone a hundred percent that's the role of the leader of the lower the room one  the roles of the leader is to constantly  reiterated merchandise the constraints and when you don't have logical obvious constraints find them seek them right and and and and  and merchandise that because they help everyone and you can always  maneuver around them you can always there's always an exit plan an exit strategy if something's not working but  it it's it's empowering to the team to have tangible  anchors in the form and and just just so we're not in the abstract for a second with a deadline be a constraint deadline is a constraint a  a  a session on the client's behalf that we consider as a constraint a  you know limitation around the type of content or a direction that seems to can  constraining is obviously you know constraints in itself  these are all ways of making us again tapping into our inner resources on this finding a way around it you know and it's up to the founder or the leader to to the fine line those constraints are important this is not just putting it out there like ten thousand dollars one week merchandising piece it was so important and again we always forget the importance of internal merchandising  what is the idea generation gap it's something that we her you written on the for what what is it and how can a designer know if they're in it  well I do believe that  that  ideas are the culprit in most ideas ever seen the light of day in and that's because  as as creative people we are addicted to the energy and excitement and frankly the high that a company is a new idea it allows us to escape the doldrums of project management is the  it allows us to escape our lives and  and all of our self doubts and all of our daily daily grind   and and and so the new ideas exciting and and the the the first thing we do when we get into one of those doldrums of project management you know one of those periods of time where were suffering as we just try to come up with another idea and I like to say that's why they're more Hafren novels in the world there are novels  so I think it's important to be optimistic about the future but always pessimistic about tasks and never  ever truly satisfied with the progress you're making always kind of question yourself and bring yourself down to like the pragmatic realization that you're not making enough progress you have to just Hassel more  the more pain you know the more potential glory in these are the types of things I think as creative as we have to an entrepreneur is we have to constantly  kindly remind ourselves out of and I think that there is this is strange what some of the most productive artistic thing to ask a little bit in the pain of their process I think X. because they know that that's when it's real  I had to use a trick when I get all lofty with my ideas and try and find cynics are people around me that that tend to shoot them down yeah right I'm a friend befriend them I think that the inclination is to say  I've got amazing idea and I want I want to speak to a kindred spirit okay because I really really want them to love what I what role do skeptics or or send explain this process  is an important question because to your point  creative is like to hire engage people for their teams that are also like them here is that typical okay but I like to have a beer with this person is why creative's higher creatives and becomes this intoxicated orgy of idea generation and nothing ever gets done and so you kind of need this sober monitor or or does need a driver  who is constantly reminding you about the budget in the time line and the constraints  in there they're sort of  the opposite of the dreamers  which are sort of the Debbie downers of the world's the people are constantly saying wait a second  yeah well the dreamers going to bed at night super excited to any new idea and introduced her her his team the next day on the on the country the doers are going to bed at night excited when there's nothing new in the pipeline no new things to interrupt our schedule and take us off track  the healthy productive creative team has an extraordinarily strong immune system that is powered by the doers not the dreamers and if you think about the human body the way we stay healthy is our muse system kills off everything that's new right and only when we get an organ transplant do we need to suppress the immune system and empower the did the dreamers to take hold in introducing new organ something new actually changes who we are and so it a great leader of a productive creative team and I saw this many times in the course of writing making it has happened in the inner  these are these teams I would meet  a great leader is constantly first of all hiring a lot of dealers not to streamers empowering the doers ninety nine percent of the time but then making sure that the chemistry allows the doers to take a backseat and the dreamers to take hold when they're something new a new problem to be solved a new brief to be considered you know that's when you empower the creative so dreamers  as far full  even listening companies like Pinterest remember where we Parker  these really strong brands that people look to has the sign leaders as well right  in your investments like have you seen any pattern some of these companies as far as how they approach and the poor design  well he's one of those companies was either co founded by a designer or  had leaders that  really really value design decisions and talent at the very start other companies none of them outsourced design at any point in time  which is actually interesting because most companies at least in the beginning to outsource design and when you outsource something where you're basically saying is it is definitely not your competitive edge  what you do is you outsource things you just need like tables and that sort of stuff that needs to get done but is not really core to what's going to make you stand out and so I I I look for teams that don't outsource their competitors in an inch which is I. think watch a cool thing to look for as an investor and if I think the design  is a real core part of of what they will be building and how they'll succeed and send out you know that that's that's a starting point   I also think that the  the open  yes to feedback around product and design decisions the value in like Morty Parker you Neil really would put a stamp on anything they would go out that represented the brand of that company  and has he's scaled his business he's had to scale the ability to make sure that everything is consistent on brand on point and design is a huge part of the consistency of the user experience of working park whether it's the shipment of your glasses or the store the you go into the website you deliver you visit  or the  or the emails that you get you know the design is just a constant threat and  and there's internal operations to support that your contracts out to other companies I won't name that I worked at before where you had different departments making different decisions and if your product manager you have no say over what the email looks like that goes to your customers that's a problem  okay so interesting now outsourcing implying that you're maybe using a freelance or an agency of some sort right  you will the platform for freelancers agency designers client site designers all of them the kind of celebrate the work that they do I'm curious if you see freelancers an agency designers and and and and people actually work on the client side as standing in stark contrast to each other yeah and what can we learn from each other while it's in it's a great question because I actually have seen many examples of hiring a create great freelancer and bring them essentially in house as an extended part of a team working directly with you into me that is alas outsourcing and going to an agency where they're basically managing you through an account manager  and they're hiding in some ways their process and they're hiding actually who's doing the work so I've seen many examples where companies would in brace at a particular freelancer for something extremely important is often times as you guys know some of the greatest greatest creative talents in the world don't work for anyone but themselves because they can't  I don't think that that means you're essentially outsourcing it  they actually partner deeply with brands and companies  agencies on the other hand I believe are and maybe some of controversially are any  are a in a vast edge from the past near this is it they're coming from a time when you didn't know who to go to get something done  you didn't have the tools to manage creative talent on their own terms are where they want to work and the idea of working with screen is I guess it you know I'm gonna let someone else do that because I know company and  and they're from a time where design wasn't a competitive advantage and  and I just think and it's and where there was an old boy network of people who would place ads and come up with ideas and execute down  I I think that that time is beyond it behind us I think some of the greatest most innovative agencies today are actually just building rosters of freelancers that they have relationships with on platforms like behance and that many of these companies and then the chase basically just have a outbound sales force slash account management effort to build new business so there were their role in all this now is that they own the relationship yep they're they're building the client relationship and then they are not bringing graves in house because  I know that that's sort of an old thing right there engaging craters on their own terms and they're serving as a conduit which is the step towards eventually then not even existing at all and companies being able to find town directly  build relationships and by the way how great is that for the talent yet the town basically gets paid more the client pays alas because the middle man is cut out essentially end the relation to that Spahn between the creator town in the company or brand yields a better output yeah    are there any roles  responsibilities that you feel designers are not looking to are not building that might be costing them influence and credibility that these companies  well I think that  I think that  with all that we're talking about here all this new opportunity that designers have to work directly with clients and to  really be the competitive advantage of all these different types of businesses across industry is with all that opportunity comes responsibility art what is at risk what is our responsibility it means becoming a better manager in means being able to manage up and influence out a story which is entirely different skills that they don't teach you this stuff in design school right I mean this is  this is stuff you have to learn through on your own  a lot of history experience a lot of its through reading books and understanding and attending conferences and and considering that a big part of your education is not just design skills now it's you know now it's also management skills and and  and and and  in getting yourself on that learning hers so I think that's a big part of it I also think that  being able to make sure you can provide for yourself simple things like asking for more money  knowing what you're worth  holding your clients accountable being able to fire clients when you feel like they are sapping your energy and your soul and  and recognizing that that short term sacrifice will yield long term gain  I think that these are all sorts of parts of that responsibility set that we have to take on  I want to go back for a quick second to back to the agency world because there are tens probably tens of thousands of agency designers listening to this I hope yep  I want to give them a snowball's chance here for a second   or not as I will give them a real chance what are what should agencies other than building  winds of contacting relationships with freelancers best freelancers in the world what else can agencies do to redeem themselves  and not be mired by the legacy of what agencies were I have it's a great question because I work with some amazing agency is  and  and what these agencies can do I think and if their bass is being in the nine drunk participants in the process of bringing an idea to fruition odd bringing a different perspective for companies that are not thinking enough about brand because it's not in the DNA of their founders or enough about design  they're great agencies become a thought partner and have a seat at the table the agencies that I've worked with that I recommend and  and we and want to work with again  again insisted on having a seat at the table  dot the actual talent into the process rather than trying to almost keep the town secret and present the know the business contact as the the person that you should interact with   the best agency that I work with are willing to give attribution to the people who actually did the work because they are confident enough that they're adding enough value into the equation with the ideas and with that process improvements that day  they're not they're not afraid of admitting that someone's doing the work just seems crazy but is actually you know to common place  so  and and and really you're also in bass your greeting agencies are willing to work with a brand that's a little off and  you know I think of agencies like red antler in New York that takes a group of  guys like the founders of Casper you know the mattress company and says you know this is all gonna be about your brand and does is a long term partnership to bring the castle Grande the life and to so many people  which I don't think would have happened without written or someone I know there a lot of examples like that so that's the modern age agency I think it's oftentimes agency founded by creative talents and  and really run  in a way that  you know is is thinking about the modern day Klein needs yeah you spoke about one of the skills of designers need to   develop is managing and  I'm assuming presenting as well right  so senior designer at a company and you're about to present a projects to the CEO or non designer executive right   how should that designers start the discussion yeah  what are the things that they should actually focus on in that discussion and how do they actually keep the person's attention which I see is probably one of the biggest issues  listen a mock up is greater than has more power than hours of discussion and debate and I've been in so many meetings where there's just this debate and back and forth and memos being rad and distributed and everything else and then someone just as let's just look at them and if the designers in the room great if they're not like shame on you bring them in and show some mock ups and suddenly within minutes everyone's aligned  as to what should be done next  designers it assert themselves to make that happen more quickly sadly still to this day it's either the product manager or the business unit leader or the CEO or you know someone else who has to advocate for the designer to have a voice in that conversation and has to make it so that the mock ups and up leading rather than following us designers you take that's part of the responsibility you know taking responsibility of making sure that design leads you know the structure in companies  either gets in the way of the S. R. supports it I've always insisted on having designers report directly to me I remember when I took over as VP of product related OB or there is actually a design firm basically in the company like a union if it's like a separate division if you will  I insisted on having a series of designers report to me on the things that I was leading it was very controversial and rightly so because designers who were amazing amazing town designers and company were saying  you know why you know why are there now designers embedded in products and business like what does that mean for us as it's like X. internal agency  I think you have to position designers out to have the influence to be able to assert themselves and to lead the discussion when you're trying to solve something as a business so there's a lot of structural work that needs to be done to make this happen you more broadly throughout business and and and and other industries  thing business so  but designers play a critical role and I pass should should push for that and and in this example where you ask for design report directly to you how were they structure beforehand like where they reporting to anyone like we'll do that look like designers reported up into and this is many companies right and most even start up companies there is a person who leads design designers report up to him or her in there our product managers and people running the business units and designers are then stopped on these projects but there are there are there  compensation in their performance is actually still review it and determine by the person leads design and so that's like a break right there like what what do you mean like the designers so critical to the business in the product yet isn't able to be compensated by the person who's running the business or the product doesn't make any sense and then like why would they feel like they can have their one on ones and get management advice and be able to assert themselves if they're working alongside people but not people that they actually work for our west and so it's on it's just a it's a bit not some cult cultures in chemistry is can still overcome this with the relationships why not structure it to succeed in the first place so I those are the types of things have to think about the incoming got  and coming back to this meeting this presentation Brian  I seen examples where the designer gets to lead this meeting and they go they present they've not even percent they just put a mock right and then everyone just jumps on that mock what ends up happening is the feedback or the discussions that happened is not actually relevant at all to the discussion right I'm so what context to the designer be providing when they put that thing up on the screen to drive the converse is an art is so important it's a great question it starts with  asking you have to look we have to lead the conversation you don't just put up a mock and and then sit back and let the firing squad begin right he put up a mocking you say this is a concept  what questions do you have and and this is the problem that you asked us to solve like the reason this mark exist is to solve the problem following problems  now start peppering the questions and then you help people understand it and  and then when people start to say things like make the logo bigger you know maybe make this blue or me a great designer asks the people to then rephrase it eyes problems they think still exist  I I actually am worried that people are not going to know how to buy   why do you say that it's not clear to me like how you actually go where's the action in or what's the defaults and I want to make sure that ninety percent of people actually do acts those are the types of responses that's the feedback you should be getting not design direction you should be getting problems that still exists because designers roles to solve problems and if your audience still has its problems you haven't succeeded yet   I want to first of all Paula Jones to our listeners of yours about all the noise there  not a single corner of New York where you don't hear some source read noise and it's

understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One Netflix and every day I work with remote teams all the time and I found that keeping a healthy dialogue is really important without it building strong work relationships gets a lot harder and that leads the poor collaboration  I've also found the prototypes

everyone on board visit envision out dot com slash high resolution for three months free  do you have any mentors  do you have mentors  I have I feel like I have rather than one key mentor I have different mentors for different things  and these are people who have gone back to at certain times or help me at pivotal moments  and  I think it's dangerous to have one person you feel you want to look up to emulate because you don't want to play someone else's playbook yeah at the same time  I have made a mistake of insulating myself too much  and  as an introvert screaming nature and I always felt like well it's my own journey and no one else can you help me and and at times I've been humbled by the fact that as soon as I forced myself to ask somebody like what you would you do I just totally realize that I was reinventing the wheel or that there's a logical answer so I push myself to go and visit these mentors occasionally and  and sometimes I'm finding especially these days is not a particular answer all gatt it's more just the conversation is some of the best discussions don't have an answer they're just  aware unwinding thought     interpret yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't have the cash at Scott Belsky okay  at one point it is a no I will point you to the right  there's quite a bit there's there's an intimidation factor right you look up to someone and you want to find them you want to seek them you don't impose too much for you yeah you want to ask them for help  what's the right way to go about finding a mentor and then I'd like to I'd like to talk a little bit about  how do you keep that relationship kindled is important to remind yourself that  everyone super busy and has preoccupations and  you know someone that seems like they've made it and they would be a great mentor probably has a whole other suite of things that they're not worried about it up at night thinking about and whatever else and  and so  you may mentorship comes out of relationships so when you just reach out to someone and say I want to coffee it's you know it's basically saying I want you to blindly give me your time and  and it's I don't know like I always am torn about it because no one had I I like giving back but I also  how much time do I actually have and I also feel like my responsibilities use my time towards the things I can make the most impact and and often times those are talking a larger groups are working on projects that I think need to see the light of day and  I'm not telling my day up with copies of people I don't know Sir I'm I'm toward you know it's a it's a good question I think that  it starts with making it both ways  actually one of my  one of my kind of mentors so I was recently that  visit went to visit he was saying to me that is  I was thanking him for his time and he was like no no no like this is exactly what I'm going through to a different level of my life and so there was this parallel that I felt in some ways he was saying this is why I'm giving you the time because actually I'm going yeah I needed to as what he was telling me and so it's great to find people like that and  and there have been people that have reached out to me you know that I've sort of sad you know I'm going through a career transition right now  debating this you know investor verses operator versus founder versus CEO and and I'm thinking  like I actually think about that as well like I'm always I'm kind of tearing there as well and I want a conversation around that so  so I think you want like all relationships to be especially in business to be mutually beneficial  I think you want to post that  and also just asking a question like someone someone will ask me center in an email and I don't even know the person but they'll pose like a specific question like two or three sentences of where they're at right now at a specific question  just answered it so not a formalized mentor me asking for an hour of my time with their scenic listen like if you were deciding between this challenges this job like Scott what would you what kind of questions would you be thinking about and I'll say like this is what I would be doing if it's helpful great took me five minutes in a in a in a taxi or you know do you think they're more examples  of when someone who thinks they need a mentor is really just needing to do this just ask a question  you know I think that  I think that I think they just getting a question asking a question in getting their data points is governed by  I also have to say that a lot of the best lessons are learned the hard way and I do think that we get paralyzed too often by thinking we need someone else's advice or help when in truth we just need to do the work and we just need to try  we just need to throw ourselves into something and recognize that somehow some way a labor of love always pays off just not how you expect in I I I'm I'm amazed by how true that is I've seen so many people take jobs because they paid five or ten thousand dollars more or jobs because they said well I need to do this for a few years in order to do this later on and then they get stock they become middle managers or unhappy right and then the opportunity costs just gets higher overtime is switching in trying something new  I have never seen a situation where someone who was doing something because they truly love it ended up just like totally as a failure  it just always leads to something and they may start in doing something and they may make no money for awhile but they just like sort of end up somewhere else or having a chance circumstantial conversation with someone else that then leads into another great role something always kind of pans out it's as weird kind of nature of humanity and evolution I guess is that you just if you keep on this path towards  no warmer warmer warmer warmer  you get somewhere in so that means that stock sort of China planning getting more advice before making a decision just make an incremental step toward something that's interesting to you and it will pan out do you believe in building on your strengths or  were trying to make yourself hold by focusing on areas that you need more help on  yeah  well here's a way out answers to this question is that  what we're all trying to do in our careers as freelancers entrepreneurs are leaders of the company is is survived the massing middle of big bold projects and the messy middle to me is just two things it's interns and optimization it's this involves Heil kind of way operate in and  is definitely not linear right it's always you have this great idea  should this is really hard to execute okay like I'm in a progress was not linear it's actually very ball tile full of these downs these lows which you have to indoor and these highs would you have to optimize and the highs are when something for some reason works and it could be in the way your bring people on your team your optimize your team that could be the way your optimizing your only working and more often than not it's the way your product is working or not working  so tense your question I think it's all about optimizing the little things that seem to be working which are your strengths sometimes they're just circumstantial things that happen to work that surprise you  or little things are getting traction your designer and you throw up all the stuff in your personal you know never cares and suddenly one projects goes viral you know and you're like oh I should be doing more of this class of this I really think that dots how greatness in a becomes even greater is when you start to optimize and emphasize the things that people are paying attention to in that are working and naturally de emphasize that things that aren't I don't think it's about obsessing over fixing things that are broken which is country to live  that you should always fix things that are broken don't fix things that are that are broken  so insurance in those lows in optimizing the things that work in both how you work as well as how your product is performing  you want to give a talk about the importance of deciding what you're willing to be bad at yeah when you're working on a product right first can you just explain that philosophy and second do you think this is a tool that designers can use to help focus their career  well what I mean by deciding what you're willing to be bad at is facing first of all the fact that if you try to be good at everything you're not gonna be good at any one thing  better than everyone else right and  and and that's how in individual or brand really stands out as a competitive advantage in an industry which is also we were all grappling towards we all want a competitive advantage in something whether it's to ponder fear illustration or infographics or whether it's you know being the best airline or being the best whatever and so in the process of doing that  when you need to look at is the kind of factors that distinguish you in your industry  our day is it your chief  raise the price is it availability like you're the one that's always just available in people call you when they need someone last minute is it your especially good infographics and you're like just so good at design that kind of comes from math is it that you're like such a good concept artist or that you're like so clever you always finally little thing you put in that everyone kind of and you know kind of engages with on a personal level  find your  thanks but were you shouldn't be trying to do is be the cheapest and the most available and the bass it doesn't doesn't that doesn't that and so when you look at that  X. access right here like okay I want to be I don't want to be known for price I'm gonna be expensive and that's just the way I feel I'm gonna be right  not competing on ninety nine designs or something like that like I want I'm going for quality  and  you know and I don't want to be known for  maybe I don't want to be known photography work  I want to be known for these you know these quick illustration type of work that can be done quickly or whatever it is for you and then when you make a decision that affects everything it affects how you market yourself effects the takes a project to say yes to and no two and you start to have like the standards that you project your portfolio through the contents you right through what you stand for use half to find those things to distinguish you  and I think that's so important and it's easy to say but it's hard to do because when we're in the thick of it in our careers are in leading our businesses were liable to just take every opportunity we can get reliable to say yes for good everything we're trying to be the best  price and availability and this and that in in truth we really standing out  through is is finding out what you're really bad at and are you are you deciding this at the beginning of your career like you know the the thing that many designers it's hot when I come out of design school or even just college or high school really  is to try everything figure out you know what you do like in and focus your attention on the things that you do like or is this a self assessment it you're doing from day one I don't think you should decide right to be  your career is if the figure it out need to figure out what your strengths are what you're being known for its kind of back to that optimizing questions like what's working where people are Peter  my client saying I love working with you because you're always available to the last minute things where people are saying to you that cover you made for us is just like is winning awards for that story and like all my gosh you're so good at these you know taking like almost like a a moment in time and capturing it visually or were they saying to you these Long Beach projects like creating a new typeface or something like that I just love working with you in that capacity in your student did the rigor you haven't seen gaze of the project for years amazing like you hear that in the beginning of your career and as your career progresses but then you have to decide what am I going to be known for if you don't stop and make that decision you will never be known for anything  I have a question around the design community landscape  years ago when you started the hands you know you were solving a problem for the design community and that problem was attribution and  a place to be discovered yeah right  since then to design landscape has changed a lot right there are a lot of things that remain the same but they're a lot of new things that did not exist by ten years ago right some really curious if you were to start be hands again today  what would that look like like what would you be trying to solve a would you be going after  was it the big the big holy grail problem that I always wanted to solve with behance  but did indeed have and we haven't yet as  you know as a senator Hansteen family is  is around a better way of matching  talent with opportunity that on  that sort of transcends traditional circumstantial ways that people get matched up  I don't think the answer is certain certain certainly the answer is not crowd sourcing I think that that hurts more than helps  I don't think that these commoditizing market places for design are good  I think that actually there's pricing power for the designer when here she is match with the perfect opportunity but how do you make it clear that that's the perfect person for you as a brand to work with how do you match the two of you and how do you make sure that great content personal rises to the top is not always the same usual suspects in our training at the top of a search  and then  and then how do you make to people work together in a superior way over time  with with high you know with a high price point and I think the dots there's so many like  docks  desk type of work you know whatever things in the world that help people matching it but it's still all about like price and availability and it's not about is high quality creative relationship between the client and a brand  so that's the problem that I find still very interesting and I think it still is B. had a head of the hands and adobe potentially or other companies out there so no we're we're running short on time you have to leave soon we've got a couple of communications that we want to get to church   and these could be rapid fire let  how should designers explain the role of designed to people in their business  I think the designers should always  round design as the  as the discipline of problem solving right and   so it's E. as well as again those little things that make a big difference I think that it's also important for designers to help their clients internally or externally right I understand that  that their solutions are are coming from years and years of experience and exposure and portfolios they looked at and critique and everything on my favorite stories about the whole kind of Paul rand Steve Jobs relationship was when they negotiated on the rate for so long and then like right and just sort of immediately scribbles this thing give Steve this thing and he's like what are you kidding me I continue this like six figure sum for like two minutes of working as a note for like thirty years of work and it's so but as part of the education Herve designers have to  do their clients of the murders and where the solutions even coming from so making sure that your discipline is regarded as one of problem solving making sure that clients understand sometimes the little things actually make the biggest difference helping your clients understand that it's an end and experience that's been design is not just the splash page or some part of the product those are things that you need to push  the second question one you're the only designer at a company out of business  what are the things that you can do to convince leadership of its value  well I think that showing not telling me a speaks volumes right  when  better and there's also the aspect as  H. as in much has happened when you show something that  holds the argument and suddenly brings it to another level  sometimes you can actually  it is a mock up into a today and actually expedite the decision and help get people lineman for quickly and no one even knows that it was the design in the designer that that succession be attributed to and so it's important as a designer that circumstance to you to bring that  to the leaders attention and this is why you know just taking a step back I feel very lucky to have had this design background from college and took all these design classes anyone in the business and then I built this new design community and really jumped into being a product designer basically with my team and also had about her leadership development to some always kind of is is a weird mix and the thing I am always taking out of it is that designers are not  considering themselves leaders in a team or not being powered as leaders in teams and the companies that I actually believe that design is competitive manage  and empower designers to have that see the table and lead  Andy structured internally incumbents in internal in the right way  are the ones that you know how that can happen there is come through the market place so we can and with this last question has the function of design continues to of all what are some roles and methodologies that you think will emerge over the next five years  well I think that the  I think that design is starting to become a competitive edge on the enterprise tool side of things  I think that  it's been such a consumer product focus and actually it's funny in the investor landscape people still consider themselves either consumer product investor or an enterprise rocking Vester in  you know what  it in a day their people using the products and when you're making the investment you need the same lands around the product sensibility and how the team is structured our designers and power to make a difference in all these different things sure the business model and go to market may be different  in the pricing things like that but it but the products themselves need to be borne by the same principles and how do you get designers all jazzed up to work in a company that does enterprise tools in it was another challenge but I think that  but I think maybe it's gonna make a difference if they were to see more of that I think that the the interface is the place where a lot of industries are finally becoming competitive in being determined in terms of who wins and sort of like that slapping hands game we're in a great product is building an interface for the technology that they built and then another product is building interface that just basically uses the API is about product and then another product is like an audible version of the no visual or at or at audio you I and it and it's like it's an interface game but guess what that's all designers right designers only interface in the future is going to be determined by interfaces by screens in our homes by audible cues by you know all these sort of a I supported  frictionless interfaces it's exciting it's an exciting time to be a designer and to be thinking about industries and problems that just need to be rethought  the request and

       " \"lower on the page it's been around since the two thousand one gas on the page has been around since two thousand one  it I have a a writer studio in Los Angeles where I teach live classes and I teach them on first draft rewrite page TV  some story analysis you know just whatever I think that our writer needs  in the moment and also have a podcast calls on the page  we've been doing it for I don't know seven or eight years weekly podcast with writers and producers anybody who can talk script  how did you get into doing this how do I get into doing this  was kind of a a sideways move a friend had asked me to read a script for her  for a company she was working at I found out you can get paid for doing that huh and I ended up sending my samples  to Amblin entertainment at the time which was  Steven Spielberg's company and I got hired as a reader and I kind of learned on the job  reading not only for Amblin but also DreamWorks and they became DreamWorks and a number of other companies and then I ended up teaching based on what I was learning from reading scripts as and seeing how people were responding to them what was working what wasn't working I try to translate those into tools and those classes became popular became a book stuff like that  we're here at story expo two thousand fifteen we're getting you in between classes and so forgive me if I'm a little rushed here I just wanted to find you or  take on this right now I'm reading  Joyce Carol Oates book the faith of a writer which is  sort of about her life and she talks about  the  writer sort of isolation and some of the things that are a little bit darker that some of these books don't always cover one thing she says is the artist is born damned and struggles through his or her life to achieve an ever elusive redemption by way of their art wow wow I thought is lighter than we are that the artist is born damned is very interesting to me because I think that some people can feel that they've been damaged by creativity that there is this need to express something and they're sort of in a personal jail until they can get it out and I think that that might be what she's going for there is to talk about this fact that it's not that an artist  create because they want to make money they create because they have to and  and and as far as that personal redemption I think it's more that idea of sort of a a personal release but I think she certainly on to something everybody's a little damned and they're better people for it  first thing like that should a screenwriter have a plan be shot a screenwriter have a plan be high I guess look on a practical level I guess every artist should have a way that they can make money but not as the the that that plan that says well I'm gonna give up eventually and then I should do this I think there it's fine to have a job that you love that supports the art that you love and I think what you'll find two is that they often go hand in hand you know you can bring your writing to a day job and you can bring the experiences from your life and day job and family into your writing so it it these things don't have to compete  what makes a good story for me I'm always saying it's action plus a motion  because the kind of story telling that I teach a scripted store storytelling so we have to see it and we have to feel it action be get some motion which begets more action so to me it's the marriage of these two things  what do you see writer struggling the most when they come into your classes what is some of the things they share with you when they struggle the most is probably this need to to follow rules and get it right and there are no real rules and there is no one way to get it right so I'm always trying to get them just to express their intention for the story in pages as best they can if they've met that intention that's right you know those are their roles so I I think that's that's that's where I see you artist struggling as you know it's it's got to be perfect no it doesn't it just has to be what you want  interesting now that  what can a screenwriter due to get better at their craft is that is that basically it to just kind of express that underlying motion without trying to be so perfect in explaining a certain store that if they were a little more free with it yeah yeah I do think that there are  no on the other hand  certain  tools and techniques that they can use for  for  tearing down their work for focusing their work for making sure that their meeting their intentions by picking the words that best expressed that by placing the words where they need to buy really focusing their scenes so that their scenes tell  story  so it's not a question of  just be free okay it is a question of really looking at your art and making sure that you are telling the story as best you can  with those intentions and mine   I've say don't meet make it perfect because it doesn't have to be but you do have to spend some time focusing doesn't make sense it does it does is there a point that a writer should give up on a screen play is there a point that a writer should give up on a screen play  I you know no I don't think so because I think you've all heard the stories of I and then I put in and shore and then six years later somebody wanted this or a world event happened and it was just right so you might put it aside for the moment because it's not getting the traction you want it's it's it's for you yourself have tired of it and you want to move on to something else go ahead put it in the drawer but don't get rid of that that is a piece of art that will find its way eventually  do you believe a screen writer should write their first draft as quickly as possible just kind of burger to take it out of themselves and then  revise from there not you're talking about the vomit draft our two  we have such nice expressions for it I yes I do  and why I urge my students not to look back that's where the perfection starts to come in and they stop of the writing process and they have these beautiful for first acts and then they never go any further so yes by all means right to the end  and then you can go back in and you can start honing it and chiseling away at it or fattening it up make it better but right to the end so they plan to do a ninety page script don't don't stop in the middle and make sure that it's okay they've got to just get it all out right right barrel forward I think I think so many people make the mistake of going back and re reading what they wrote the day before polishing that up and only moving this much further we don't have enough time you know we only set so much writing time in the day you've got to make as much use of that as you can press for is there a time frame for writing this for script  I think that time frame is is personal it really depends on where you fit it in your life you know  I've made my whole philosophy of teaching is writing in ten minute increments because of being a busy person myself and knowing that my writers are busy so I do believe that what ever time you have you can make the best use of it as long as you focus  does the screen play began with the word fade in doesn't doesn't begin with the word faded into me like should you have faded or not have the bay  well does writing began with the word fade in or because someone actually begin part of it in the middle I have an idea for a crux of what I want to happen but I don't have the book ending I don't have the the finished part and have the beginning yeah I think you can jump around sure if if you have certain scenes inside of you that you see visually that are sort of the tent poles for the story by all means write those down and then write what  works up to it and what springs off of them but if you get to a certain place where you're only writing what you love you're being a little and disciplined you know at at that point you have to go all right I have to start writing the scenes that I don't know or don't love as well then start from the beginning and start moving toward those key scenes that you've already written  do you think a lot of writers are undisciplined seems like writers of any of the of all the arts it seems like writers of the most sort of discipline the most heart of themselves the most sort of reigned in policy I I don't find it there and this plan but I I do think that we all have little chip tricks that we play where we write only things that we love you know or or or that we're good at you know I've watched a lot of writers that will write scene after scene and I'm like yeah I know you can do this okay where's that scene that's really hard Frio right that so it's not a question of not being disciplined so much as you know not wanting to be taken to task for not not being wonderful  right away  for time wasting with writers aside from surfing the internet and research yeah what do you see as some of the stumbling blocks to time management  stuff I well I think you just name to two of them you know surfing the internet and research right research is the most creative form of procrastination where somebody has no wait I have to stop I really have to look that up my  my usual advice is not right what you want and then find the research that supports that story point instead of the other way around  but  yeah I think that that is the the the place that we all tend to convince ourselves that we're actually working and we're not we're serving  but the screen writers that you know who have sold screenplays how much of that work is better than some of those who've just put it in a drawer they finished it they've done ten drops but they're just not willing to like either take what they need to do to go on pitch it or no one's really looked at it and said this is the one well you know it you're you're heading on on both things that cell the cell one is he talked about pitching right and and there are some people I've seen who do react very well and their careers not necessarily just sell something so much as get a career off of the script that they wrote and I've seen and and that's one breed of writer that can just make connections with people you know convince them first to read the thing which is hard to do there's that kind of writer that does very well but then there's this other kind of writer that does very well because you have to pass the script a lot they have written something with such a specific voice and commitment to the characters or an idea or two a tone that it makes everybody want to pass the script along so it's those two things either being really good at sort of getting your stuff out there and getting in from the right eyes or being exceptional on the page one of those two things will get you the career that you want charisma versus crafter no it's not just Christmas the person the person who is Chris Matt craft that's the person  and I've seen a couple of those and that's a guaranteed success  the the people who do well can have just one charisma or craft it would be nice if they had they had all  best questions a screenwriter cast themselves to develop a better story right up front is what is the story what is the movie story or what is the TV story that's where the log line comes in that everybody so happy to talk about but it really is a one sentence expression of your intention if you can't get that down you might want to go back in and and and really we examine you know is there something to write here so first of all ask yourself what is that one sentence expression once you have that then you wanna ask yourself you know what what turns you on about that idea okay based on what excites you about that idea now ask what are the scenes that express that excitement you know that really really show those beats that are that you have to show on screen you know and then keep working backwards from there Kay who are the people that populate that scene what do they say so if you start big picture and then you keep sort of breaking it down to the things that excite you the people in it what they say I think I think those are the questions to ask you as you're writing  how should the screenwriter spend their time let's say for ten hours that they dedicate to their career how many of those ten hour should be developing an idea actually writing the screenplay watching movies which again could going to research  art networking reading it cetera I think we've spent our life watching and that we should continue to do so but that's not really homework it's just what we doing what we love now we don't have to feel guilty about it you know great okay terrific so you're doing that anyway  as far as networking goes it is the the question of keeping your eyes open shaking hands making friends  capitalizing on relationships that that's also that can also happen at the same time that this is all sort of multi platform stuff that you're doing anyway so when it comes to the real time spent for writing right now  you can't really count any of those things as well I was writing because I was watching TV and I was making a friend  get right  is that was set to go to any calls the work to the work that scares us cyclist that that's that's sounds sounds right to me cried   what what is the work that you see scare most people that come into your classes that I you know I think it's it's the work the scares people it depends but often I see it in sort of the rewrite process where you have spit out that first draft where you have written the scenes that you love and then there's this you know a problem area that you have to tackle and its first about figuring out how to fix it that's that's hard but even when you know how to fix it sometimes it's not what you want to do and it's but you have to that is the place where it's hardest thing but once you get passed through at the past past bad through that  I think that it's probably the most rewarding because you really did the hard work  he'll just focusing back on Joyce Carol Oates book the faith of a writer has a chapter on failure I think she touches briefly that a lot of artists are attracted to failure hand do you have an opinion on that I don't know I'm not really good at you know figuring out the psyche of art is  it when you're my class you know I'm I'm always like leave the drum on the page you know I want to hear about it let's get writing you know that's sort of how how I work and I always feel like sort of the the writing pushes through the issues  or you can take those issues and give them to a character this can be really cathartic for you  but  as as far as people being attracted to failure maybe one kind of writer is I don't know if all writers are I think some people are just attracted to storytelling  when it comes to selling a screen play what are some of the mistakes that you see a lot of screen writers make the mistakes would be  desperation  insistence you know where it's you don't know you have to read this  it might the only story and you know the the more persistent and desperate you are the more people back off mean think of it is if you were dating you know no you have to go out with me and this is why you know that's charming right so it's when I see people do that  immediately you know they they just they just sort of ruined at  the people that let allow the breathing room in their relationship and let the words make somebody come to them that's where they'll deals happened sales happen but again remember this is may  me about getting your career going this might be where you're hired you're not always going to sell a screenplay that screen play is going to sell you was like that's where charisma and comes back into place so how does that work and I'm sure in LA it's slightly different than in other parts of the country but how do people develop that charisma whether or not too pushy but at the same time not to make you know I I may have expressed a wrong would talk about Christmas was talking about with  the people who make it I see like some some writers are very good about getting their stuff out in the world that still has to be a good product that they're getting out and some people are just very good at the page but they still have to be decent enough in a room that they don't scare people off it really is a mixture of both those things but the kind of Christmas we're talking about doesn't have to be like you know big bold shiny Christmas which is talking about sort of  an authentic connection I know that with authenticity is used a lot  there's something to that you know the idea that you feel like you're talking a real person who has a story that they want to tell who you know it's it's there and it it X. the the  possibilities of it are exciting and that the writer has made those possibilities evident to the listener like this is what I'm trying to get out there isn't that interesting  yeah it's interesting to me to  calibrated way I heard the phrase used the other day a walking hidden agenda and I think that sometimes that's what we're trying to push our stuff out there we can come across like that we don't mean to me just a more very excited about something so I know that's a very nice  if sort term but it's actually very like a lot of people shy away from it no way because everybody does have something here they're pitching and assault hidden agenda but how can someone sort of like be excited about it but not be too aggressive in if they're working a room with some passion passion okay give it think of instead of like I am in need it's I have a passion for what you know and I think that that would that would work excellent a walking hidden agenda that sounds like a really good character description for like like a antagonize us uses a walking hidden agenda  yeah I know I heard it I just lit up like wow  developing a character we keep hearing about that there's classes on that what does this mean and how can someone develop a character whether it's someone that's a walking in and Jenna or yeah well developed character I've got a couple of tools that I use in class one of them has to do with  developing a skill K. when you watch a character actually develop a skill whether it's a physical skill of fighting or whether it's an emotional scale of learning how to connect with somebody you're watching that character develops and you're watching it AT and experiences happening in front of us a scene is happening and event is happening we can see the development so that's one way to develop the character what skill physically or emotionally are they developing another way to develop the characters to think what are their ongoing patterns are rules that we always see them do and they do they break that rule when they break that rule where they've shied away from their patterns they're developing  \",\n",
       " \"hi rob grant and I am Gary Martin from RG ET you dot com today were sitting down to talk with Sandra about his life and his career  just terrific and really wonderful opportunity for us we appreciate it why you're so very welcome and very very pleased to be here  let's kind of begin at the beginning do you want to talk a little bit about how you get into photography like where you grew up what were your influences were sure sure  well I'm a native of Elgin Illinois and  I remember it was sixteen years old and I picked up by an American photo magazine and flipping through the page number lane and I've done my role in you know flipping through these pages and again I never heard of the photographer Irving Penn because this is all new to me and ran across a couple of images that Irving had taken one of Pablo Picasso and another one of this French theatre actress  collect her name and how many pages in in in  the stark  incredibly sexy dramatic black and white portraits of these people in Hannah something happened to me I would I would just like who are these people  you know how did Irving capture these these images I want to know more about this subject because of the way that pan had photographed them something went off on me that day you know  you know and I really had no idea in life really what I wanted to be yeah you know we said like a Grand Prix race car driver that is not happening  but you know Alston this interest came in to me about you know photography and I wanted to know more and I want to learn more so in only began taking some classes at my high school and went off to  Elgin community college and took their photo classes there and I had some wonderful wonderful teachers that really helped me out and guided me and actually sent me on my way and said you know what factor to to leave here go out into the world sticking together then they kick me out yeah   is a champion of the world and said you know what you need to go to you need to get to work in the business so you know I found a job in photography and you come here to Chicago to know it was it was out in the suburbs  I was working with a gentleman by the name of Michael Camacho is right started I think was eighteen years old and work for about three years with Michael come much and I knew that you know I knew very little I knew very very very little I mean I was really really really you know just getting my feet wet and trying to figure this whole thing out you know Michael shot food and product  I knew as I was reading that I needed to get downtown I need to to get into a big metropolitan city start working with some of the bigger name for two  the first  we're coming down to of tower by the name of David deal goes by the name mean big deal now and I came down and saw David and his wife Rosemary and and knocked on their door beautiful beautiful studio on Harvard street I was just I walked in I was just like in all scenes just magnificent photographs on the wall is just absolutely beautiful  basically told  David and rose merry remember I said that interview together with them and said I will do anything for you clean your toilets answer your phones washer floors  I would just like to be here in the studio and  I'll do anything in David I remember Dave looking goes you know what I really love your attitude but I just  really don't need anybody right now  and the next day rose merry called means as we watch back in the studio we really loved your attitude so when you come back and work for us makes a huge difference when you're really willing to put yourself out there I know I start the same way working working for the studio just for free yeah to get in yeah  yeah you need the apprenticeship to really get in and and understand the business and how it works you really really really do any and I think it's very important to also start at the bottom yeah I mean a lot of kids come out of school today they come to work for me  you know a big big big  educator of five Columbia College now use a lot of their students and they're good they're good they're good good good workers but I think you know the working mentality is little bit different today in a lot of them have hopes of coming in and getting right and camera in you know you really need to learn and start right  the bottom and learn what it takes to have a presentable studio you know learned at that toilet is very very important to be clean when your clients come in at the floors need to be clean food needs to be out there they need to be taken care of you know you're basically a runner for the first three four years but a good runner will get his job done  and then come out into the studio and learn what's going on in the studio you know there's the best way I think to learn you get in here you start from the bottom you do your thing it do it do it well you do it to perfection and get out there and you know everybody  industry that the full time crew sees what's going on anyone involved yeah that's one of pitfalls with people coming out of schools today everything's happening at the speed of light  literally I mean the singer images or other people's images on a screen and it can go from one website to the next were you know again like you really this is your education around in this incredible collection of books and it's a much slower pace of investing time and researching other photographers and sitting there seem to work and how they captured like how they captured their subject  and really understanding that which is very different I think it's a pitfall for people coming out of school today cameras do so much  the web moves at such a fast pace that's very hard to slow down and really mastercraft yeah you're so right I mean  your photography is part of my  every day in the life you know  this isn't something that I do part time and I've done it full full time has been part of my life every single day for my whole life the last forty years you know what to make that decision when I saw that work by Irving in  new that I want to be a photographer I needed  you know my job to learn everything I possibly could about photography and you know I have close to eight hundred books in which I you know I I buy these books right and they inspire me you know I dream about you know how this whatever qualities amazing images I dissect the images really look at trying inside the photographers had where was he at what was his idea what was he trying to achieve that day the lighting I mean it's  eight a single image has is so complex a great single images so complex in a few can really create something as powerful and make it iconic there's so much it goes into that shot  how long did it take you to actually refer to yourself as a photographer I know you were working in the photography industry but how long did it take for you actually said you know I'm I'm working photographer what a great question you know  I was eager to take to get out there and get on my own but  I think the education that I got you know working about four years with David deal was a great apprenticeship I mean I learned a lot about the business  I learned a lot about what it takes to to do a brilliant photograph a photograph with an idea something that's an impactful I learned about advertising I learn about promotion which is probably when the biggest parts of our business that I think a lot of young photographers don't understand in I believe heavily having a promotion  so you know it was four years with David you know three years out in the suburbs and probably another two years of freelancing try almost  okay good close to get tenure dues of working for other people before I decided that I was ready to go out there and open my own studio and I went out there as was working you know I'd work a day which I mean we were to David's twelve fourteen hours a day six days a week David was probably the busiest photographer when the business in the country for sure in Chicago you know working against six days a week we were nonstop and it was my responsibility to every single morning that studio had to be spotless so we may have shuttle ten o'clock that evening I'd have to stay in under two hours and prepare pre light clean studio have it all set up for the next day and then  can be in my car go back out to Elgin as a single parent raising a daughter by myself it was insane you know but I remember also finding time to get into David's studio and working on my portfolio so it was a twenty four seven job to get to that place refining thought comfortable to go out on my own and do my thing and what were your first images you were you were drawn to the portraiture an American photo you working for a photography shooting a lot of product and so yeah so what was your first four full and first my first images were all product yeah they were beer poor here can   their product  so I hadn't quite yet    full of my  needs of shooting people it will it is starting to build because I remember  having my own studio in first counting at which was  you know it was just crazy crazy money but I was working from Montgomery wards  and that you know I was a product shooter but I felt something was wrong and I thought my soul just really kind of like crumbling knows that I was dying creatively others died you just or something wasn't happening for me and then when they click because when my doing one way during shooting you know this product up I'm a people person I love people I love people's faces I love to you know to brace people I love to interact with people why my shooting jewelry why am I shouting product unite in in in at that moment right there I made the decision that that was yeah yeah I remember what I did as it is I went out and I would like to blues clubs in Chicago  and I'd stay there for the whole show in at the end and I to go to the blues artists in asking for could do photo session with them  they come to my studio in a we do these amazing photo sessions  junior wells Buddy Guy John Lee Hooker while just these amazing guys that I was able to talk into coming to my studio that night like would you guys go back with the father was somewhere  the whiskey something now the  I mean we've got all night long you know  shooting Borchers you know these guys be partying like crazy in I'd be shooting them and it was like oh my god this is unbelievable and that at that time I really could even you know doing my work I can you know for an assistant some doing all this by myself you know and I get these guys their portraits they would be happy I was like you know  your total war top of the world because I for two I love the blues music in an  I'm shooting the best blues artists in the world but that's how I built my first people portfolio for the really interesting lessons there is you're in the industry that you love yeah that was your dream and you're miserable because you were doing the exact sector that you wanted to see issues you switched yeah everything fell into place for everything fell into place and I was a new person of the note energy that happened you know with with my work in a new new enthusiasm also and I felt like I had reason  you know take that this camera was going to open doors  all over the world for me to meet some of the most interesting people in the world  your portraiture really runs the gamut I mean this black and white is really gritty with great  there's colors very highly polished production so when you're thinking about a portrait like when you go down to the blue square when you went on the blues clubs were you watching the guys thinking about what you want to shoot then or did you wait to kind of get back in the studio one where your inspiration for the poor to come like we're just at the ballot well in in the beginning and the beginning again I I I really feel that  Irving Penn was such a huge influence in my career and my life  that I would only sailing mimic is fine but it was a huge inspiration and meet you know it was very classic lighting up one light was really my thing you know maybe two maybe a little bit of a background light but I kept it simple you know in I believe I still believe I still believe today in keeping it simple I don't think you need to have ten lights to make a better picture I think you can make a great great great  sure with one light I need I think it's you know it's the I. it's the idea to composition it's the mood it's at little secret that you're able to pull from your subject that makes your viewer want to know more about that person is very very very simple to very simple idea  but it's hard to do I mean it's hard you have to pull up the right emotion and we know a motion is the connecting piece right now neck that's withdraw the person to be ran that's a difficult thing to pull out in a way that's really effective yeah you know I've I've found the best way to work with people whether you working with you know and an amazing celebrity like John Malkovich  Michael Jordan or just a  a simple normal person off the street is respect respect and honor  I always like to try to spend some time to get to know my  subject before a shoot them I'm really big on  having a nice gentle conversation with them I'm never demanding very soft and very hands on I I love to grab my subjects hands and feel their hands and hold them for the first second might be weird for you know I think the  but you know I hold a great but then they feel the gentleness I think in my hand and I think they hear my voice something happens to them Davison begin it's safe yeah they know that they're in the same have you always done this like well it's about a man so since the the days of the blues yes that's that started yeah I'd just like it's my demeanor being gentle and nice and honorable and respectful in any situation in life you're always come out ahead  what's relationship is business it takes a long time to build these relationships takes a long time to win a client him really nice you know you don't lose them the answer you have to build a relationship you know  even though I've been in this business for forty years and probably one of the most sought out photographers in the world I'm still very very very grateful for every single job that I come in comes into my studio because they could have gone to somebody else you know I am not  you know  someone who's going to give you something that's so different that you probably could go to Najaf Connor any legal which our Watson or mark Seliger or any  number of of of of other photographers of when I compete against those people and you get that job for me it deserves into a graceful mess that you've got that job you're very very very lucky there's there is a thousand other guys out there and women that what your job absolutely you know and  they can go to a job and a lot of are much much cheaper cheaper than I am so it's when you get that job very grateful for any treaties you treat your client with gratitude  let's talk about hands  when I look at your website I I find it really fascinating that Hans was one of the three still image galleries that you have  they're obviously hugely influential for you and I think that's a big niche  that you're really putting out there just for an entire gallery of hands yeah how much work you think that drugs for you and what do you what do you think clients perception of that hang gallery is when you're viewing because I think it speaks a lot about you as you have time thank you I'm well I tell you  I've been shooting hand for thirty years you know I hand you look at a hand like a face as a novel line and it has a story about a person it tells you a lot about that person near the lines in a person's eyes underneath the I. two crow's feet tells me stories about a person I think I first learned this when I should my American bikers project about twenty seven years ago you know is traveling around the country shooting shooting bikers and you know instead of doing the bike on top of the bike you know and and and have it pulled back shot portrait I came in tight you know and I started seeing stories at thirteen novelty starts in the road on these bikers faces and then I saw other he ends their hands at work with its equipment work with these tools work on these bikes they were tough they were strong today they had grease underneath the fingers they told stories told me a lot about who these people were you know so it just became a huge part by you know  my love of of a target in an H. and H. electric against like portrait twenty or just like portrait but I've had some tremendous campaigns  that I've worked on over the years that were just surrounded by hands and it's something I'll always effectuate me so let's let's talk about projects and it seems that you have been so prolific you produce multiple books had countless exhibitions  just in order to do all you must be working multiple projects at the same time how do these projects formulate for for you and how long do you put into them meaning a lot of these things obviously happened over the course of a year or several years yeah yeah  well you know for for me  as a commercial photographer you know  it's always been extremely important for me to show my clients my personal work and work the comes from my heart and my soul you know  I may   solver when it comes to the commercial work and I love solving problems I love making project you know really turn around and be  wonderful for my clients clients  but I think for me it's been so important for me to do personal work and released me in touch with the work that I want to create in use this work as an Avenue to also show my client I think one of the reasons that I am today and still on top of the game you know at my age and it's it's a young young person's game yeah it can be a young person's game in less your true   truly dedicated and  continue to change and evolve you can beat up in this business very early  but  I've worked on personal projects that I think you have moved  people even in the commercial world and for me it's been so important to to travel to Morocco spend a month in Morocco  shooting people that  I get it with that project I was paying homage to  August Sanders and Irving Penn you know the work of working people portraits that idea  Cuba I spent thirteen years going back and forth to Cuba to work on my book for Cuba  it takes dedication passion  I love for creating imagery but what also I find these personal projects as is often I'm back to my first days of photography when I just traveled with a thirty five millimeter camera in a couple inches you know I'm not with the a team of twenty people and there's something very very very calming and and nurturing about walking the streets by herself looking for these amazing images these gems and photographing them I mean it really gave me that break from the hustle bustle crazy commercial world that I live in and it was a way for me to I I guess in some ways to  justify my being in an era of and not just be a commercial photographer but being an artist you know if it was very very very important for me to be an artist and to have my work accepted by  others that were not in the commercial world you know galleries and museums any kind of solidified for me that   the importance of creating imagery of of of of energy that's not for hire it takes a certain amount of dedication because you your you know what when I close my studio down for a month it's a huge overhead my boys are still being paid you know the wheels are still trying to electric still on they'll still have to the bills to have to be paid so I leave the studio to go do month project in those bills still a star rolling in so it's a huge huge huge our financial  me in  burden to go do these projects but it's a must yeah I would   just to all photographers out there you know young especially is is never give up your passion for photography to create your own work and I think that's what you're gonna get known for I I I I I think when I noticed last days of your life  not gonna go down to a shot another McDonald's hamburger absolutely mother a had for so  you know it's it's a great great living in it it makes a great problem solver but I don't think it's what you want to find yourself by I think the other thing is really beautiful about doing personal work and being free from the big cruise and and were you just out to Cameron a couple answers initial back to the basics so it's like an athlete who like Michael Jordan who would just practicing jump shot over and over and over again even though he's the best basketball player in the world it keeps his skills sharp yeah I think that's very very evident in your work the personal work that you do it has continued to grow your skills is continue to hone them and be a master which is ultimately what you want to be in what you've achieved thank you very much you know you're you're you're so correct I mean so often when we're shooting even a commercial job things happen in an instant things change something goes wrong but it's all about the experience that you've had in the past you know shooting life career whether it be your personal work or your your commercial work you draw and that and that past you draw on the knowledge that you've gained over time that helps pull you out of what could be a very very embarrassing difficult absolutely in the studio and expanded job yeah you could really blow and  it's again when you master the skills it keeps you common it gives you the ability to I can handle this yeah it's just another corpus speaking of production tell me about your production team do you rely on the most like what does your team make up  well the my team that I have working for me right now  is the greatest team in the world   I have  Akeem Zach saving my producer   Aaron for making my first assistant in Aaron Alan Martin you know my manager these guys make the studio run  their tap match their experts it with the deal and without them what I do really  couldn't possibly get done this isn't the type of business that you can do it on your own I am getting calls from all over the country  to get work done and produced now you know and these guys are willing to stay what ever takes how many hours it takes to get the job done they're the ones who do the hiring of my stylist my hair and makeup people my set builders my location scouts my models metallic I set builders again it takes it takes an army to do a single photograph and these guys have got my back in I owe so much to my team in this in an amazing team I have known it had in the past I've always seem to have had really really really really a great in house team at very important to me that the really good people  beyond that the Kerry people yeah and that  they understand but they have almost that same passion I have for the work photography and it's difficult you know when your producer in your system you're doing all the hard work for somebody else you have these dreams of going out and do it yourself I mean their sacrifice their into these guys sacrificed so much for  you know for my career and you have to embrace and love people like that I think a lot of photographers today think that you know most working photographer shooting ninety percent of the time how often would you say you are you know actually behind the lands and shooting and how how much of the time is in on the business side of things sure I'm I used to shoot  probably two hundred fifty days a year up you know you spend an airplane constantly  as I've grown in my projects get much bigger   much more involved  much bigger money  the competition the people competing against are the big big big bellies  you know the jobs are  our last year there's not as many of them today I'm probably shooting  maybe three jobs a month  maybe for jobs a month are not including the pro bono I do I do a tremendous amount of pro bono and for and and foundation work which again I find the very important work to do  but the works that I do are there bigger ideas you know they bring me in in the beginning of their campaigns in the foundation that that the building of the campaign and brought in to you know help out with the ideas and can have a bring it to the forefront of what  this campaign could look like so I shoot a lot less I'm also directing a lot now so I mean I'd say probably about  twenty five thirty percent my work now is directing TV commercials documentaries  and  you know get other personal projects but to  I shoot every day or closed everyday but commerciales probably just you know three four jobs a month would create up to about seven eight ten days a month and then you'll have your month three you have to be booked every single day  so it's it's a constant in then you know of course like you mentioned you know I have this I have this disease and a disease of creating images and working on his personal work and it's a sickness thank you have a it's a sick yes good sickness that's a good thing because I I've been a lot of trouble if I get sick  but it is an illness because you have this passion of wanting to create imagery constantly kick your wife but you can't get away from it and I have the hardest time  knowing how to enjoy the moment you know  I have seven books that have been published I'll receive a book that forty years and years and years I and I can't even look at it you know when I received the book from the publisher it's hard to look at it it's hard to look yeah yeah I'm never really really really had a listing what you see other things you want to change and that person is what it is and it's hard to live in the moment yeah this is great I it's hard to live in the moment right now I'm supposed to be enjoying this moment of this you know this I'm getting a a lot of publicity and this Malkovich project I did yesterday a new   working into my vocabulary is called trendy never heard of the word trending you're currently but I I heard I was trending on CNN Twitter and Facebook India okay him trendy talk about the project is it's a really big important one and it's with John Malkovich we've been working with now for a long time and again this is a really deep and important relationship to you it is  talked to me a little bit about how that first of all it did not come through with I kind of know it wasn't within a company Nikon became part of it it began probably got seventeen years ago with that Steppenwolf theater  they brought me in to begin shooting their ensemble members for their different advertisements marquees billboards but it all involved there ensemble members instead of having the sensational ensemble listed they have you know Gary Sinise Joan Allen  we'll figure in a two credible and John Malkovich happen to be one of the ensemble members that needed that to be shot for a play that he was in in I remember John coming in and I was just having just an amazing an amazing aggression I digress sure I got my name kissed him on the forehead  you know one but  you know I remember being a little bit intimidated at first you know with John because John is a powerful figure  and a big actor is a big big big actor he's a powerful figure in I think you can let you know whether you want to talk to you are not you know just those ice   but we had beautiful beautiful session together we had we created some amazing black and white portrait of a man  you know I think I hit home with John data again respect factor that I had for him but we we created we create some really really really good work I think you two are doing some very risky work initial things are you guys doing pretty going motion side is very Lasky and I think that obviously to have a great trust each other and have found a way to to be very free with each other's okay let's this is what we want to try yes well I think you nailed it when you said risky I mean we're definitely outside the box we can be dark were taking chances of John is  you know  this is amazing genius   he's a beautiful clean canvas for me to work on he allows me  allows me and my ideas to  formulate in and happened he's never said no to me about any idea that I've had with him  you know he mentioned to me one time to center I work with with Indian Bridget and  mark can lead to big for two hours but there's something about you the way that you work that I really really trust and I really enjoy working with you E. ainda  you know it pretty much was I know will be working together for probably a long long long time it's now it's been seventeen years yeah yeah I think it gets down to respect I think no walking they respect some of the other photographers a works with him  and they respect him I think that the two of you just have a really deep respect for each other and have built a relationship and trust over time we have I have to say that I love the man and I have a lot of gratitude and I'm very grateful for his generosity and his  this time is giving me his  openness I mean in in in some ways he's responsible for  you know  a huge piece of my successes in with this exhibition that we have going on right now to get them out in the gallery   this home March to the masters  I felt as it was in very important work to do and I really thought there's nobody else in the world they could have pulled it off like John Malkovich is very important for me to get John on board to do this project and you know I remember flying out to France showing John my idea of recreating you know thirty thirty five iconic images from about thirty twenty eight to thirty master photographers and the service about men women and what men and women both roles which is also different Leah I mean think about it I mean the risk that John is taking  yeah up put himself out there is Marilyn Monroe you know it could have been laughed at I I mean I didn't want this to be a purity I would it was a serious serious serious Ammash to these masters who have really inspired me in kind of developed to I am today's a photographer and I meant it to be a very serious project in when you think about some of the  iconic images that you know together John and I are created   he really did an amazing job pulling it off you know we get our researchers nine about nine months of research on on on all these images that we wanted to create we had to go back to the errors of when they were shot  we had to figure out the clothing the styling  the hair the make up that they were wearing all this had to be made  brought in from all over the country we had seems just working on wardrobe and then I had to spend three weeks figured out the lighting of exactly what kind of like to do to talk first were using at these times of these portraits  planning and cranky production will really this is a huge time invest it was a huge time huge financial huge huge financial investment but it was an idea that I felt  that I needed  to conquer and to put out there you're so often today's artists I think we get ideas and we end up sitting on them in we don't follow through I think right we can be our worst enemies you know you get an idea write it down in try to follow through in it you know I think some people are worried about not doing the right thing or or it not being accepted by the masses you know I think we have to take our ideas and we have to  formulate them and we have to follow through it we have to make a Mars yeah we're gonna get some criticism nobody's gonna love everything that we do you know but I think you have to take a chance unix courage it takes courage and you have to challenge yourself you have to just you know put yourself out there and I was taking a huge risk in doing this work here in you know I know that it could keep office appeared in people could have seen it as  you know mocking or disrespectful in that would hurt you know  what I was trying to do very very very much so I'm very pleased with what we've got it's been a  good success and I'm a trend or not  congratulations thank you  on the production side of that how long did you spend on let's say one photograph how long will it take you to complete that on the shooting side that's a great question because  in every job every job I do that I believe in doing your homework  and  figuring out  all what could go wrong before it happens  so can we did nine months of research you know we knew we had the wardrobe right my stylist Leslie pace the amazing job you know working with great great great  seems seamstress Yutaka who built the clothes you had to close here their proper my great great great here make up  artist Randy Wilder who research for months and months and found the here so RMIT Ernest Hemingway Einstein   Marilyn Monroe brought in shape with a beard and actually built that right and Josh you know we we we did our work way ahead of time and then the fact that I had every single shot  three let where the take it all down and to take very close to but we live every single shot that we did had a time I had a time took very thorough notes to knock it down  so now we got these four days of shooting with John  he Jim all those images in four days hello echo that isn't we create a seven eight shots today fourteen sixteen hour days  what was so interesting was watching John as he's getting his hair and makeup done and styling would put that  original portrait up in the mir were used in his hair make up so he could start getting into his head of how he was going to have to morph into man woman child disturb angry crazy or you know whatever it was you know you take those four shots that herb Ritts did with Jack Nicholson of the joker I mean John had to kind of go this whole gamut of craziness but he again with genius Reno pulled every single one of these images off so Julie and sat I would give John direction would start talking we start getting into the mood would start going back to that time that you know Mick Jagger was in front of David Bailey's camera Maryland rows in front of birds turns can we talk about what they're probably doing  yeah pull the mood in in what Hemingway was you know he anyway was struggling alcoholic he was going to free difficult time of his life and car shot him so I'd get John in that mood Janet already worked on sort of where he was going to go inside the dressing room but by the time we got there it was a matter of five minutes inch we were there you know in ten fifteen twenty minutes later we were done  with a shot you know I'm not a guy who have to shoot two hundred frames to know why you have it you know I knew we had it you know the last thing you want to do is have a great talent like John up there in your over shooting him a worried about yeah you don't want to do they have to be very questions yeah there's really going fourteen sixteen hour here's our digital photography is a beautiful thing you can see  you know they have a beautiful thing burning rolls of film making sure that you've cat to be it was a beautiful thing it was the only way truly you know my first thought was I wanted to create this exactly the way that the photographer stratum used with cameras they did what films it'd there would have been virtually impossible yeah you can and then at that me hace you can add that at that pace in John's time is very very very valuable and no I only had the short time with me and he's on the airplane your twenty four seven you know opera theater movies he's got a clothing line of fourteen years that he works on you know this man is is is constantly on the go so we had to be prepared in digital was the only way  simply to get this project done what was the camera that was shot on and a follow up question how important do you consider near  well I I I don't think it's the gear that  create CMH now I think it's the mind  I'm I think it's the idea  the composition  the experience  that really creates the great great great image I think that great images can be taken with so many different cameras cameras   and so many different types of light you know   I can us feel I'm a master of lights you know I I used  thirty forty different types of lighting situations you know in in a shoot  not anyone should but maybe in in a in a month and made do thirty different types of lighting situations  our camera gear you know it's it's it's it's important I think it's more of a two part compatibility would you feel comfortable with you know you know  when I'm shooting thirty five millimeters for the last thirty eight years and I work at night time you know and I can't always been my go to camera when it comes to using thirty five minutes millimeter SLRs you know  the last few years I've become an ambassador for Nikon you know I speak and and lecture you know about photography and  night connection much the sale from like I'm I'm not a sales person at all for them but you know why I I believe in the the equipment in with larger format you know which I often have to shoot medium format  I'm huge huge huge Hasselblad fan I've been a hot sweaty and since day one you know  important  to know your equipment to know what you want to shoot with and you know and and and to grab the right piece equipment for the right job  and  you know for me when it comes to portraiture out I've never been a huge huge fan of  in a thirty five millimeter vertical  shot portrait you know it it's just it's too thin for me and I you know I love the horizontal doing more of a landscape portraiture with thirty five millimeter but when I need to do a vertical shot I need to resort to  to a quarter and give me that six seven for me and it's very important for me and I'm also a huge huge huge lover of the house about square format which of course you can't get with thirty five millimeters so I think you know it's it's the equipment doesn't make you a better photographer it makes you more comfortable with what you're working with  again I think you could probably give me a ten dollar camera  as the camera and I'm gonna probably knock off a pretty beautiful shot for you nice  on that project specifically what camera was used was in a variety of cameras or is it just one of the Malkovich project I used a variety of cannabis yet again I was very important for me to be true to the formats that were being shot by the photographers at that time so of course I use thirty five millimeter I used to and a quarter I used four by five I used Polaroid  well so you know I really really really kind of opened up and was allowed you know the project to flow the way I thought it should be should flow and that's be true to what the photographers were working with what about the post processing on the entire project and impose process in general you a huge part of that are you doing this all yourself is this being given off to a different team I do not know  my hands don't ever touch the computer never it's just not who I am now I'm a director in the visionary you know I'm the idea person  I pass off any retouching that I need done to a wonderful book take place to use J. S. graphics or my guy Aaron is extremely extremely verse with the computer up it's not what I do   I direct when I want done every single Schatten there's not a shot that goes out this this my doors without my  one hundred percent stamp will provide it has my look it has to Sandra look to it  I'm the Malkovich job I used the are you  post like the photographers who created is I kind of shot used the darkroom okay is about dodging in burning vignetting out whatever kind of they did is what I allowed myself to do is images wants to be made in manipulated in the computer to make these images you know I'm really struggling today  with Instagram  photographers who won taking pictures and putting them out into the world with no idea you know they're just popping images just pop up images and then  using these programs that they're hitting the button and they're putting the styles of photography that took people like ourselves along years and years and years to perfect I would argue they're not photographers Instagram is  making photographer exactly a filter in Instagram or whatever doesn't make you photographers and knowing light and how to work with it and knowing composition and knowing your equipment and how how to make a camera second nature in your hands liak and react to your subject of phony that's being a photographer yeah  not hitting the button and Instagram posting I agree and I was a big part of what this Malkovich project was about was about an idea you know eight eight eight big big idea and following through with the big idea and not just putting images out to put images out you know I really think about what images I put out into the market you know are they powerful are they moving are they making people think a little bit in awe and it's you know it's a different world we live in Instagram is  a huge huge part of  our younger generation and it's not going to go away but I'm hoping I'm hoping that maybe I can get this younger generation to maybe just take a look at what they're doing and think about it a little bit more take a look at some classic classic photography can understand really what the ideas were behind these very important photographs let let's talk a little bit of a huge transition and that is directing  no cameras now days being able capture motion has really opened up a whole New World for photographers and and won the consolation is very dangerous it's very difficult for a lot of people to make the transition from photographer to director director of photography  you've been on the absolute for from that and done a beautifully Kinnickinnic tell us a little bit about the process and and the risks that you felt that you were taking is removed from doing so most emotion  well first I you know I I've actually been asked to direct for probably  over twenty years now yet I never stepped into the arena because I truly was enjoying the power of the single image I really believed in the single image and you know I continue to be on top of that game  I was highly sought out  a major major major campaigns doing really really really well  but then I think was time for a change of time for a new challenge and   you know the next step should be was directing in in I. in and really I was a director as a still photographer that's really what I did as a still photographer now I'm just taking moving pictures and putting them in a sequence that makes a fifteen or thirty a sixty second or or a documentary whatever I'm shooting makes the store  you know I've treated very very very very similar to how I  really relate with still photography the key there they'll is  not taking on too much yourself you know it's about to be hiring really good people  you know surrounding yourself with a great great team you know I would find it very difficult to direct and also be the DP  so I chose to just direct in higher grade teepees to work my camera with me I believe I know my clients so much more of who I am and what to look at with the feel of the if of whatever campaign it is that we're working on I just believe that it would been way too much for me to take a and bark  so  I'm enjoying directing very very very much and we've been very fortunate we're going to really wonderful campaigns did you find that I find that this kind of a language berry sometimes between still and motion  did you know I mention it right no question there's some difficulties for a photographer to understand  the language of motion yeah did you run into that and how we have to be overcome absolute  ice now I've been directing for about five six years in I will announce to the whole crew that guys I came from the still world  you put out there but we  that's a supporter me up I said I will say some terminology that's probably not correct you know  you know again first thing I do is I go make friends with the whole crew I go shake everybody's hand thank them for being there and get them to be a you know my  team mate and I do I really want your the again of my board and I truly do explain to me like I came from the still world in my terminology is gonna be live a different than yours but you know it crosses over people get it yeah and  again you know I probably made a few people laughed at some of the you know terminology that I've used during a you know a motion shoot but you know it all works out and I get a lot of fun you know you've got eighty people and said that you're working all to achieve you know one goal is to put out a great spot since a lot of fun you know if it really is another children I would love to get a little information is that of Cuba you were hired by Cuba to photograph their athletes which one how did they find you yeah that's across the highway or loose dirt  if you change money   the phone me I was I was in Cuba in nineteen ninety nine I was working on one of my books that has not been published yet  is a book on boxing and if you're a new book and boxing got to go to you have to go to Cuba because Cuba produces basically  per capita the best boxers in the whole world you know I think that they walk out usually more gold and silver than any other country of course I had to go to Cuba  the government and a government official who is working for the Olympics  ended up seeing some of my work brought the idea to the forefront you know what do you think you know eagles are our country has not had pictures of our athletes since nineteen fifty nine cents cash  took took charge I mean there's NO elimination no more photography in all of our activities in this part of the trade embargo you had actually break through political barriers between the US and Cuba in order to do this is very added the chosen American photographer to do this project you know with the embargo in the battle going on between countries  it was you know  they could have chose somebody else I was there they like my work   maybe a little bit of small is talking  hello I'm the guy  but again I came back and did the project for nothing you know in the reason we did the projects because I ended up shooting ninety of Cuba's  top athletes you know  world champions Olympic gold silver bronze winners are the top baseball players in the world every sport we covered anywhere that the top of the country and again since nineteen fifty nine none of them have been recorded so in the history books there was nothing for their kids to take a look back and read about their heroes as there was no information at all for me nothing  so I can run this country were you know athletes are   pedestal absent we know everything about their whole life absolutely yeah it's incredible yeah we know everything about them you know usually you photographed a ton of of U. S. athletes as well it's been a it's been a very large part of the market it has been yeah  you know I was in the heyday of Michael Jordan and the bulls you know those are good Michael all the time huge advertising campaigns together out one of my favorite shooter  with Mohammed Ali when the most beautiful man and yeah in you know in the world but it was a really special shoot  remember only have a few minutes with with with Mohammed and I was already all set up and we sat him down we did the portrait which took basically about ninety seconds  and I was done this is how they're just a crowd around and I had to release them remember going up there with all these people watching in  I said Mohammad I I must tell you that I've been a huge huge huge fan of of of you  yes I love you in the ring with Howard Cosell but I must say I love you so much more today for what year is it represent as a man into America and as an ambassador of America I so appreciate everything you've done I really think you're out in amazing it is something that sort of turned around I was done I said what I need to say also in this huge hand  on my shoulder turns me around this is when he was still pretty healthy manner strong big he had turned around brings you down to put both hands what is huge hands on my face and kisses me on my lips  thank you those are some of the most beautiful words I've ever heard when I remember right I just started to cry  it just hit me I am just like those Muhammad Ali that just a new user so sincere with what he just said to me better if it moves me to point to tears looking back on your career what would you have done anything differently  I don't think I would have done anything differently I mean so many people want me to move to New York or London  my agents  you know to be the superstar photographer I guess you have to be in New York or London area and  I was a single parent  I made a decision to stay here in Chicago   it was the right decision and I look back at it you know in here sometimes you're  art pose that you know what a half by  the decision was the right decision stay home take care via a my daughter stay close to my mom who helped me so much yet it just felt like the right thing to do so I look back and and and and I like the way that things went in my career there's so many things happen by chance you know the American bikers project that I worked on and never knew was gonna blow up the way it did going to you know an eight page spread in the New Yorker this John Malkovich piece that I'm working on right now you never really know what's going to be that decisive moment that such a career to that next time you know and   it feels good the career felt like it went on the path that was supposed to go see and I'm very happy with everything they said that  me and my team M. as a father as a photographer what we've achieved so when you wanna be when you grow up fifth wanna be a race car driver  Google yeah what Dr green pre cars  these well thank you so much for sitting down with us you're welcome as it's been an absolute pleasure to meet you  you've always been an inspiration for me as a portrait photographer so this is been a fantastic moment for me and  for RG  he's a sitting down with his manager and realize so it's really great to sit down thank you so much guys is like I am a huge pleasure and honor what you guys are doing you guys are doing some great great work and you know it's your your type programming that helps so many of our young photographers  in a dream in the letters and help those dreams come true so they can  \",\n",

S. space so it kind of led me to the blockchain was   interest in systems financial systems and help people out and I think right now the black jeans a lot of great ideas and even go beyond financing fiat currency in  and it's just  when I saw this opportunity I was really excited to be part of the new technology kind of set the groundwork for what you ex will be in the space for the future how people interact with it what it can do is really helping it out with the skills and strengths I have since you got into the industry I recently  sign  Jeez  skills how people  like to start to explore  Jeez how would you recommend them to get into  you know there was a different ways to get into it my recommendations would be start downloading cryptocurrency wallet on your phone and just using them and thinking right how my experiencing this what would I do if there are a ton of meet ups in all size towns and cities where people were blockchain insouciance go to them to network their people are really welcoming in the space they want more people they want to learn they want to build products and just read about it there's a lot of news there a lot of communities out there online if you want to go out and meet people go online and start talking and seeing people are very vocal about what they want right now with their experiences are and I just kind of diving in the taking to get that experience as what we've all been doing since the beginning and they know that there is starting to be a great need for you let's designers across the world in the space so companies are also certainly looking for people with any kind of you experience and willing to kind of bring them up to date on this  a lot of  I said  it's very important to us  a little sometimes uses are any more people  these are really  yeah absolutely yeah definitely and companies are willing to educate communities online and willing to educate there are massive online courses about introducing people to the point even in those are all great  Gary Miller  they were the main  room was kind all male  what would your advice  women are thinking of  she  we don't know where to start  I mean to be hesitant because it is so male dominance  go for it if I have found the space to be very welcoming and very inclusive especially in Denver is that they want everybody in the world to be involved in this and that there  everybody they want to meet you halfway and you just have to go out we have to get there you you see if you are a woman and you Lexi one billion blockchain you already have the skills that I have the strength to go do it just yet just do it yourself out there and just find the people that recognize to ten because you're worth it meet ups  the what local like meetup dot com start meeting people who are just interested start looking on what like community website and seeing where the people are talking about it where it's being mentioned and  yeah I mean I know he can be easier said than done but you have to start somewhere me means we'll start talking to people  yeah  who are already in the  it's less intimidating like  what you just said  a lot of employees  get out  you are worth it they want you they need to  absolutely including people concerned about tech  a certain reputation I have found  teen space itself to be different from other tech areas and Kennedy familiar with general like T.   departments in companies and everything black teen is a little different blockchain is really focused on getting all the voice out there so they want to voice your choices are to be heard  go for it  what  full  this is  and they can be great  sure  now  their abilities   industry  you're welcome  thank you so much for giving me the interview once a  and it was very very interesting to hear your thoughts on blockchain and why he wakes is so important in that area if you guys want to follow the kids on Twitter the link is the low and also there's a link to her personal audio and some other resources that she has recommended for you including books so yes going to the description right now it's scroll down and find it I hope you enjoy this video and I'm sorry about the background noise were at a cafe that was about to close so logically you think people would be leaving it but now it seemed like there was a party or something like that so yeah I'm sorry about the bargain right yes if you have any comments or suggestions or ideas please let me know in the comments below or on my Instagram for my blog hooting burned out home yes book market and subscribe to my newsletter for concert here where can I say it have a wonderful time of the day you're currently experiencing by  \",\n",
       " \"hi everyone how you will  great such a wonderful crab thank you so much for all coming to my told today say my name is Jenny guy and I'm a user experience reset check here it giggle I've been a good go now this month but ten years and I heard that that Kevin sites thank you  I had that that can side with that the number of years we've been having I at conferences say  at Dublin eventually that's really fun said this afternoon we're gonna be talking about developing great  and creating  principles of mobile app design that I want to share with you so that you can create great experiences for your users  I'm why is this important well it's important because there are a sorry there are over one point five million apps in each of the axles as we knows that there's a lot of concentrate better does a lot of competition out that and you don't want your to suffer from usability florals I think usability floor than user experience issues can contribute to the lack of engagement that some apps have so for example we plan that things like twenty five percent of apps sometimes and get use more than once and that thirty four percent about on paper more than eleven times said that these these statistics that are around with regard to you know asking gauge meant to me engagement with doing a lot of work on that issue itself at Google  with certain products that by bringing out but I think it's also want us to like reading  why cannot you know user experience on all our usability issues and not  so I'm gonna tell you about three things and the rest of my talk I'm gonna tell you a story about an experience I had with the not recently I'm gonna tell you about a study that we ran to understand what makes a really great experience and I'm going to go through some of the principles that we have published online so that you can understand some key things that you can do to make you laugh expense bad I mean then those principles I've got a number of resources for you as well that can help you along the way  so my story while I was on vacation with my family here we are we having a wonderful time in Florida that's me and my my partner my kids and before we went on vacation idea setup a series of hotels for us to stay at it was a south driving tool and I pre book these I did that on my laptop  when I got to Florida I found that a lot of hotels and started using the making use great use of that new technologies I specifically in order to give me somebody famous experiences on my check  they do things now like enabling me to check it before I get that's it just like I can for a plane on enabling me to go straight up to my room in order to open the door just with the act that's pretty cool I was pretty blown away by these new things that they were able to do  but  what happened when I was on vacation was the notification to check in came out I was standing in line at  something like this in the roller coaster at the theme park asked me did I want to check in and they also asked me did I want to choose my own room or did I want to let them choose for me welcome back when I booked I remember there was a I went there was a text field and asked me if I'd go any requests and I put in the I wanted to have a city view because I knew at the next hotel there was this beautiful pristine beach I ordered a remake the balcony and I really wanted this wonderful experience looking out over the state but I didn't know whether that ex you know experience on the laptop which translates into this experience that I was now faced with that was a bit concerned about that and you know I thought that I might have a better opportunity of cheese in my M. the mother than letting them choose for me kind of always better to take into your right hand side so I decided to change my name and the experience that they gave me was pretty good on a mobile device actually wet Sunday this looks like it would be quite challenging in terms of in the state but it went quite well they clearly laid out the different rooms and they clearly labeled whether the rooms were taken or open it with anyone problem that and that was I have no idea which way the sea with faces you know which way the hotel was pacing in front of the sea  so  I was a nine and trying to figure out how to how I could so Vance now the west  what commands that I did not she thing called at the time things like I'm getting to the Congo Max maybe I could figure it out or looking on Google images in this case the hotel's father symmetrical  five it would be quite tricky I decided to use a kind of rule of thumb  give a stick and I decided to  I think that the side with the message taken rooms was probably decide that west facing messy  so I decided to cheese room seven hundred and thirty over here so we got to the hotel took up all the banks you know what's going to happen that you  I got a view that looked  right there  big disappointment you know so what did I have to the then what I have to then go all the way down again service sector much I thought I'd buy policy by using that  taught to the receptionist they were extremely helpful lovely hotel fixed it for me and in the end we went back up the different floral meant in the hotel and I got a few that was much more like this beautiful hi this is Ashley Florida it looks like the Bahamas or something was really really nice  so the end hacen guest service was required human intervention was required because the I hadn't really did it if the service I typed it worked it done so well I was really taken with this new technology I could Jeez but it fell short back has it hadn't delivered this critical piece of information for me which was you know I just needed some information on the map in this case I just needed a view of the ocean packs a few weights I just needed some orientation  so for me it was pretty critical that my view was all of this beautiful beach rather  then this call call and you know it could have been even more critical than mine you know very M. did to me vacation it could obtain an event manager booking for a client perhaps it could have been people booking for guests for a wedding or something  what I said is there and that's how we as developers and designers really need to understand the whole flow that I use as a going through I'm where that breaks down this it's been really cool new technology but I'd have to sort of backtrack through the whole thing and do those things that the act was supposedly saving me from doing so really understanding that experience from beginning to end and I think a mobile it's really those little things that we we don't realize we need to cover and so that's why we really and the need to understand the user's perspective and the users experience with that  so my talk is gonna be about things like that and how we can fix them let me give you a little history  I have years ago we found that a lot of experiences on the mobile web or particularly problematic for people and so we conducted a large study and try to understand where things one being implemented right for the mobile when and where we could do better and we release this after twenty five principles for the mobile web those of them made the wow people have used them as a kind of initial step in making a good foray into providing a better user experience on the mobile web  but asks as well as those of done we've had people come back to us and said this is great for the mobile web but my app what about my apple you  can you tell me about my son had lots of polls to do another study and the study are not so that's what we've done more recently we've looked at a native and a study and said the principles I'm going to present to you today are the result of that wet  so in this study we've been able to understand patents that lead to poor user experience says and then luckily Anne and I hopefully we were able to see where some companies have implemented things in a better way and understand why those plans what better and bring those to you as well and it is important to us for us to really understand this well say that  we can be confident in the principles that were telling you about and you can be confident in implementing them in your own products  so in order to do the study we partnered with a company called onsite lab that we use our experience consultancy based in San Francisco me partnered with them because they could help us scale because we wanted that study to be pretty large scale  we studied interaction on a hundred different apps on may about said these ranged from large retailers through to smaller service providers we looked at news that we looked at many different sorts of services like great to be services travel services  retail small I'm big companies we didn't look at games as part of this and that was on purpose because we felt that would weaken or dilute the principles  within games probably have a whole different set of principles so am aside from that we we looked across a wide range  your ****  I'm we can set the base that is in San Francisco and Chicago and New York City  now that well a hundred new three participants that took part in this study say for usability study that's really big  they came into the lab individually each for ninety minutes said that makes a hundred and fifty five hours of usability studies say if you stayed up all night and all day that would be almost a week with no breaks or you know in reality it's more like  mice full weeks of of  working weeks  set at a large that indeed and not say that we could cover these different verticals  what did we do in the study well people came into the study and during the ninety minutes they were able to use around six apps visit you know really getting into some good toss for each of those they brought in that room friends with them and that was because we wanted them to be really familiar with the fair and we didn't want any problems because it was a different device so they went used to the back button or anything like that so we had about fifty percent on android I'm fifty percent on iOS  and then what did we do when they're when the study so we had a friend costs and different scenarios set up for them and we did our best to make that Thomas kind of mean something to them as well so that they couldn't do what we call satisficing which is just kind of doing that tossed as as soon as I can and and and as quick away as they can we wanted them to care about the task  so we often talk to them about things that they had about in this example we might talk to them about their favorite food and understand what it is from them fast before then going to ask them to see if they could order it for dinner that evening and we had them speak out loud using what's called in use of usability terminology think about protocol we did that say that we could understand the pain points that day hit as they were going through the different toss that they were doing and we could understand where things flowed really smoothly full of them  so having done that we took the data that was a lot of data which you can imagine from that match usability material I'm we've collected it down to twenty five principles said that this is something that you can take can understand and apply to your own  we've categorized the principles into six chapters but before I go into them I want to explain that how we actually got to these twenty fine so in order to make it into the twenty five principles we have to see that this was a problem across the Ryan white range of fascicles and that we had just see that it was a fairly common problem we did encounter more things in twenty five things that were problematic in apps but we wanted to make sure that we were hitting the biggest problems and that we all say so better ways that these could be implemented  okay so the different chapters that we have  around navigation and exploration  an access  comments and conventions  registration  former entry  and usability and comprehension  now  we've got twenty five of these different principles but having this talk I'm just gonna go into two principals from each of the truck says and the rest of the principles of available to you online I've also pull together some resources for you that can help with the implementation of some of the things you see here and that might be a good time to take a picture of the screen as is if it's a loss that you can look into in your own time in more detail  okay said that starts off with navigation and exploration said this chapter is really about guiding use as to the content that they're looking for quickly so we put together a set of key principles to help you create effective and delightful navigation so that's take a look at some of these now  so a feature that can be really of great how to use as is or type detection of location  but don't assume that that location based task is necessarily based in that current location without exception I think we saw this too often so it's a really great thing to be out to implement and help you know face a seamless experience for users when they want something that's located where they are but basically we store it over a pride without a way of enabling people to change application so in this example somebody's looking for a hotel tonight and then looking up for her time there where they   and  unfortunately while they can change the location and the any  there is probably guys three settings I'm we saw this problem in not only travel apps but we saw it also may be to Allah we still use cases of people wanting to find something in a store  but that perhaps was located name whether parents live and they wanted to figure out you know if it was in the store near them said that they could tell my parents about not   so it just it just  only providing this week basically be missing too many use cases that were outside of the tsunami and in travel we saw at my people would turn up for the transportation and the hotel that they wanted to but was at the other end to the other end of the train line and they have time now to book the hotel but then  in that place where that  wet then needing the hotel at the time let much medicine now yeah is distilling able people to use a common location but to provide  the results for them to change that well so basically great great so that you know technology here that you definitely encourage you to use but it's kind of ever applied without using some of the screen in the state to enable them to change location  if you do want to use the auto detecting location then Google places API enables you to discover that have any supported location I'm we've got a show and be that to get to that material  so another aspect of navigation and exploration that we saw a fair bit with  is  moving people from that to the mobile web and you can see in the way I've written this principle that you know that I have all issue  with the message that's why I'm so wet conditions the needed so where they are needed make non fiction last so I think the idea I have is you know  are they really needed in each case for doing it which trying here at Google to make technologies to make this a lot smoother this transition way you need to do it but you know at the moment we still see at least some sort of performance hit so many consider what you whether you have to push people out to the mobile web when that in Iraq to experience right now and then make them friction last say in this example we've got somebody he's checking in for a flight this can be a quite usual situation where people  I moved out to the mobile web but what we often solo and not not just in trouble that's another tsunami is is well we so the experience changed fundamentally so we saw something like this  okay and it can sometimes happen I think because of the organizational structure of teams you know this is the act team and this is the mobile web team and they haven't been token enough   so I think you know companies some companies are doing a better job of bringing these teams together say enable them to plan the user experience the look come fail and how how content is laid out and and then separating out for the actual implementation on different platforms so and much better experiences when companies have been really thoughtful about this and you can make that look and feel very seamless even though you're just moving out you know right out to the mobile when  on android with doing some work on this and we've got some technology co crime  stem taps it you should look into it's very helpful for enabling you to do things like changing the toolbar Kyla and exit and enter animations to make the whole process of moving from that to the mobile web mostly nice  moving on to the second at chapter here so the importance of great an upset with the company and the estimated so that's talk about a couple of crucial such implementations  so how many did displaying the sat failed we found is that when we did and the mobile web study about the importance of that  so on the poor example we have set in a place where people expect to look for it but it's not how they expect to find it as as as as a text a piece of text ten what we saw in the study was people kind of did have some frustration looking around the set sometimes it was hidden under a menu  and they found one of the most obvious things but I think what I ate my summary of what I saw in the study was that   developers and designers on implementing  like consistent such assistance that failed enough  we advise at this distance such food should be included when such as a really quite significant part of your experience in Europe I think what's happening is plenty of people that thinking that set is important but not that important to debate the screen where the state save so I'm you know check that out and you know I am you know should you be giving it more prominence and you currently on  so we have a vice on this it material design and we have  at this distance that's putting and sat photo may also have expandable such  where we had the Looking Glass icon that that can be expanded for such of course think about the prominence of such in your eye and how much it really matters to people when you're making that decision about which type of set she should implement  and then for implementation details we have the sets dialogue on the sets which it and this link will take you to more information about that  what about fell to and sort options hugely important again we often so that they were hidden old also to buy rate of five the damn people couldn't get to them as much as they needed that's what I'll study that we just did recently showed you know we did see great implementations of it but still that's more what to be done things like getting down to two hundred and forty two results for a shot with no way to kind of fell to assault them fathom so a better implementation is to have a really nice play button cell sap people can know to see that quite clearly and easily and then this example for a powerful you have this panel sliding out with all the right call sorts of such options for them so you could start sort by best match latest collection that kind of thing one one thing I still with the filters like this well as  some companies but taking for example the sizing away when the infantry wasn't available and that caused the problems with people because they they didn't know if they would ever have that size in stock so imagine you know extra small being taken away just because it wasn't in stock people didn't know if it come back better experience that that is something like  you know enabling them to sign up to find out when it's back in stock stock but suddenly showing and sharing and then as the stable state is good said Hey you have cut as in price and one other thing I like about this design is it's very clear when you   claiming the filters or applying the filters and then a separate check at the top in order to close the panel said that there's no confusion about what closing the panel does  so keeping on this topic of fat  we have other methods that  will help with people with desks at one of those is adding custom suggestions that can be created from data and your application that said that can really help people with that sets and another one is a recent gravy suggestions so all of these  technologies and facilities can go to make that such expense better so thinking through that such experience the mode that is is a good topic  comments and conventions so use is expected waiting smooth enough experience for finding landing back I'm purchasing products so let's look at a couple of things that the study revealed about comments and conventions and helping to drive that convention experience  so enabling comparison shopping features  so in this example on the active women I've been a stay Tapia and people that just that only able to scroll down and look at the different Hines anything they like they have to commit to memory and people you know what us you and me we will cognitive mais as we don't like to use up  inside my trailer eight am and way making the use the use that brain a lot have remembering where they sold things insightful but we can do bad up and some of those things that we sold sold that were implemented to help people in this way were letting people kind of book mop items that they soul so that they can combat that is still pretty difficult  on mobile to do this but still anything we can do helps  so the example I'm gonna show you hair cut enable people to compact and then you can say it's quite constraints you know with the size of the phone but still you're bringing that information together it means they could ignore while all the other items that they didn't care about and they can compare the bedrooms they can come by the bathrooms the the cost of the home and so forth we know this is needed because in this study we saw people do work around that and SO in retail we saw people add items to that caught just so that they could look at them all in the same place and that was the uses that thought about doing that other other people struggled so we know this is needed so I think about the comparisons and the browsing experience that people and meeting with Daniel at  and then making it easy to add manage payment methods I actually I came across a poor example of this the other day and it was when I went to  patches that I was I was going on vacation again I like to go on vacation  and  I was making a reservation for a rental home and I got  to the point where I needed to  update my cards say my model in my head was well a new car did arrive and say is simply the same card as before and it just had a new daytime it in my mind my mental model my card says the same card just needs replacing is not a new payment method so I expected to be out to edit my existing cards but there was no facility to do that so I kind of have to understand the developers model that I needed to add a new payment method  in this example that the person's got to the point where that space to be checking out but there's no way to edit console adding you called  that somewhere else in some other settings but you know most of us don't think well you know I'm gonna wake up in the morning and think I need to manage my payment methods and I kind of as a sector activity right we tend to think about it when we need to do it when we come to pass  so this is a problem here so I'm in this example is much better that's an option to add to existing Hans I the new payment methods  and the provide multiple payment methods here and the people to a very clean form design here when the use of its chosen to pick to add any credit cards  and they can even scan that card if they wish to say making that experience nice and clean  now one facility that we offer it at Google is android plan pays say making that a choice of one of the ways to pay  the idea here is is is really simple for the user and CMS for the user to pay through android pay and those I think there's a talk about him I am and that's more information that you can get at this link  seven distribution registration is really popular out with that you know companies and developed as because it seems to be that that way we can get engagement from the user and that's kind of where the use that commits to us we've known for a long time that providing these registration barriers up front can be a big hurdle for people to get to and it's better to offer them something fast and say that they can fail a you know start to failing gauge my from that site to the company and there's a couple of other things I want to talk about today with regard registration so we saw uses struggle with signing in and signing up it's a tricky thing right we often so use is starting to fill out a form if they were provided one and realizing they with signing a mind that was supposed to be signing up and vice versa probably happen to all of us and so we found a better experience when people would just given the option to sign in or register the words were very different they could differentiate them and then that we could channel them down the right kind of route said that they didn't get into that model  we have lots of solutions for registration and identity at Google we have a whole identity platform that I'd encourage you to look at  is base isn't basically an old system and it has several components and different choices for you to make  so one of these is signed them for android enables the user to sign in with the same credentials that they use on Google makes the whole intent is to make that process more for seamless and simple for them  and talking of that there's other ways to make password authentication of friction less experience  we've all been in this situation where it just doesn't work out for us and it's quite painful a may ball to keep put your password in and it's not working it can be even less in apps because we often find that this was a place where people were sent back out to the mobile web right say then you're in that leap again and that's even more aggravating say we've talked about one solution for easing fat enabling people to sign in another one that we saw that's becoming much more popular is fingerprint sign it  and in our study people were pretty am happy about this they like the idea very much of doing this so I think this is a good thing to look and see  and we have some more implementation details for you for you here by using fingerprint scans on supported devices  I'm not lock is another part of IT  identity system enables you to automatically sign uses into the act using credentials that they've saved said that Sir another really good one part of this federated identity provision and  if you haven't got that far with uses does also sign and hit on this M. allows us to use the credentials  I TI it enables you to give hints to the use of a signing in for that use the name and email address everything is done to kind of ease that sign in and huddle  so for men three we've been talking at the you know in design about full Menteri for years and yes we did a lot of black on full Menteri for  for desktops and  when we went to the mobile web we kind of had to re learn all about again and again you'll remember when those forms used to be really really tiny and you have to expand them to to fill out the form it's always been a little bit backed up with that because would be designing forms from the get go for the mobile devices but I'm pleased to say I think we've come a long way but that's that was still things we saw enough study  that could be improved  so I've kept crisis on the building user friendly forms and some of the things I soul with stills some apps requiring users to do a lot of work on that part putting that cast of in several different fields but that phone numbers and things like that takes a lot of effort on the part of the user and also not being out to see what form fields were coming up was a problem for use as it was hard for them to sort of build a mental model of what they would have to fill in next to a close in frustration and was definitely a friction points  so better engagement here is doing  work on the back and so you know whether the user wants to writes in that phone number with dashes in between the numbers with spaces in between that number is always just one long failed we need to  to cater for that and make it is a little bit more what for us on the development side but it makes it a whole lot easier for the user to understand what they're doing and not get you know and and  returns so will say you know whether our am is providing those in line is really helpful and here we have  and not that does a really good job of like moving the form up the field as a user fills the end and we we found that was a very advantageous to use as  so we have a lot of information on creating great tax bills three material design tells a lot about the different aspects of creating a good phone  and for specifically for places we can use places order completes as part of the place is a P. I. again and this time may be helpful and  filling in those phone fails that require location  another aspect to form design is matching the keyboard with the required text input this is a fairly well known thing today but we still saw significant I'm not doing this well so when the user put that casa and the credit card failed and if you've got this in your you should check it out is it doing the right thing right in this example here is not doing the right thing the use is left with this keyboard and they don't have any way of getting the right keyboard up not you know not usually they they hit the number key I have and then they'll get that the keyboard with the numbers that along the top as opposed to designing that appropriately and once the castle  send that bringing out the  they  numeric keyboard for them  said the little things like this all these little things on forms ready ida and just checking out your form design in this way is  really helpful for people  so we've got information on specifying input method type and the and the correct ski boat that you can find at this link  then lastly let's look at usability and comprehension these at those small things that you can do that we saw in our studies throughout the act throughout the apt to make a more seamless experience for uses it can be critical for in showing a good user experience and not having uses get stop all abandoned that experience at any point  this one's about providing text labels and visual keys to clarify visual information so we saw this idea in my story I was specifically missing a visual key I just needed that is waits in the picture to help me understand the orientation of the hotel  take a look at this example here  just take a couple of moments and decide for yourself what you think those icons represent  some of them for obvious another us to have a look at the answers  Hey we guys so it's my trips  book  club to an account did anyone get them right  I think that probably accounts wasn't too bad  but the lesson he yeah that we saw it again I think it's over generalizing you know it's like the role that we would gave is that when when I comes a vague then they definitely need tax labels the trouble is that in saying you know when I come to Vegas we all have different levels of understanding with regard that you have to I think assume that a lot of your icons are gonna be bay I can give you an example say you know the the  I confer filter that looks kind of like this  and you think that would be fairly universal it's joining quite different ways across many different apps and we said he didn't find it universally understood among people so I think we have to you know change all kind of level set with regard to which you know the number of icons and items that need to have labels if people again and stand and this is a very great place where you can do simple A. B. testing and see the difference between between providing labels and not providing labels  Hey we've got some implementation details for when you want to use text and icons for buttons if you have that that  and then talking of labeling things that always makes me aware of making my application accessible  we have lots of guidelines here for you to make sure your application is accessible  I  the last fence about I'm gonna go into today is asking for permission sing context  so this is something that we enabled with android M. but we seals still see that significant number of apps on making advantage of it is being able to you Abby possible and I went for a while now as well so in this example the user has just downloaded and open the app and then immediately asked can that location be used say perhaps they sat out with suggested to them by somebody else they said no this is a really good app if you want to learn about him deco and go to medical things then you can buy  but it's kind of saying most similar to how we would think of problematic registration might when you offer that up front and it's a hurdle to get to get over this is the same thing for use as a slight that developers saying you know provide me with your location before I give you anything else right  and uses often gonna say no because they don't really understand why they just wanted to look nonchalant  says I'm a better way to do that and you can do that now because of android M. is  being out to do that in context at run time in this example we have people searching for a Stolz said much better because the user has their own motivation right they want to be able to find that stole and then what happens next is even more clear for them does a mat that comes up behind and a lousy asks come usually location but of course you can  right you're much more likely to get acceptance if you ask and context  we have lots of resources for you for  yes we have a great little videos and M. implementation details about being out to request to missions in one time and it simply in these principles because although you know I know many of you know about it we saw at all and in the apps that we studied recently saying  that's why it's him  said that brings me to the end of the principles I'm going to go through with you we've gone to each of these chapters in you can find more of these principles online that all online at think with Google  and I made a short length you have specifically to the principles back to mobile user experience  there's actually multiple sets of principles let me tell you what that is this mobile principles new set of twenty five mobile principles there's a new set of twenty five principles for V. tab that's both web and again we did a study and say we can say to the information provided that back and then there's the mobile web principles that  we publish previously that you might have already seen all at this late same link  and if you want more implementation details on the mobile website the principles are also part of our web fundamentals  site and that particular link I provided with you that provides that additional developer implementation details  before I go I want to tell you about one more story from the study  so in this study and number  after the implemented the ability to scan your credit card in order to pay now we've got a few people in the study that had to use that for full and come across it and liked it but because this is a relatively new technology we had some people that I encountered that for the first time now if you think about the way scan  my most familiar experience I think with the wet Scott is when I get to the place to be dole and scanned my credit card right and I'm I'm putting my credit card right next old putting it through it another machine ready that's scanning another another place I know if the word scam is you know putting  pay for the fed Cup yeah that's kind of a little further longer again but still not scanning putting something on top of each other said the users come to this that request to scan my credit card they that's their use of the word scan if you imagine them trying to translate that but often the first thing this office can we use your camera and well is a comer anything to do with scanning my credit card well maybe I don't really understand it but yeah okay you can use my camera and then it asks you to hold the credit card hit was scion automatically okay following the instructions no surprise then we still three people in the study do this  and they waited and they way it's it  and they were terribly disappointed because they thought it sounded so you know simple way to pay  and this is just about as understanding what we're asking people to do and that  language  using it's plain and simple usability we don't love this to work fortunate doesn't work yet  but it makes sense right what they were doing because of what what they're being told today  so again I would tend to that point I made earlier which is understanding the user experience and to and understanding the flow and the pain points really important because I want you to have an experience where you know  you make a really good to  after experience for your uses not one where the use of his fifth straight kid and not the kind of frustration I felt like after I'd use my after going up to my hotel room and seen that capo account to my windows  I want you to be out to make happy experiences that make people feel like life is really frictionless much more like a view of the beach and so I want to end with giving you three take away  and these are  three steps that you can think about doing after they stole  taking a look at your act and auditing your act against the twenty five principles simply like whenever we do it what are we doing in each of these experiences and and is it measuring up  that's going to get you a long long way but your app is unique to right so you have to really understand your key use the Janice  and understand there's break down points what I'd been provided for my hotel I was you know really exciting to me but I had points that break down for me such that it didn't end up working out well in the end  and then finally thinking about doing your own user testing  and this guide from Google ventures and provides lots of resources for getting getting going for use it use to be such an user testing in a really small scale way so that you can see the good things that you provide in the Appan celebrate that is and also identified the pain points in your right so you can think about how to fix them thank you for your time  \",\n",
       " \"all right I think we are getting  start with  so  welcome welcome to our first of fire side live chat to the disease the new format that the we are trying out in collaboration with you weeks light  and the city's form and we want to interview you weeks experts from all over the world and  look under the hood off their daily practice and hopefully get some insights how other people from the industry are conducting their business and getting results  so I am Centro I'm from testing time and and I will be your host today  and joining me Lisa  and SO testing time is a Europe wide that test use recruitment service with the pool of over a hundred eighty thousand test users and on our platform testing time dot com you can go online to find your target group and will provide you with the matching study participants within forty eight hours and we are doing this them fireside chat in collaboration with the week's life so use live fees  you X. conference series which she's positions are at the intersection off design research and and technology and the next event is actually going to be in two weeks on the October twenty fifth and twenty six in London so if you do not have a ticket that turns you are in London I want to go to London you can go to  you exclude dash life dot C. O. and get one over there and our first speaker in the final set set series Easter Lisa Marie Ortega and she will also be speaking at the U. X. life will take a little bit into that  for doing the interview   welcome re do you want to tell our audience today who you are and what your role ace and your backgrounds so that  hi everyone my name's Lisa  I'm from Manchester in the U. K. and I run a business call keep usable say where a multi award winning unix agency we help clients to and improve their sales impure conversion  to create experiences that are more in line with use need so we do a lot of research and a lot design within that process and one of our specialisms is psychology in behave yet so what I'm speaking about your ex live in a couple of weeks is about psychology and how we can use that to and to make our user experience is more in line with because too many so that we can compare the mines customize and so can be doing a lot of interesting stuff around understanding how people buying why they buying what we can do to combat the means customers  thank you very Nestle  Lisa Marie yeah movies my  all right so you mention actually before were chatting  before we came at all to the web in our if you had twenty years of U. X. experience can you tell us a little bit about that  yes there is my twentieth on the first day of being in you axe lead to a about a couple of weeks ago is when I first went to university and  so how I got into you acts that might be interesting to people tonight is Sam I originally went to university I studied computing in psychology and as an undergraduate degree on bad back then twenty years ago you couldn't get a job fifteen this two without having a must is so unpleasant I have to go back and do a masters at which ended in human factors in economics and immediately got to jump office not so it really worked and I started my community mobile I'll so I started at Sony Ericsson which counts not fines so you and yet these things that really popular nowadays back then wouldn't they were old business buttons and but that's why south since I started to say you at a usability specialists because you X. didn't exist at the time and I my role is basically as an an internal point of contact for any usability questions point to contact the designers to get some expertise  end user license that designs to make them more user centric  and  I could get to the log research as well so long research because you miss used to follow them down cover does what you how to use mobile fighting looking over the shoulders and because we didn't have things like that so this is a this is a Mister talking and that we use in Europe but while testing so just say that that Mr top it said they didn't exist  and so we have to look at your people stole this and kind of see what they're doing to make notes the same time is really difficult them so you guys nowadays don't know how  you got it which my easy now  and then after this in your ex and  a yes at what she had to sign the bill social network and then and when that didn't take how we use and we try to keep it usable and and that was kind of an immediate success in Manchester arms just comes instances junk three the sire and some of the what we've done is being shown at ten Downing Street in London is when the world and being on TV talk about sets that yes we like sites and we look why did you  so you really are a **** also for professional view X. and and use the research  definitely don't see it on TV everyday  really  so you were you were just showing Mr tapi and you were mentioning to me before and that you are sitting in a very special room can you tell us about the room that you're sitting in the S. A. O. and we actually create says hang you at club and so what we want is his day was bring together the benefits of ethnographic research so ethnographic is where you go into researching people's cuttings so you're in that environment it has high research religiosity and because people behave long natural and allow you to tell you what I think can and because they're not constrained by the environment and also you know when you're doing loch research it has benefits in the stake holders watching in the next all so the more engaged in the research they feel like the morning team that the user and demo allow it to take those insights away actually act on them I think anyway and so we wanted to bring those to solve  violence to get that we thought might was the best way to do that that's to create a homely environment that gives you the so the maker of the lab environment but with the clue fits in relaxation of the hind sight you and when we create sell out we also went away from the window coach so a lot doesn't have a long way nana and so I'll just show you it quickly so that you can understand what it's like  you can see we've got so homely wallpaper we've got an a front door as well safe I just a you can as quickly  you'll stay out too it's like infant does well and on the outside we will pay post it looks like a house when you coming into it and then we got comfy Chas and fluffy carpet so I just think in the text as well on that one I'm sorry I'm such a desk and  I see one of our users created this lovely book for us as well with paper folding cited bring us presents occasionally and I can  so the idea is the am people coming comments sorry let me just get this set up again and so people come in and it just beats all expectations because they come in expecting an office environment quite a full movie full setup and straight away it just relaxes them you know they got a they often clinic  while was expecting this is the crazy and homely and and then straight way they can relax as well they do have to worry about the cameras as well so we use little cameras and light you can sing with Mr topic here  it's quite a small town and said just got point  down over the side they just to get back to it strikes me and so we really put a lot of thought into the environment it's not just about how you conduct research it's about means on when you come to in as well so I could be the best research in Wellesley from putting someone in environment when you don't feel comfortable enough to come right up to me and tell me that on these thoughts and opinions and that's really what one Steve because conducting research is all about psychology in understanding you know what's really going on in the thought process and understanding the concerns and fears at what the anxious about getting them to tell us about those things which is quite difficult if someone doesn't feel comfortable  can you very interesting can you tell us a bit more in detail about how does it look like when a participant comes into the office what do you do how do you make them feel comfortable do you offer them something to drink what how how does it look like and next to the  actually we need in the lab is next to our front door so we didn't want them we didn't want to will consider an office because straight to where you know they see people saw that asks it will start to intimidate them they'll start to think about the people that work at the company so we try to get them into the research room as quickly as possible and so they don't have the interaction they don't believe in St cold is  I yeah I offer them a drink make sure they don't fully on yeah equipment and the give me a few snacks to eat as well depending on the time of day and sometimes do evening research  it's in the evening will get them there I will give them pieces three since I'm just make sure that that comfortable well looked after and sometimes we put a bit of background music on as well just to get away from that deadly silence that you can sometimes got  and so you know we just think of things to do really to make them feel at home in the week even out that these candles that we house the senses as well see walking to the ring you get someone I stands as well you just little touches lie about communing make a difference to people  and it's also about the experience off the test user right and so thinking about the experience also test user during the whole  user test and have you seen the differences in results  since you opened the homeland well the reason I built it originally was because I had some bad experiences with women a lapse so you   you know sometimes you get passes pent Hey you well I mean one person we had and we literally have to stop the session early because she she heard people several through the one way mirror on the light came on accidentally at one point so you could actually see the people in the other very  oh god it was awful so we we we left it yeah we stop the session early in and sent her time and she was petrified you know I really didn't matter what I do doesn't mean that she's trying to lock that she just come by that point and so yeah I mean the other thing about when when there is is that you've got to think of the observation experiences while so nice I five spoken about the the participants experience but also you know you want stakeholders to have a  the great day out to the office you want let's go white with ideas and damned if you put people in a DA creating that they're gonna fall asleep you know doing this nice warm without reading and they're not going to talk to each other you that because what you find is because they can see the person really clearly on this if you're the site America they tend to list them all and if you get away from nine you have a sound to shrink this is this is how  and they can not to just talk with each other and it almost becomes a workshop day our what a convenient stick the user interface designs on the green and when they listen to the user feedback I can and scrolling joy of ideas and they can talk they can allow fino fuses the something funny productive worry about not left and  and then you have natural daylight in the being as well so we now observation natural daylight sorrow at which I get away from putting people in the top three means that we even have created lighting in that as well so you cannot see it just the main just having so you get out of it and a red line each if you want people to a device that fits your bronze or you want people to feel more passionate than though I don't agree I did better and we can stick with glee that's nice calming color any six top bands but yeah which will any you can see twenty observational how does that set up look like so you you records the screen and the face and then  half that on a separate screen in a provisional that yeah exactly so we were streaming through your live video feeds a note here saying what's going on here and say thanks to all sorry to keep stay close concentration of what people are doing sire  and with a local youth with a woman a level you'll find is that the the tension is directed to the mirror on what's going on each huge you know people want to watch the user and the research on the of the site and then your user interface and interaction say for example with mobile oil is on the small screen in the corner of the ring and so people looking through the the Mira and they should actually be looking at the U. R. I. E. I'm sorry  the the positive at this is that we we concentrate people's attention on the user interface because that's what we also ahead for you know it's about user experience and their interaction with digital platforms side because the trade the state calls attention on not and what people are saying and then they can see them as well but that secondary you know we've got it set at that's the second G. tensions is drawn said actual persons  yeah we we thought about all the little details insult yes I can see that  I am so when we tracked back a little bit so when you are and you know you you  the discipline has sat down and  is ready for the test and can you tell us a little bit about sort of how you start an interview or user tests and also maybe some about as some ideas and tips about into new techniques that you use  I carries sorrow  I always think you know if you think from a person's perspective they call men's they may have never done research before they don't know what to expect and then a little bit with the fact that so it's nice just to to some general chit chat you know about the weather  and about what they've done in the weekend just to just to relax them and you know just spent five minutes on the  and then start with an office that you do have some things you need to do you like confidentiality phones non disclosure forms and consent forms and so just make sure you got out of the way as well and and the if they've got any questions you found those as well on then I tend to start with just some general questions around the scene with the research so stop quite wrote and then narrowed down into smaller areas Iran and then move on to the digital and farm so I'll stop quite often now on digital just as a one to one chat with them and then we'll we'll drilling deeper and then in my kitchen tasks to do and I might get into right those tasks  and always keep questions are you as well so you never want to be asking closed questions when you do research you was once be keeping keeping I questions and also follow up with your questions a lot as well so I I I see a lot of research is I'll ask a question the participant will answer and then they'll move on to the next question was actually they could have tied to the ends of a bit more just to get to the deeper levels of understanding you can really get behind the psychology as well and so sometimes people will tell you announce that and I see that the real on set is under the why away from that so you just need to ask in the why on top of it and you get to the true answer and so he's got to straighten if you if you watch someone do an interview and they don't asking why questions or how questions  I didn't say a surface yeah yeah questions that allow you to just dig a little deeper behind the surface on so they give you to the true reasons is fine now reading Chastain  interesting so how do you I mean you do you done probably hundreds of abuse the tests  during the past  how do you sort of Ellen  larger research project we sort of more off the lien iterative user testing approach especially if you are embedded in a  product team and you you are sort of rolling with the spring how do you how do you sort of balance those two  well I guess is a research and you always have to decide what the best method is so you would and you get that was as an agency for instance so will come to us and we have to ascertain if they tell me says before if  if this is the first time house enough that comes with the with the mailbox is this the first time they've done any research on that  in which case we need to look at a bigger piece with more uses  couple you know one hour sessions where you can get deeper into it getting coffee most tasks have more conversation with them or is it a test in the past and it's just  maybe is part of the design process where they just want some quick intuitive testing to feeding three in which case for conceptual to sessions with up to go his date it could be more feasible see past  and it could be where we just feed back there believe out the marketing report so that you can get really quick findings back to the design team  the trees you know on the same day even  so I guess yeah the method that you choose is very dependent on on the problem that you're trying to sell and you know what your hypotheses office solving that problem and so yeah it's never as a one size fits all which is why research is quite interesting you know the approach you take you know you might want to do some eye tracking on something for instance if you want to create a face so you Kamal boxes or the hassle of user testing   you've got a website where you're looking at fine tuning the conversions fine tuning the design conversion and get more people to buy then you might want to do so my truck in just to see what's come ten people using what I not use an iron which text today reading this is which text of the note read in and what date indecisive about know whether the eyes flicking between two things you can see it as a problem that they why they being indecisive what is it that you could do to improve don make that decision easier for them and so yeah this then as a lot of different things out that and yeah it's good to to the things will involve different methods and techniques and then you pick and choose and from your tool kit what's best to approach that problem that you're you're being asked to solve  and hot what how do you sink on that user research sort of evolved over the past years and what do you think will sort of seem more or less   in the in the future  how's it really over over the years I mean I I  in an eight twenty is  and the basics of the same really nice psychology was still other thing will have to really understand how people thank you note I'm because without save time as well I've seen people's interaction change they what type of the is and in a row at one point he was laying themselves as well when I tried to do use the task people just playing themselves if they did something wrong that is definitely turns now people will blame the software blame the company you know if I cannot use the group's website I'll bling boot was before with the playing myself does definitely changed massively and people more weather usability Morrow is a term as well ease of use them all wet of things needing to be easy arms that that comes up a lot more and technology we've go a bit better with so you know the I. truck is now we can really nice glasses that have really things writings quite nicely people's last so they're not as conscious about wearing them you know they can forget about them at that mall and I think someone if if there any sort of develop is watching this I think we could do you mean them some software that would be great Qasem  I mean I've used everything everything T. records usability tests and then  you know I still end up going back to Maggie and I eat so clunky an old now and   but it is reliable it never let me down where is all the software has let me down and said yeah I'd be great if someone could set design a something funky cool a month in that region that we can use to test with  and I did I was on  question isn't  well there are few questions already from the audience as well Ekaterina asks what sort of equipment do you use them in general  in addition to Mister Tapp be software and hardware to you have some  I mean you just mentioned one software do you do you sort of always trying new things or do you sort of keep two year olds to stick I'm I probably used to try more things  for now though I tend to stick with Mariah bit more now and what we use things like quick telling and still look back we used to use until it stops supporting and if they stop developing it and  okay with other things as well and contagious for instance  you can do and Google hang outs you could too and me moments software like go to meeting and you come across from Knox as well and zooms quite good so she wants to do and mobile testing well you're not too bothered about closing the sink amazement and it seems quite good from remote motivated research  I mean  hardware wineries an we use macs or we use windows computers you can use whatever mobile also watching what I quite like to do is get people to determine that I'm device with them so we'll get in spring that I'm  bile and Styx Mr talking I've read on that and you get a finger movements as well as what's on the  screen and so that's quite important as well as just seeing where people will going to fast and they didn't quite fast so you know if something didn't work on the screen and they they get past that you can see the frustration whether doing this and they get more noise in that size and so  that's really interesting to say as well  but yeah we don't have fun bickering cameras so you might expect with is having a lot that we would have you know the big clunky cameras on the ceiling now my experience with those is that you get the tops of people's heads so what we did was we carry with the small account sure yet because the I'm using at the moment so because myself but said I'm you know just small  small  what comes a high definition of the hasty cameras they have drooling over here on them as well that's all you need I'm in if you're just starting out just invest in these a Logitech HD cameras and another early and you know you got really good  you know these women really well get really high quality definition and so yeah you don't always have to spend a lot on these big cameras on the wall where you get the tops of people's heads you can get the monthly and just sat on the desk pointed nope you can get really good close ups of people spice that way as well  well thanks for that tool roundup let's I think very interesting always for people to see motivated document views as well so we've got to and you've got a document viewable I find the quality and not know as good as this so I tend to get back to this column  thank you  well almost at the end of  the well financed  let's cover  so maybe one thing and you will have and talk at you weeks life and in a couple weeks I  so can you tell us a bit more about what you'll be covering there and why you sort of chose the topic why it's a current topic but you  so I'm speaking about you X. psychology and the reason is that psychology is fundamental to user experience and I think it's got a little bit overlooked and look first to the styling to these days you know people are coming into the U. X. may be into U. X. design and that then maybe just changing from a different role they've not necessarily being Jean vesti instead of competing psychology like I did so and it's something that is really   Soltis experience no it user experience has the has uses in the titles I mean you know it's all about understanding uses its understanding people and how they think and how they behave so is really crucial to learn about it really helps you to design things that are going to resonate with people engage with them and and be more effective so my took up there quite a few things in my talk so I'm just gonna refers to the bullet points that I put down but basically we're going to try and  I can understand why people buy and we're gonna understand how the body I'm gonna go through some of the famous principles out that this way you shin and how we can use persuasion principles in design to come that people in check  Hey you get back to it and we're going to look at the value of psychology in you axe and yet savings that you can apply to your work so you can be able to go away from my session with things today and  just a little tip for anyone out there going to exercise my session I actually did this last year as well so they invited me back to doing the workshop this year and but last year it sold  the ticket that the spaces on my workshop when immediately within about ten minutes so if you want to go to my work shop just make sure you get in that quick that's my biggest emendation and will also can look at how you call that user insights and use those transform your designs and yeah and how do you persuade and influence people through designs that would bring in the psychology into the design site I'm looking at how we can make people do what we want them today  in a nice way  S.  so everyone who is at U. X. live should definitely check out Lisa's session and presentation and workshop  and so to sort of finish things off before the queue in a final question do you have some favorite books or online resources tools you already mentioned  that sort of  appeal to your knowledge over time and that  you you use in a record on a regular basis maybe and as a reference material actually there is one I forgotten to bring in and my favorite book is gross psychology so called psychology is by a guy  his first name's Richard price and but that took me all the way through university and I've still got my copy now in its got coffee stains on it it's got your dump stains on from where I put it on the window sill universe today  it's really well used I love it and I'm not just near my in depth psychology book and bull if you don't want to go read of massive book like this take  idle symbols are digestible books for you and say view sixteen in the wall is really good as a starting point for people and he wants games you axe and H. is really nicely written this loss of visuals in as well photographs and things it'll tell you how to do research to give you some tips for design as well and is really good if you if you don't really have anyone else in your company that does you axe this will be your best friend basically I'm and then I've got a couple from season one shank cues inspired me really and to focus on psychology within you acts I find psychology fascinating and Susan's books again you can see that quite then so the quite nice to read our site this one is called near what design  I need to say is just lo serve  well lots of highlights as well for me as I've been to rest and  but she again everything is just really digestible and this one hundred things list you know you can just pick a   one of the things is really is really not just independent ourselves just to refresh yourself so you tell all about psychology and are you apply psychology to you X.  and yeah I think that my favorite ones Susan's definitely worth following had locus well she sheds a law of academic and findings as well so the latest academic research that you can apply to U. acts just keep keep with that with what's going on  all right thank you very much you welcome them so  let's  jump into the queue in a two three questions  I think we have time for that so Catharina asks if a company just starts doing user research and there's only one person responsible for user research what would you recommend to do mobile  remote the already holding off the book read book  that's what you what was the book called again and the user experience team of one okay good doesn't hold  Dan Michael as once you have your research how do you package your findings to make it easier to hand off to designers or do you make design changes yourself  so it depends I rent some projects we do design changes which is a pretty easy  so that means that means the researcher can sit together with the designer and constantly gives my in Paul and the sister designs as well and also apply that level of psychology to the designs as well so the designs that we produce on just you X. designs that goal that level of persuasion in them as well we're always thinking about you know even just the words you use you know how to even had a few exciting and it's called  rising apply to you at some way you can actually and reflects the way that people say things and describe things back into the copy of your website and that will really resonate with people engage with them so just doing little things like that can make a big difference and if we're doing the research and hunting able to design team and we will create a report the findings not the stuff that you do you nasty Sir we don't we don't write long text reports that no one reads Christmas I bought in and we do things are visual so taking screen shots and annotating those who is really easy for design it's a got to look at a page and go buy these with the findings this is what I need today  and I and also creating a highlight video works really well as well say just as a as a reminder for anyone he went to the research and they just want a quick ten minute reminder of what the main findings were and and also the stake holders that couldn't attend the research it's a nice way just to understand what went on during the day and will use the side without having to watch eight hours of video  and say yeah I think sending things really visually helps especially designed this because that they tend to be visual people are but it's all about you know communicates in in a way that he call and we'll be able to get from not what they need is on that side  and yeah if it's designed as he could visual screen shots not lots a tax to be succinct evidence and I was wells  and you know  are the user quite  in that the backup your recommendation as well cook the fines in  zero always evidencing with that with the research  all right last question from Lina  who do use the chance to be part of usability testing and  that's why  at  question on top and how do you eat as sort of in most and product management developers etcetera  and  I always think the more people involved the better ands and actually what I love today is because it can be difficult to get everyone out of the office and into the research lab for the day we actually rely to stream it back to the office and so what we encourage people still respect meeting ring back at the office and the string the research and not being and it can be like a shopping day for people and you find that more people will attend it that way so you will get the cost of money just popping in and even CEOs we'd have popping in just to see what's happening because they're always interested to hear what customers say about that other  and so I find that works well with hearts and people dialing in as well so  as well as streaming into meeting back in the office you can also send out dialing link and then people can be working from home and dialing and they can be doing the work at the same time site that way that not feeling that feeling guilty for taking time away from work and although it's nice if they can do that if they can just take it day out to to engage with the user research you know sometimes they just calm  they can decide the desktop that has tons in like this and they can be listening to the research as they're doing the work at least is going in some things going into that had and you know that that that in spirit study room  so yeah I would think the more people you can get what she says asset because it just it affects the whole company effects the whole business you know we haven't seen your who's making that major business decisions based on the results of our research that we do is not just about the time team it is much wider than not you know the more that you can learn about your customers just the whole back to your business will be in the most successful you'll be at the end of the day  so M. apart from making making it easily accessible during live sessions or OR live streams and so forth how how do you approach alter departments and and sort of make it  and how do you  sort of convinced them to to to take part what are sort of goods arguments because I think a lot of people are struggling with that  well I when I you I tell you when I worked as an Ericsson why did was that I I befriended people so you know just going to speak to people and maybe doing some presentations internally to different teams and if you can talk in that language as well don't talk in the language if user experience and and things that they're not gonna understands chines speaking in terms that they will understand and you know that will make them see the benefits according to  what are you doing that job so how will this research help you and your team to be active in the most successful so talk on that level with them and if it's developers in pieces always works you know if you if you say no you want to get developers to coming up if you reset say that we're gonna have some pieces we can make into a bit of a phone session and I did a beatnik creative in that area don't be too formal and don't be too pushy you know people will rebel against that if you're too pushy with them and always trying to be helpful and   yeah make it say the eight benefits them to contact you and to get your expertise and advice and make yourself approachable and then  yeah I mean sometimes you see people in that they are quite full sites in their views and  China imposed on the company because they feel really strongly about you acts and I get the I. you in our police to be that person that room for you but then you realize that the way to persuade and influence people is to speak on the level that will and engage more with them so to speak that language and some of the things that we doing in user experience now speaking the uses language speakers stake holders on Christian  pull together is a great getting the money all signed and maybe doing some exercises to  and highlight the benefits of using research and listening to the customer in Boston the benefit since transferring those insights into the design and what the end that will be in the best business decisions that they'll be able to mate Kansas  and yet that will end up with them and get in that promotion because that would be most successful you know effectively how you're helping them is and then some of these people in town right  and the beating about the embassy you have towards your co workers rights and and sort of how you can help them yeah yeah don't go in there you know all guns blazing unit you must listen to the customize the right thing to do is you may not make friends that way even though it is the right thing to do a real nice and so be it talks will be this way he said it may be helpful  shadow things as well as you know the more that you can share with others and you have the marketing team I got so we found these insights that you might find useful in your project might help you if you want discuss them let's arrange a meeting with you  fit together and so being helpful rather than too pushy with people can also help  get people on your sites as well because the the more people you get on your site and that will and you know they become your ambassadors also they'll tell the people in my teens so if you can just make some good friends  some can come toxin and not spread the words as well  right thanks a lot for your all your insights  and I'm sure our audience learned a lot from your wise words and from all of your experience that you have in the field of you ex so where can people connect with you  last winter or  yeah I have everything inside  a if you search for Lisa maybe I'll tell you that  I'm on Instagram Twitter and we have our blog keep usable as well and so you can

we'll see you at the next fight yet  thank you  thanks bye everyone by thanks let's see the  \",\n",
       " \"this call for will call on you with my opinion  design if you tip and invited us basically to get you and we are sitting in the  his ability Latin yep amazing live he's great Adams yes first of all just introduce yourself sure sure yeah  so like you said my name is mark and me and this is our usability lab welcome this is where we test all the humans in use even try to figure out what what they love or hate about you too  so I've been a designer you should know about two years okay and prior to that I had a start up called flick yeah and  school decided to acquire flick in our team and that's kinda brought me brought me here  I worked on all parties to rest on the player road we worked on the redesigned last year  currently I'm working on TV and some cool stuff with iPad and iPhone so yeah that's kind of what I do cool  so you mentioned that you were up for you you should not to yes but you also work for start ups  what do you think it's like the biggest difference where I'd like you to buy everything you do  as such a big impact like has such a  huge user base like to like it's not awakened build everything from space like how you want it right yeah I think this is it this is this is an interesting problem for designer I think a lot of designers want this  depends what kind of person you are there some folks so when I get  I get a blank wall skin in my hands I get X.  I love this I love the idea of starting from scratch in creating whatever I want and as a start up you can do that you can see a need and you can build something from scratch I can open up photo shop at in in this is actually one of my core strength I'm very good at imagining new apps new ways of doing things okay and so coming to you too we Google itself has very intuitive process almost iterate your way out of a steak if you make a mistake no problem with just an array of out of it in one of the challenges we have is the design work we do here are small changes in overtime those small changes add up to something very very big very huge but  like you said because of our large user bases we have to really we can't just like tomorrow we couldn't change all of you to search for example if we said all right when you type in the query for lady Gaga all of a sudden we totally change the results we do a big grid view and we do something or maybe we just are playing a lady Gaga video I don't know like we can't do that right because we have these sticks that our users are dependent on you to turn around five or six years now Google search of course has laid out some very kind of best practices for search you type something in you kind of expect you know kind of a title link that'll in description you in in a kind of linear way and that that designates order and so you know we have these debates of like what happens if we put search resort result was on all and we bring him into a lot like this and we do not tracking study turns out we do things was on  you you can watch people's eyes they just go crazy because there's no order they  don't know is this result the best one or the second is the best one in so for something like search for you to search  as we make changes to that they're very small on the very subtle you know maybe we had duration to a thumbnail see you know how long that will be in turns out duration helps like if you're looking for music video you can be like oh that video that is twenty minutes long that's probably not the music video but this one the three minute that's probably it will play with the size of the title or shrink it down allowed in the description or maybe some other metadata and so as as a designer when you have those kind of constraints there's   some joy in that but there's also some frustration as you just want you want something dynamic and rich and beautiful and I think the other problem that designers have is this idea of ego like you feel like you need to solve all the world's problems and so sometimes  sometimes it incremental changes doesn't feel like you're making a big enough then in the universe and  but you are you have to kind of take a step back in and realize you know that small change for example we made a change on our player we get to the end of a of a video we we used to have one two or maybe three videos we change that about sums sometime last year we went to just a big red of videos and turns out our users love that a lot more choice it especially if you're in full screen yet ten of a video you how you can see a lot of the related videos that are up next and that drove a lot of engagement I was a really good thing and up it is a small thing takes it took half a second to design it in Photoshop but made a big impact and so anyway so it so start up is better he's not  better it's just different it's it's very engaging and rich arm but it's it but you know when your product his maturity like used to the different kind of designed solely in what interests me is like for you to be you don't have to like  Dr use this to you to sign up yep them all kind of  so we have now we do we have the challenges right like how do we get people to use our I owe our iOS app how do we get people to use we have we have you to bond PlayStation three how do we get you just use that it's the same challenge just like on a massive scale yeah but is this do you think this is a design challenge  a use it is experience challenge I think so yeah I think so I think a lot of it depends on so take our iOS app for example yeah you know how do we how do we let users know that when they go to iOS six they need to get you to back up on there so you know we run we have if you I don't know if you've got an dot YouTube dot com which is our mobile web experience we'll put a banner at the top okay by the way we have an iOS app that you might want to download the to better engagement so we do the same we have to do the same kind of things everybody does forwarding we see we have a marketing team that spent a lot of time cracking our messages you know buying advertisement using our same tools to come get the message out we're not we're not immune to you know the the rules of marketing getting getting of what's out there I think I thought like competitors yeah actually competitor is in informs in terms of the I. O. S. six need you at yeah I later things coming up there there's a look good  there's  so many cool one of the one one of the great things but you too because you know we have this wonderful ecosystem of developers who are making beautiful  kind of like the the the take the take are you too baby on the bill beautiful they like their show you an and dragon tape there's all these really cool interesting mash ups that they do I mean there's one that I have for my kids called we will end and all it is is they've just curated like kid videos so it's really safe it's like super safe you to for my   I mean you seems pretty safe but not like for like a four year old yeah so you know it's funny because the design is so so but the experience is really great I can no I just tell my son we don't go to you tube go over here to this little out by having his iPad in it and I know he's not gonna get some crazy you know gone gone style  Nicki Minaj made some other crazy thing not no offense I love gun guns Stalin making me not big fans and not for my four year old little bit too much  so so that's great like I love seeing that  seen people innovate there  when we designed it you too we have a broad we're designing for the world you have to you know we have to design for the cat video that we have to design for the protester  over in Egypt and we have to design for the the Khan academy's people who try to change road of education that we have to design for I don't know breaking bad or some TV show or so it's that's really challenging to create a platform that can handle any video of for any purpose you can't you can't be a reverent you can't be too serious you  happy you can almost have to get the heck out of the way in that the video really shine so  if you just mentioned innovation  and I just saw today like then you eBay a design came up and  I think stumble upon as well they all at this interests silent now that all in the masonry the big yellow phone what do you think about that like yeah thank you copy cat a lot because it it looks like you people like it they can just as you like people of it so we copy it and it's like basic myspace myspace through the new myspace also Pinterest so so I think what people I don't know I think they could the confusion is the the reason people love Pinterest yeah is because it allows individuals to create collections in the show those collections and when I share my collection of really cool maybe I have a collection of really beautiful book covers and if I know that our Pinterest I share it with you and and then I get feedback from you know like to thank you so much have such an inspiration you kind of stroking my ego there so I think one other folks clone the you why they kind of are forgetting so free day for example I think it's great that they've now with everything out big beautiful pictures I think pictures art communicate so much more than a title camp however what I'm looking for you know I I can't you know five D. canon camera specifically I search in an  I mean they're just different parts your brain I'm I may see a whole bunch of SLRs I mean to be honest like I don't know enough about can't miss it does distinguished that's the five D. that the sun  in the that's the Nikon I just don't know I'm not that hard core of the camera do you and so I need like the title and stuff and to be Frank when you do a big mystery lay out on eBay you you limit the number of results you can have by the fold I mean truly when you have like this and so I don't know in which one of those is the most important so if I search for something on eBay and returns everything a big red how do I know what is most relevant they're kind of during that line a little bit so I love for this that is so beautiful like I'm I mean for me yeah like killer like this is out of a hole in  it's for a browser discovery experience I don't quite know what I want I think a great works really well but I think what we've learned is when you want something specific I think lists work much better okay  in in like even I don't know if you've used the new  when you search for apps on your I phone now it's just like a big tile okay have you seen this thank you new market store so yeah you go to the apps store you search for the U. to you about to download it and it's just a big tile then you have to swipe might get another one yeah you swipe the unknown well  I think is beautiful and is from a visual design aspect I think it's much better but did I was want to list like give me like ten at a time on the screen I was want to scan in so when a tentative time I can scan a lot faster than light giant big blocks  so do you know they're straight officer and so I think  as a designer you have to be very honest with yourself on when you're putting crap in just a poor crop in this beautiful it's like when you learn how to do a drop shadow in Photoshop you like say  quicken loans flared up this so killer and like  no date is terrible like you don't need to make everything look like interest  you mentioned inspiration we talked about interest yeah  where you get inspiration from you have do you have like like blogs magazines are like you just go outside yeah I know I have a bunch of random blogs I got a like blood sweat vector or not caught a try to go to places that other people don't go I don't look I try not to look in trouble because I think because there's so much good well the problem is okay drivel I feel like really bad about myself is amazing because I was like I stock like I said I'm old actually get out of the business these kids like eighteen years old like I just put this is redesigned all of you to be in an hour and like all your you should have my job here awesome  I will I I have a lot like I like to look back like a lot of these old that the graph books from the eighteen hundreds like  I don't know I just try to go different places and look for look in outside of our outside is I mean you know you can get like monocle on there's all these cool different design magazines you can got there are cool but then I think what happens you just end up regurgitating we all we get we all can up copy each other and then I can exceed know everyone has this like skew more fake everything looks like leather and has stitching with fabric on top of it and it's like all right find like we're done like we'll do they get that out of your system we got to move on man  I don't know the next thing is in like you I like I don't know if it's flat and sharp corners I don't I don't really know to be interesting to see what happens with action was actually an expression like yeah what is Z. and  translate I see a lot of transit photography you know people are doing these big large cover photos the blurry bad the blurry photo thing that that path kind of started you know give a lot of credit to those guys for like even the cover photo type thing and then it's it's funny because when when Facebook or Google or any of us when when we do things in design and they tend to push some trends so Facebook went to these big cover photos  you know we have those on Google plus now the big cover photos  I mean you to use with doing branding for a long time ID voicemail do big background behind so like YouTube and Twitter you can do big background behind our channel to kind of give you some some branding I so I don't know it'll be interesting to see what the next kind of evolution of things I think will be I think we're going to everyone's going very minimalist like windows eight is cow that metro style I see a lot of that kind of emerging  you know we were talking a medium a little bit before the interview that's like large topography big foot big photos simple  everything's ready touch friendly I think people are stuck in no I think you were realizing you can't rely on hover anymore you have to really kind of think mobile first MA one million people sell time think mobile first but what does that really mean thing that really needs cleaning all the crap out of your app in just going with the most you distill it down to what you really need so I love I love you know I love big beautiful topography I love photos I I love good content it's funny like people try to take good design in and have that be a substitute for good contact but we have beautiful pictures and in great writing like how much designed  really need on the anyway diverging a little bit of a god   well my last question would be like you have any  tips to people that's not a usability lab like yeah I have all these things here the amazing  I guess for start ups of people just want to test their new ideas  there like ways to do that very cheaply  also like quality feedback yeah you know last night we you know we had we had that event  cool we had an event that  Boston's Irish together and Jake nap talk last night he had some great tips it was using users them do very quick usability studies one of the examples he shared  that I thought was fantastic was he set up a thing where he would show your site each a one mock for five seconds ten seconds then would go away they need ask user the users and what does that website do another was awesome like I never thought even do that and I think of your start up I mean  I think you take Iraq in you just show it to people knowing someone this he put in from what what do you think this does and  so yeah that's a great thing you can do I think the second thing you can do is is use your app you can get even here you see we get to I don't know that I used the particular things I work on for you too every single day I think if I did I'd start to see a lot more problems and fixes I tend to rely on our user studies outside world so I would say you know use that app as much as you can  in in a start up typically you have like the founder using it all the time but maybe not the whole team  so that's really   other things that are interesting for me is  five I don't think you I like dribbles interesting because you put something up there to get all sorts of opinions I think you need one or two close friends that can give you like some unbiased feedback they're not they're not me like  that's so cool you're awesome no I tell me how terrible the person I am and how terrible this design is in tell me you don't understand it don't try to act like you get it understand so you know good friends like you guys interviewed Erin yeah like I would show some to Erin any day there and be like that's terrible war that's amazing and he would be able to tell me why and and and I do would also because you have that trust with with someone like Erin  your data birds another person I could take something to an end  he there Dave they're able to take your friendship and just compartmentalize it that that's over here let's talk design this doesn't work and these are the reasons why  and I don't know I think the other the other itching to steal another thing from Jake's talk  in worse we do this here you to two people use keynote to do said you  interactive mocks there's also I've use proto proto dot I. L. which I think is an awesome site you can upload a bunch of  assets not mocked assets and then just like in Photoshop you keep him on a layer and you sign in different actions and then you can then you can basically it'll build a little mini out for you in your phone then you can take around you can swipe and do all that kind of thing so there's and there's a whole bunch of other tools coming out for mock building whatever that I think are awesome you know and I I would use all those things and get him in the  friends hands and just use the crap out of it if you got and then you're my wife  bless her heart she she arm she's not terribly tactical but **** but you know she's always a good a good test for me  just because she's she's a mom she's in a hurry and so  she super smart but she doesn't want to deal with things so it's good to show her things and if she doesn't understand interface frustrate service like what this with my time I don't use it so that's my Pinterest worked so well for her it's you know there's an extension she's on a site she loves you hit the thing is done and there's not there's a lot to that my daughter is fascinating she gave her an I phone and and there's this trend where she doesn't tax our friends to take a video of herself into like Hey how's it going dad us Merrin and hope you're doing good send  and then she and I'm like and I answer that why are you doing this thing that text typing is stupid takes way too much time like what I even want to do that that's a that's a waste of time I can hit a button and talk and send it in so turn off her friends are just videos back and forth it's it's crazy it's interesting so  you with the information age were super impatient they want things right now we're tired of working and we just want to we just want things really fast and so I I you know we've compress the time line to do a start up you get a designer again engineer together you can make it and the P. really fast but that's all getting compressible press compressed so I think I don't know man I think you share your thing with somebody and they're like oh that's cool you sock you fail okay that's not good enough I ask what is this  you know you have to be honest with yourself to kind of  Arafat that feedback cool my humble opinion I don't know it's like we have a lake sorry so much if they great it was great slowly thanks for having us yeah I know anytime was great up yes and  I say by and see you next that  \",\n",
       " \"action okay sure so I'd like to talk about your business idea today that you have  I know a little bit about it from the research that I've done before this interview but it's always good to hear about it  in your own words so that I can fully understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish makes sense  first off could you explain in your own words what this project is  well yeah this project is called blockbuster move it's a business that I developed  it's essentially a way for young people to develop like high scale theme parties  with a planner so it's kind of like  you know like a personal fitness trainer something somebody's gonna maximize your workout will maximize your party and we do see matic parties based on sales  we provide that content  activities so on and so forth cool that sounds great and what's your role with this project did you conceptualize this idea conceptualize it and I sort of have final say on one ships and what we actually decide on for for content which movies we DO essentially the CEO of a team of people that work with your correct  we're going to create a website  for this project yeah yeah we want to be able to have a strong web presence and reach as many possible clients as we can so  sounds good who is this product for and what do you see your key demographic being  well the way we conceive of it is this product is for younger people who   when I have an active social experience but are maybe not as inclined to go out into the world so maybe young parents or people are into controlling their party experience their environment  but also the nerd demographic you know young people who enjoy content  and you want to sort of incorporate that into their social behavior so we're thinking you know   mid twenties to forties because you know  the nerd age is getting older and older but   yeah just anyone who is looking to have  interactive and Larry S. party  great  would you define a success for this website rework presence if we could sponsor and launch  you know  ten to fifteen parties within the next  five months we'd be reconsidered that success is just a matter of building our client base getting the word out there about what we do and   you know closing some deals made some sales great and do you imagine that with a good web presence and with referral and word of mouth that your business will continue to go from there what do you see as success in the future for you two years down the road  yeah well I think I think our business will grow based on word of mouth I think that's the kind of thing  that  lends itself well to this kind of business because people have an experience and they want to share you know that's the whole deal with the party it's like you cultivate a social experience documents when you share it so I think  social media will provide sort of a    support role serve a specific unseating role to what we do on this website to the packages that we provide for people and in two years time we love to upscale to larger venues to large groups of people may be you know interact with businesses office parties things like that we're definitely willing to expand as of now the stock we provide in the scale is is more of a personalized trip domestic product but we love to expand and do more serious work   yeah you really the numbers will will show it like out however many clients we have what we sell as long as were increasing in revenue to this yeah satisfactory percentile from  from quarter to quarter then I think we need to change great  your biggest worries when it comes to this project specifically that site and your web presence well execution is everything so if we put something online  online that we want people to engage with and the party goes poorly because the website doesn't provide an accurate depiction of what we do  that it's all going to crash and burn because of a lot of what we're relying on a social media sharing word of mouth so it's really important we make it clear what our mission is and what we actually do I don't want people thinking they're going to have you know  Marty McFly show up to their house and  having backed the teacher party I want them to understand the parameters of what we do know what to expect  so it needs to be flashing exciting but so realistic and reasonable so or we're not trying to  push your product that we don't actually fall through so there is a danger there it's kind of a bouncing  yeah it sounds like you are pretty focused on the social media component of it would you like that to be part of your website as well or would you be  we can figure out how to do that clicking corporate whatever you want but I think it's important to bring interactive elements to the website and is that something you'd be interested in absolutely absolutely I think as many social media platforms as we can  tied to our product you know the more the better  yeah because I think a lot of it like I said is it is going to be about just the social all   the social energy around the product itself and how it propagates on its own  once it's in the hands of the consumer so if we can connect to social media through our website that's fantastic  what are you thinking about a time line for this project and I know when thinking about  time lines and functionality both are important if you could pick one  is it more important that we get a grip a good website out there for you so that you have a web presence or is it more important that we focus on really getting all of those pieces of the website functioning well before we watch well I think I would rather have something that people can go check it out sooner rather than later if there if you can send you to be worked out down the line some development flies I would rather get the product out there even if the  the nature of the delivery system is in perfect so that people can start party as were all about about people having  the time and having the means to have a good time and being the facilitator of that you know and parties are  spontaneous and exciting and they're supposed to be energy so as long as the product is there an is available I think  server working out the Kinks as we go is certainly acceptable  I'm excited about this idea I want it to happen quickly the quicker the better is how I look at great well thank you for meeting with me today I think I have information to start working on this and we can meet  throughout the course of the project I'm looking forward to working with you  thank you  \",\n",
       " \"hello how are you  my name is a class  report of the team here and there is a lack of seven people around you   so I hope it's not so much in to be the first time I'm not a musician  so I really don't know about your product except that I sort of  and I was very lost  I don't even know how you write music  so you were going to a school so  now and it's very interesting from my point of view    but we will discuss  but the discussions are I have to follow some process of questions so  it's the first time I do these kind of interviews usually I make is directly with clients and face as   so  why you participated decided to participate these projects  which was initiated by two months right  what was your motivation  yes the thing cost tied up to all the phone so put a bullet meant I started to trip for next school program  also my project until two months later  wasn't will fix  well for use of the software project in his song big up must climb  all  I started to suffer projector because I'm an engineer on the list simply curious  whole  this colonel so filled with books and I went to trial and if I could to make it work  okay so I see that you have keyboards behind you so your musician as well  no so it's a private hobby so  well if you played  yeah okay but you live it you like it really like it and it's so cool sometime a plate in a in a in a couple of bands on some musical soul   years ago  yeah yes ago so I'm still making music the slow fronts so  your product there is a lot of them  they usually  just seeing them in part  so too are you located in in clock yes we are all in Prague here all  see  check friends sure  your from the do not carry out right  India  check  Russian and okay as a skinnies  the world is listening  so basically today so you are an engineer and golden to project   your musician as well if you don't qualify like that that would say yes a composer right  not really a composer but let's say you're a jazz musician  in the sense that  all try to improvisations  all music yes  well the consistent so  compose up  I don't know my compositions  do you do you find this tool useful today as it is  do you  yes yeah  and the and the  for which reason how how actually you think that to improve it  yeah the  the program itself  so for me it was finished  many years ago and then I tried this proof of concept on this concept work I lost interest in the  stop making this program also let alone I started again on it so basically give the law the positive feedback I get from users worldwide so keep me working on this project  okay so you're very aware day about the the feedback of your customers  yes I think so yes  and what is your  kind of analysis like a basic  five points which actually treat your interest and also  to your customers faithful to your tool and expecting more  yeah it's the basic idea tool tool to all work on something useful for the people and and and which I expect that make it to Dave more useful or will be more your school or your customer  yeah also owns every musician every instrument at musicians are playing all requiring a special two months on location  for the developing of this program means all to get it  to make it more useful to more people  that's one one aspect of the next expect expect your working on making it easier to create schools  well known on two sides on one side for beginners to the simple things make simple things even simpler and on the other side to  for more professional results for publishers will actually producing all school books with the program although it's a difficult thing I believe  okay for white design tool all two very special features of big enough  you don't understand what the meaning on this for the future of this  all the   yeah  a good good question when you open the application ones like in school or playing  that's what  it was like overwhelmed by all these menus last ride on the talk show  I'm not  yeah rex not I'll  got some musical someone said try this program even if you're not a musician and even you could kind of treat us because it's just looking interesting   so if it's playing a  and so on so you  just click on the graphic point some  and that some people where  enjoying these kind of impression of leading oldest technical arts or it was like a disappointment so I'll how they perceive it   most people  lecture program all along to all like the like it because it can produce music in enough possibly and listen to their own music so  it's even more interesting for children are so the school was children world using of this program and that could  compose something so moving notes around on on on the screen went immediately aren't they could listen to the school office  I'm the best they could give it a title also own choice  you mean titling the music  music goes a name okay that's interesting  related so that the process of really creating something  okay  so  that he's being will belong to them  yeah and it was  interaction with several students or just like indeed your in front of each software  all  to the class so I salute children bottlenecks eight twelve years old I guess up sitting in front of a computer up until many computers in the classroom and everyone could  trial  so you witness  I saw a video of the sword was on  okay we can find this video on your trip  yeah maybe I don't know about the  Tomas knows this is collecting all this kind of stuff  it is very important to know when we do it's it's interesting to  so what I  we are very oriented the regarding the customer so as much as we know it or the user more exactly  as much as we know how much as we can  it's useful for them and  making  it was successful  so today the application is really a leader on the market right   yeah it's one of the leaders in the market I think  because of its for free all of course in a bondage tool the market leaders to noise so the Beatles and phenolic  to be a system  from Great Britain munching on is on display United States I think company was doing this   home that would be a new program from Steinberg Germany I guess and   on Christmas day one tool all the ****  so the three programs of the commercial once  new school  I think it's so yeah it's one of them okay signature will rank  number three  let's say you have  so you are very aware about your  computers ranks is it because of the deadlock mines which are on line and as you I will I will you can predict  these information launch  yeah more or less it's it's not not  my part of the story it's more almost box who wasn't supporting the long lists of the commercial part  I'm interesting of course these programs all Melissa reference products if there's something in question  you can look at these programs and we'll call they did it was a soft this kind of problems to use we have  okay so this is very important that you actually pull up the carefully the  the complete teachers and you got do you are you inspired by what they do or are you deciding okay we we knew something original it what is your your kind of decision regarding the developments which feature you  oriented your your   improvements yeah first so that's smart decision hold onto sole things up on the sofa part but for future through all be helpful  we could all use a response we have phone up a feature request lists on this kind of stuff under huge forum was slow to reach thousands of entries okay well requesting  so they are voting for the best  feature  is that right  yeah wall to solve the  democratic it some way soul someone else to implement it to do it and of the one we implement features decides what he  of course  Hans is so you're going to use to do your laundry how how do you decide like the  which feature would be going  for us is because it is easy or  how much it's it's not small not of difficult to explain the technical part in in  implementing all this kind of stuff  from things are easy to implement some features of the things that were difficult to assess the future was the fit and look clone the structure we have in the Sofia and it's so it's difficult to do  then it's likely to be postponed some all  so for those three things it's okay yeah due to implement  but difficult in psalm may require a restructuring data structure and so on and the little so slow also for the very expensive phone tall time consuming  it's like you are changing all the basic structures to destroy all the features the group  up to sing you backs and so on make it unstable  okay and  what are those features that actually  you think they are like the core elements of  use core  and  and this  double or  yeah yeah the goal of a single slot to prove he was so good looking school also that the layout of an immense it's a basic tee off the program  organizing oranges on visual elements you see ought it internally in the program in a way to produce one looking all put so though how it's going to stay single for notes  this kind of stuff  all what we are currently doing a song   doing more automatic email team all things you can imagine the Tom some elements in the score can collide if you have or know what had slow buff below the stuff and it collides with slow tempo markings and this kind of stuff  and we are trying to automatically place just moments doing collision detection  this call stuff dishes because your customers asking for it or is it more like a technical aspects which will facilitate the functioning how how what how do you justify these  the simple  because from now on  two things first it so it makes the producing the squall easier and faster  of the normal process is that you are a minority adjusting elements and now it's automatic so we can produce scores faster  best looking the schools maybe you which  all this requires some fun to  but  good enough looking schools  yeah yeah using of the though core mission isms one of the product for the sophomore one school of you well on smartphones and tablets and  on on a technique to be are we we arrange local school off the so that they fit on the screen  this is quite a step to Molson's up  automatically  because this fine tuning a without us up groups only if he's bringing that sale on a for the performance and you are adjusting sings to look right on them fix it before what what on a mobile device   screen size is a different view of me arranging the squall dynamic kindly and have to do all this automatic  so in the end to the whole room I tried to develop along the lease tool of but I'm looking more for a true but I'm looking more by that  two regarding the developers  which are participating on the get up how do you structure the team you are leading the decisions  armed   Sloan just wait a few helpful central repository off the source code for the monster loan program  you see it on other people can look at the source code and can at all features by contributing court of this court those are presented as a so called  request for all people  I understand the coke from my point of view because I'm not a deadlock or myself is just a question of the structure how actually when you implemented feature or technology part of the software  how do you justify the development and who is in the team because those are based in the community   do you  hello hello hello asus working do you are you does the one which is like the final points saying okay would go for these  and we implemented    just so I can go it is two people who decide to so it's me and it's  Nicholas all I have right to exist to do smarter repositories so can make changes Nicolas can make changes and I believe you have full two or three of the people of developers from the community who can also right off the strip the Tory because you trust them to not make bad since all of  and those people are musician as well   I'm just  yeah lay music will create  yes yeah owned this also could pull requests to be a deciding on  some from the community  some from Nicholas some from need all this is also discussed in the community solo forum open to members yeah three open with so many  development and everybody come come look at it and can all discuss it  so  some things are really at all decided to  from the community because I'm I'm not this is the bottom users from London can decide to order with the Turks ahead don't have the knowledge to know how to do this  so you need to use the veto the part of the song  you know so development decisions  and there is someone who actually went  and he makes  he doesn't like I mean that was like a moderating this community like sustaining a  did not make a  process of development is yes it's not moderated a little it's really open everybody come now can contribute to the discussion  but in the in the  the decision was made by me  Nicholas  simply because I'm the one we have to implement more things and Nicholas thus implementing things  well yeah insist so your trend will be from more the technical point of view more about the future point of view   bos  so some features are easy to implement  so it's it's easy to decide on the future of difficult and expensive to implement  well  more discussion expensive in terms  right yes no  all these resources are limited of course  you  couples  sorry there is some  it is  we are in the library of the university so it's like  announcements like at the airport   but the the room of work is very nice here  ins  so   I am looking at the the questions here   are you so you the the according to what that we discuss about it before you mentioned that the kids which are like  very interested in getting on board very fast and  making something   illegal results as they do computer classes at is it related with music as well or how are our a  actually these  interaction with the software is happening as it is in our computer classes  it's a wonderful open music lesson some all  okay so they did tend to learn music and in the same time using the the software  you know so  yeah they're playing with a soul fulfill some more but  two softwares so  very nice to to learn music of course because of the of the immediate feedback you get it through Aug drive down location shoots gets immediate feedback  Levick  and how the teacher is  actually  how do we know this software how he actually interviews the software just kids you know about it no more would you  also in the special thing about this is so the the age of the children arm normally your arm if you're in a music school so you would think of this kind of program  program so they are about twenty Ole Ole  at the time in really read music schools windows putting down all but about  home this just kind of people are because you learn on this call mostly  so there was this part of creativity  we have the four  where we work we would like to know what it is it's about the variation  that you are about to release the next year and as you are like this technical person which is having decisions  the implementation of the features    do you think that  actually are there is a way to implement song are  haven't you weeks or interface with in the process of rationing  before the  make the final release of the version three  or if you have a expectation to work with the unix that will will double up afterwards  to understand right tool  boom the development of for you all right  yeah   I  sellers so how do you see your action within the process of development  yeah there too two Bucks first home grown the Wiest's all strongly coupled into the in the mission itself the program that was very hard to change if you see from a design point the whole so it's not the psalm changeable  it's very expensive to change that's the basic you why entering notes look the the note entry more to have  cool all the keyboard to the malls actions if your  your moving in men's Roland on this graphical all come us   next to the sauce from you I elements or which operate to synthesize all of those so configuration of the program all editing a star is and and this kind of stuff all the psalm so much easier to change   let's see one awful W. why the Nancy cone behalf of I don't like it so the mixer  it's in the median XL bed was CEO a little four slides and not slow to change the volume off for every instruments in your score  well this is so cool internal mechanics  and I'm responsible for implementing the saw misconduct hold this could work to do so the look and feel of the interface saw yeah it's completely arbitrary  currently  and     so you you follow very well the the user feedback as you said at the beginning  the the day satisfaction  and   do you for a new look a fuse a few call home feature across from your votes for the  what to what to do with salt of the software I'm interesting in though in though let's call the virtual representing if someone's also won this all that future it's not interesting but it's of the user experience  why he wants to  hefty's future on and the context it is you was armed then you get a better feeling how to implement it  also   sometimes it's not good to Oscar he was also a whole the one to see this or that future implementors  all  to own it at some point you have to make it all  yeah I do have to make  work until  explain all my English is not the best   someone  sometimes there are conflicts  so if you implement one feature you destroy another future  of two features do not fit together come out implement both  although a conflict since implementation  it's from the  from the technical point of view or enough of the technical point of view with soul from the dementor Asian   sometime song    you also develop us you see all ordered the special cases on normal use that does not see a normal user doesn't see his single problem  it's a developer you have to make it conflict freebies or special cases which are  a call  but I want only the simple of future inserting an old and shifting or north to the rights and the mental  say mom but what should happen if the goal is to plug on a can of movies over a bottle of wine or the special cases    yeah how would you see the collaboration between   I will research the results of the research and your technical expertise  regarding the development day you are in the process of implementing on the database  how how  do you actually   she  this collaboration  the collaboration this with the re charging the result that we're going to do in order to  closer you weeks  with you and with the other stakeholder  yes so  I'm grateful for everything put it all on them from let's say you're from all  design perspective flow hole you see the service so you I program on how you want to sort of put on  it's it's my program us only a limited service also some hole so I'm completely free you all will sings a done looked all or  all too well    things change the more this  if you  okay  some people something so it's easier to change of things the more difficult to change didn't know having  you are mentioning the fact of changing but in practice  our intention is to make an evolution and an adaptation so  our interest or I will collaboration is about trying to implement a better experience from the user according to the data and the information that you have  so     we want to know actually the actual way to process which is happening with one side your user  knowledge and on the other side the devil Chris capacity which is representing by you so  the question is really importance because it gives you know  Scoble how  the freedom or the the way you actually decide on the process of implementing the ex is a very precise questions are how you see the collaboration   saying we can change everything is very  large and it doesn't  hello selection process reduces I will repeat the question because in a formal way you have a lot of constraints and we need to know is constraints in a more detailed way  maybe we can repeat the question in a time  but will be coming out  if we go for research that will not be possible to implement I placed  and in terms of not change but an evolution  do you think that it's about adding features do you think that this is about    less features but implementing them progressively  how a house like  the   six process of implementing new  evolution in the actual   products gone me next year   yeah    Michael install tool  reduce future smallest would really like to reduce future as well in the sense that I want to make a  Altman R. O. feature set oh sure adults to use our    things he wants to do with the purpose of  would be to at special features fall special needs and adding one more one more  earned my believe us sol  the less stressful future of the program house you tool tool  tool easier it is to use  so every very special feature for coal you the Arbil  we could use over the long haul so usability fall for normal use a small as well  that's that's difficult to war tool also not say to political us on one's a pragmatic approach and that's a special problem  at a special button to solve this problem of that so let's say you're though denials Philadelphia all through the program can only make things of a trip to slow descent which is designed in of though unix Kotak I can from the unix so it  up to provide a subtle force more towards roots can be combined some whole  in the end you can make sense of the program but just not all designed in from the beginning  so it's more flexible and all and so on   though implementation is based on this automotive settle future three half so if the feature requests from also add to all change requests we want to change something and it fits into this autopen on sept all features which is implemented then it's easy to do but if it does not fit done it's a problem  you'll have to change it you know control flow flows so filled them  bill get complicated  so there is two fellows of fear mongers chat  if I understand what you mentioned before there's two philosophy in the way they are Nicola and  you are actually collaborating even though it's the same product and the technical  our background is different so therefore you change    no features are different priorities  how does it work  between you and Nikola  maybe on mall   exaggerating a little bit this problem all but in the end home or do you do with so to confirm this  all the compliments sol because of the limited resources we often  so  mostly a pragmatic approaches saw required to do things  people to do something the slopes of software  in two do you have a already plans older different features that going to be implemented aggression three or is still a flexible process how   process for me also   for me you know some more or less so continuous development of the product by adding new features and   if I have to implement a future withdrew because some  change of the inner workings of the program the new Bill  last long well  get back to a more stable version  your country is also in the end he believes this is version three dot goal  there is a specific reason how how how is the evolution is that like  three suddenly in three weeks there is like two three developers supervised by you which I like implementing  new features and then sent me one months  wait for something bad or  structure regarding the solution  the engine three  nope this glorious start  so   well we have some  project system all this a defined goal which   were implemented by someone else earned more finished  for instance although good some of the project we did this young auto three students all cool implemented some special features  so they made a proposal  multiple to do on this proposal was discussed in the community earns a thought developing  does not finished on most things or work sold Saul is gone for good you make all the growth  I don't know there's this big red design soccer we have gone to you both automatic placement model for women's school  yeah it's just so cool feature  flew off the next big Russian  to the students Isshin as well   I'm not necessarily  model I believe  or maybe will be most essence what's gonna  so for us to have to be  see plus plus program all schools  yes  discrimination  for a musician  program  so  well this well combination  okay   yes one contributor lists all just **** to mark's about to the phones and welcome to states all new  does really all program in see plus plus  all  can program works but it's an exception  do you communicate a lot about your products of manga musician or more in the community tool developers which  actually you have  what is interesting is to know how you get the feedback and from who is it more from the users like from the position or is there something that low purse which are actually suggesting features and would work on me I have a hard time to understand the way you manage this community on one side the musicians are on the devil curbside  can you explain me yes  both  people who are active on the forums musicians or hoping magicians all  single switching in in the core  this kind of stuff   musicians and some people all actually producing and publishing the schools with the program  you are so  sorting these communities yeah those of some of the soul be musicians so  it's wall contributing court so but not that much people  so  yeah  okay so all  well we can have these data later  will use is   so it's it's a little not feedback from program a small school  how do you see a   successful  shin tree like to increase your audience or is it  to target but  your audience or to fool Christians some part of your audience  yes the flu kind of thinking is more Thomas like  so I'll go in and do use H. of of the of the application yeah  but it's not the buys my thinking was thinking it's it's an interesting technical problem  I tried to sort of  okay so this technical challenges yes yes yeah okay working wrists  busier costs  to  to get the old lan and collision detection for busy across both the next things or try to take a  okay  so in thinking willful use us and making though the order so you also confirm your reaching with this product  begun and so on did the deadlock or community you follow the most do you yeah I'm  I'm over in this list of bug reports you have fear for many many many old book reports on future Chris or this kind of stuff yes  tell you every day you actually do you do you'll every day  go for what's going on today at the  community or every week it's a regular  process war  so I'm I'm not fooling the community on a retro law basis  locked in a systematic way all Nicholas this expected this I believe is foreign community you very closely so present in the chat rooms and  does most of the communication  unity even on the technical point of view and the users point of view  yes yeah so it's one of my my post  deficiency all do not communicate enough on so maybe I'll  autistic or whatever  well if you like mathematics is for   yes we almost  ending their interview and we'll have  questions people and yet sometimes   so   it's very interesting your point of view up  so the version three you would see the success from a technical point of view making the  application most simple or every  that's more sophisticated forward so it's more so   yeah makes the best program available all of it  be one of my in my in my goals  and do you do you see some problem that you're going to actually  soul not be an aberration tree  a major   you shoot at the extreme you have seen progressing from version one from the searching to actually depression tree clicked  chief for the future distance big goal of for automatic placement of elements and collision detection you did not help version two currently  you have already feedback from people who will try to actually uses version three   all very positive feedback from people would like it to what's going on so you are testing   I'll stop there shin regarding these yeah also  if you'd like you can mount can see every day progressed so by using the nightly build up of producing will ever change I do on a daily basis law    gets in to the latest conversion  and everybody controlled  so daily in date gumballs on a daily basis all be how from all ocean for windows users for unix most you have to go but it just sort of put  also for mac users the booking  controlled  okay  all   synchronized with the fact that they will be on different devices as you mentioned before  yes yeah  and it  most of the users are using the version on this dog one on the hand held the more bile or  what's more  so for creating school  home the musical programmers also used on the desktop  and for playback call for user on this kind of stuff so all you do some water that way you can get schools  okay SO three cheese forty five minutes there will be  open questions from the attendance here  I think ideas and or go through all the questions once simple stratosphere  I I will be there and then  so when we could rotate  if you don't have any questions  so thank you man at  the  he's going to ask which yes we do not  so I'm just gonna let nine the others  ask questions and then I'm gonna have some questions my own and wrap up  so  yeah so that's going to strictly having she  no  computer  okay  have any  I'm thinking about  yeah you can  I have one question my name under  so in you mention you have some core features you want to wait them understand right you want some questions just  the main disco  right  user can use futures and add them  a week about their goal is yes the desktop phone new school all all program  so yeah  all  I don't think I understand what what would you want to see that it desktop program  you said there are so many features you won't  you want to use them as well like delete them all  yeah known actually don't want to do you delete the future up all I mean I want to  minimize the to the  to you all right more this tool  by future a if you're single awful  able to produce some kind of full school also all would reduce this  but just to be able to produce  kind of course I want to do this because the minimal set off for of buttons and    it would be even better if you saw who you are a could be reduced to some simple not too few of concepts  well into the condo some concert told to you to use so you are and if you  be able to reduce the number of call  to be easier to amend a true   for normal guy tool  appraisal fell it's easier to memorize all things will work whole  someone could to chief of special effect  all too many people  cannot find hold hold to do this to do lead to measure all something like that all    I believe for all if in the background there are very few will offer concepts it would be easier to operate to stock up on the th of some jerk so kind of for you why design I want to think about  well not a ball hold call buttons but how many buttons and are they really necessary can this be made different and easy out  that's what I mean by reducing futures  what  thank  okay  it will   right now  warm  all right so I have a few questions are asked and then I'll wrap up  first I want to ask about your expectations what do you expect from this design    yeah better user experience for a full for you the  and it's it's really difficult ought to rule on because we have this this broad range of views of all  starting from from children  hello  playing with the flow of the program  show want to have some positive feedback on the low side view how flow of professional musicians withdrawal sometimes computer illiterate  and our job sometimes all I lost some old  the devoted to something  people who are looking for a button to or did you just call from the computer out the whole can ideally I can create a school that's it but I cannot do needed for how can I do this and you have to explain them all use your operating system and financial to do this also Sophia  this kind of stuff  and  what kind of school do you imagine us to target well  do you expect us to   well what what would you expect what what how would you define the scope   efforts  yeah tool all    I don't know we are you what do I need to know you have to define this so that's what you want to put on it  what you want to talk to chief so are there any restrictions  hello  no  also restrictions of course  okay  is there a  is there something that that you prefer us not to focus on     okay  all right so we can focus on anything it's it's very open and I'll discuss   I understand correctly what is your greatest fear of  design effort failing  what are you most concerned about  about the design  yeah if you try to change  though  yeah well to all the if you try to do to change the underlying concept  he was then it sort of getting difficult for me   well what do you mean by and rally underlying concepts   yeah also all that's hard to do   to explain all  let's say you know what the input mode behalf so what if it's a more or if you want to introduce more molds or  we moved to smote all done it's it's difficult to rule  it is are you concerned because of the implementation issues or is there another reason why you're concerned more about women Tatian assurance and of the the whole thing is complex and  I I see problems with your change of this kind of stuff on yeah  I believe all the things we don't work anymore them so  good solution no doubt level  what would you  I would like to me he  make sure  about this question which is about dose if you have five key element that actually you could be a problem could you name them or describe them that could be actually I'm structuring the software which actually some dealers of the software what are they  no I can name them  totally also  maybe one    so it's a little bit upstart I think all  the whole  so   no I don't know external okay let me maybe there no restrictions so often which can be changed    just  I would like you to think about it you should have some idea about this because this is for me I think quite important to think about   because you mentioned them and then now it's like a  and the fine and it's the one aspects which can drive our development in one way or another I think there are going to be technical restrictions and if you burning and  and the  then that's fine all right now I think we'll run into them when you design  think of anything though   we appreciate hearing hearing it has   if so if you're looking to fill  thank you have a better way to do things all the other can discuss system refined audited saw global or not thank  yeah well always community you will  how how do you expect us to communicate how often would you like to communicate and how much  as much as slow necessary  but it's completely open source all the I used to  make this development completely open to all discussions of a public moreless  how involved would you like to be in the process are as little as possible okay  we don't want to make any any decision all of the design and end of the final thing  I believe  if I were a design I would design it and we're going to ask you about this  I want to delegate this tool people normal  doing and I like people can work all   what's cordial self contained some old school   much controllable to  all right  would you like us to focus on what what do you see this as a focus  all you have to call the house will solve this  the song this mix up problem all I don't know a whole two strokes is currently all the mics also simplifies up and the and and and all this stuff owns all bindles frequently have to operate so frail  is  is their work will or  AT is your is  search for  doesn't make it  like it's  all the connection is that I didn't get the last sentence   basically what what do you see as problematic areas  or  people that aren't being targeted that should be targeted  the target also from  I think I'm on the wrong person to also school I'm I'm this technical guy who doesn't condition   if you books that I'm I'm happy  but it's more for for all the people I think okay for for for the users  my technical problem of the P. R. contra using all the support Tyler was hassle fifty fold lines of code I want to drop it by the stem of Thailand Nicholas Dustin this is the last day is I'm  awful when  I'm sorry I I didn't hear you are did you say Nicholas doesn't want to the class implemented this already and also you can look up to the more this good install of so could we are using  end of year are open to all the salt Steinmetz  you can modify the look and feel awful for many elements from the outside but scripting without recompiling the sofa  also to experiment lives look and feel owned up yell for me most in the office of  basic style look very oddly  but that's nothing to  toward to discuss so  my likings or not I like to doc's son Nicholas lex Luthor lifestyle and the people say darkstar was depressing and awful and  yeah  kind of these discussions are  yeah yeah okay you mentioned argued audience  you mentioned that there is a large scope of people using this  children from children to professionals islands you music beginners   what do you see as a focus  user target target user issues  saw  student to music school I think  what is the question to  to ought to to muscle  is there a person that you feel like specifically doesn't fit   zero it is there a person that you were specifically not targeting  okay  Thomas Thomas of god and then  actually people  writing music or improvising on a target user and  the people who have to those already that it's it's more of a tool or  writing the music down rather than composition  yeah yeah would develop a point of view  I would like to more support all composers to add more features to make composing easier okay which is going to leave the country all small fault job producing scores for yup  do you   would you like and you score to be more focused on composing composition or markers on  no notation on a school writing or writer writing the music down  yeah it's it's full body music dawn the look the main reason reduces project fire but by easing compositional become law get people who call use all unknown to all people to write down delta compositions of both first using this call for this  the benefits would be  Kanab can listen to your compositions immediately and all come in all sorts of insulin  four normally your using and Jennifer this panel canceling people  going forward well what do you see as your main focuses with music or in general  my wife was on misquote  I know the focus of the  projects  how do you how do you expect the ball  yeah  what we're doing is some more ending up so it's a professional thought school are getting more proficient symbolic will  use the school  so all  yeah  ease of use for beginners  and to extend a loss like it's sort of difficult to do built over the salute both suck moreless okay  I need you expect those to ship more towards   digital display of of scores verses currently there is a more of a focus on on printed scores  all those calls  the  if you had to choose between   quick delivery and sorrow  throw design  process what would you choose what was more important to you  the darkness or a speed  well the little girl was okay  how do you how do you see what do you see as the role of Adam's going forward  well well you mean so you mentioned  thank you you preferred to have a very unique base give thanks Adams on to play a more major part going forward  for special needs  you know this could happen if this melodic approached by  raising more muted future storm role and also plugins all  no  okay  well what do you see as as the biggest hurdles that you had  in terms of design and user experience  all  I personally don't have any problems with some of the design for mere if it's working it's okay let's see other people have for many problems design  but  yeah it's it's  it's something  if there's some old people see this product  give them a  some people see it as a toy  that's something which saw its not so   reusable relief of because of the clumsy you look and feel  all the both the first version be how to log in log bindle slutty five location  so all Texas law  for you the three programs the toilet so the look and feel decides whole professional  this program  the little three year functionality the program us it's really important  there's so  I guess one last question ideally where would you expect to see the project in five years  that's a good question    yeah  it'll be better than love the market leaders currently  okay  that's a goal from the group put of to day and better in what ways  yeah this is up to a year about a half full but I features but a disability  easier to you with all the corn market  okay  want to have some commercial success of course so you know maybe  I commercial success as in our own making money  yes  okay are there that  are there any plans to make more money  well what are the current plans of of  making money from you all yes grow the userbase  okay   anyone have any questions  okay  do you know the the competitors rights do you owe me a little bit so I'm not using the vehicle selector are you using them laurel never the  I started with the Beatles was an old version of the Beatles I bought three for  six hundred  will be back at the time   CBS five hundred both soup to put a type of the product of the law I get some inspiration with this program  books  but then I never upgraded to and I don't have any fee not installed or go  I don't even have any windows computer at home  so this is  yeah and their inspiration was because the technical part of you is was easier to use or  well no it was a starting point  four of them show up medical something riches slot at school but all of them deals  because at the time of the best program available the most modern program  from from from  so for design  all you will see a reference for me  jock  I'm gonna maybe  room  repeat one one aspects which for me is I think it is important that you know   you mentioned that you would love to have these products or at least you would like to have these products local composer so they can create and not only writing this course is it the way I understand it  local composers let's see special features so to all of which Los  although the finished product in the more or  in terms of radio difficult to explain all the composer you start with the Middle melody line and you don't have any measures and don't have fall district requirements squall S. to start with a little new at this kind of stuff  composer wants to duplicate   seconds of notes from one instrument to a different instruments  more refined it in a special way   to break up controlled into several instruments and this kind of features so you don't need to fuel the simple right don't wanna mom existing piece of music   but if you all  composing for let's see it orchestra you'll constantly need this functionality  should show you your today you feel that's it  it fits your needs or you would like to have I mean personally and as a musician or as a composer as a jazz musician you feel at this location is satisfying your needs or you still think that  there is missing beasts and that  how do you feel is the main   are you part of the Stargate group that you were mentioning  which    from the whole music  listed in list some functionality arm  so you want to transcribe the music you will grow up playing a free  just just musician river water project owns the score the so very difficult because saw ohm  this call was an obstruction of full review music  played by musician what the exact timing  you play the notes can be written Dahlem  so the obstruction is to simply far or this  on a bottle   future through make this also simpler  we have gone to the song and and the needy in port section of your play an instrument instrument of let's say you've gone on record to somebody recording and put it into a new school arm there are some club also fell which underlies this media  fired and tries to fun olds of the main beach and all this stuff to make readable notation over to  okay   more features so calm necessary tool to make this easier  okay Susie if we can  more information by your guarding this  we'll be asleep  or  what you are you are the more precise where you're talking about these media and  systems which are most simple that you feel be translated in features so therefore   what our vision of the simplification that you have we need to and  standard be more  but that's the going to the I mean   you have a great day here and this like timelines for some people here so I ended up  so I basically   it was nice talking to you  I feel like we learned a lot about   how you perceive the soccer we're going to have a right up soon   and we'd like to stay in touch so are hopefully will do a lot more things publicly  going forward   the next phase is probably going to be use research when we talk to people and try to find  their work flow how they think about   certain things   yeah how you score could send what their goals are etcetera  and hopefully we'll do that in an open way and  use the community as much as possible  if you have ideas on how to use the community for user research that he appreciated the others so a lot of information birds deep into though  into the war database you could be half the forum so all your  okay little discussions we had in the past  okay maybe  I'll take a look  do you have anything you'd like to add    okay  then I think that's that's all  I will  yeah I'll keep in touch using email okay  okay I'll see you later then  \",\n",
       " \"hi this is Fred Simonsson and he is the general manager for victory tool in America Minnesota  so  stay were going to talk a little bit about  his project which is a new  website or revamp of the current website and  so first of all Fred tell me a little bit about your company what do they do tool bills metal stamping dies  metal stamping dies stamp all metal components for Connors  ATVs computers anything  that uses metal metal stamp components okay and how big is your company our company is has about twenty eight employees we the revenue is around sort of five million dollars a year okay  so we're gonna go through a couple questions just to gather some information and do a little bit of research  for our for this project  so the first question that I have for you is  well we know it's going to be a website  the website you currently have was tell me a little bit about that how did that come together well when we acquired the company at the first of the year  we we acquire some my company there was much larger and they had their own website that we were a division of souls  so once we split with that company we no longer had a web page out there yeah lower  we did that however we were lucky enough that the company that owns victory tool for multi source for victory told that have a website that they kept the domain name so victory tool dot com was still hours okay in so we quickly once we got the company going  every January first to quickly  John R. I. T. guy that we hired to help us with the I. T. stuff put together a quick website so that people that called it just a blank site okay  good I'm okay with that was that  some sort of reminder that even if it's going to be doing this interview right now  okay so  who is this website for where we designed this for over designing it to   to just have our name available out there so somebody is looking for  to own a company and they  they Google tool and die in Minnesota or you know or or if they see a seer acento trade show are  here bonus through word of mouth they can quit going take a look and see what we're all about see what our product is so it's essentially for customers of ours and are you thinking it's mostly for new customers or  existing customers are both I need you want the website   so let's say you're at a trade show you just want to be able to have something for people to go to to learn about your company yeah exactly primarily it will be for  new customers to learn about us  existing copper come customers  at least with how it's configured right now won't get anything out of it other than if they want to you know look at a quick  email address or something like that it's a class or something like that contact information or address stuff like that but this primarily for new customers so to take a look at our work product examples of our product and that kind of thing okay  so   for this what kind of business goals would you happen this website what would you like it to do my legs I'd like it to impress upon new customers  our quality   they like they like it too actually game help us to gain new customers so  we do every year we do an annual trade show this in different places across the country and that's where we get most of our generate most of our new business auto so they come a seer both legal are currently sweet their card or whatever and and then when they go back to their go back home no look us up on the on our website  and so we want to impress them and to help Miller them and so it's still a  no really it is to gain  gain more customers okay  and   how  is there anyone else that we need to talk to besides you for this project would we need to speak to your business partner or are there other people involved other stakeholders in your company that would want input on what would be in the website yeah I think would be a good idea to to talk about which  my business partner and  you know he I'm sure he would like to invest some ideas into it as well okay  great so we talked a little bit about who your customers are and who your users would be and  who do you think the biggest competitors are right now of yours and what are what worries you about them  our biggest competitors are not necessarily regional because  our product is sold throughout the country and in Canada   sort competitors are primarily yeah manufacturing hop it's like Michigan and Ohio all   Wisconsin  I it was so we we want to    want to be able to actually enter their markets their markets are much richer for our product so we're trying to actually enter those market places yeah and pull from  from what our competitors are already there are competitors have an advantage being close to the customers okay so we need   to have   not overcome that was quality increasing so word were targeting markets are already have some pretty serious competition  okay   so how do you at X. expect to differentiate what you  make are how is your product different than the other what makes you  that are you know why would I come to you as opposed to another  too and I can  our product is very high quality  the customers that we have that we've had for years many always have for many years come back to us because we've got a very high quality product and we saw for a good price  as I mentioned many of our customers are throughout the country  we've got customers in California could be buying dies from a lot closer to to California but they bind us because they're they're very impressed with our service our our quality so that that's  you know so that's that's the main thing we need to solve solar service and quality  to work  Somers so it sounds like those are the two biggest things that you want to differentiate from other companies that you have a good quality product and price is reasonable  so  using  few key words how would you want people to see your brain at besides those those two words and any other things you would use to describe your company  you know I think    key words  well quality   you know  are   lead time as far as how quickly we can  get the product  to our customer is is usually much better than our competitors are so   so narrowly high quality good service but quick service  and are your  I most the competitors are they larger than you did you say or are there well where would you fit into the grand scheme of things  in terms of size are you considered a small shop a medium size shop a large size shop I would say that we were worried probably an average size shop there are so much bigger shops and we are in those are some customers are really kind of going after Izzy's larger shops they tend to be more expensive  yeah  but  but there's there's also other shops are smaller than ours okay   let's see so we know now kind by customers buy products  from you over another competitor at the two main things that you mentioned the quality and the the price  so when you lose sales what are the most common  reasons   the most current rate Stojko common reasons are   could be  price even though I say there were competitive there's a there's a lot of companies that are always out there looking for something cheaper and you know so   we do compete with China so are  so that's where praise comes into play  China does provide a lower cost quality  lower costs tool but  typically the lead time is much longer notes where we can you know even though they might be a little cheaper  it to it's gonna come across the ocean so we could be a lot of the time so    so yeah so what things to customers complain about our ask for most often and why  the  or do they complain we don't play    you know usually it it could be  could be over price you know when we're trying to quote something you could say are yours to Heidi and we know what we work with our customers in the race   used there is very rare to ever have complained small quality that's it's pretty much are our highest answer would thank god   level primarily complaints are are use okay so  at the demographics of the people who would be using this website can you tell me a little bit about the potential users who are these  buyers are they   general managers of other companies or what are the rules of people who are actually going to be using the website to  Klay speaking it's it's tooling engineer so it's somebody within their company that  is very well very knowledgeable about metal stamping dies they probably work tool and die maker at one time or maybe it's a sign or whatever so you know the product very well  they're the ones that are usually always shopping for for diet builders soul  sometimes it'll be   purchasing manager or something like that that doesn't have that kind of background but their their job is is trying to find shops and then they'll send the engineers ought to check a so so so could be a variety of people primarily I would say merrily men or women or probably more men than women  the governor and across a woman that and what's what's the typical age group do you think  typical age your but  by the way since then and I did have a woman that used to buy dice from us okay  so what typical age group   it could be  a lot of our guys that have been in the business for awhile so could be people in their forties or fifties   so but sometimes younger okay   see I think I can't think of any other questions   right now I think this gives me a good idea good background of what what  sort of work that you do  are there any  let's see do you have any other questions about or any other insight you might want to give me about a company or what you might want to slip say to do for you yeah I think that in the future we you know typically are  it's safer to another company is just sort of a show and tell sort of thing  but in the future I think it would be a bad idea to have a P. like an information exchange because often times not office makes sense or not this is an idea but often times were sharing files or customer needs to access the diet is sign  for all we've been done for them see some kind of oral so that our  are are we need to they need a place to send files to for quality also maybe it could be a place for receiving calls what activity  in that kind of thing to where you know right now our requesting information  you know like what I see more information or some sort of a  feedback kind of a thing or any  current website does our email addresses on there and once in awhile we get  action from that but  I think it could be expanded at one point more than that and have you gotten much feedback on your website at how are people finding an early signing it from the trade shows that you do or are you telling them about it or  well we haven't had a trade show since we since we bought the company work or we're gonna be doing one in November actually so that that would be kind of when we would hope to have our  website revamp computers for the trade show  so November  because I meant to ask you what what the kind of time line we're looking at   let's see if they have any other questions arm  I think that might be it for now and we can talk later about what sort of ideas and things you might want on the website  I want to ask you how long is your company better run  can you give me to name is actually been around for about twenty five years  so  the original owners sold it in two thousand five tomatoes or something about it beginning of the year or so to really were we only owned it for about  seven or eight months now once great all right well thanks a lot for a for talking about your project and well thank you talking soon okay  alright  \",\n",
       " \"welcome to the myth the podcast I'm AT Simpson and this is where we took to design is a Google about life and the future of design  these episodes with J. one one of the U. X. design is working on a project fi Google's wireless data and phone service Jay and I took about the design decisions behind project by working as a designer with a computer science degree and much much more enough for me if you enjoy this episode of the method but cost  hi my name's Jay I'd seen on  the project by team since January this year and I've been a Google for four years in total what drew you to working on project fi  I'm I was really drawn to project fi because up until that point I'd worked on JI plus and hang outs and photos and I think a lot of the objective of those apps I to kind of like keep you in the apt and stay in the app and order the interaction is kind of just like with its contained to the act itself on the project fi is like a very interesting project because it's actually more services line rather than apt design so you sort of have control we have control over the entire lifecycle like the marketing website the checkout process the activation process the packaging of the sim cards in the phones when you get them so it's it's a larger design project with more deaths and breath yeah that's just like a lot of complexity  you're thinking about every end point and it it's much bigger than just like you X. design from an apt point of view and how is your process changed because of that I think you have a much you need to have much wider view like a high of a big of the birds eye view on like what's happening and you need to kind of like make  she always checking in on at different points because like certain things don't match like you con have complete consistency if you think about like a U. Y. way you always have the same like you I elements it's not exactly the same because there are so many different ways of interacting with this service and  I think it's in those cases because a service you need to have a much more clear idea of like for example the brand all the tone all your principles at a very high and more abstract level like we always want to be helpful witty confident   and I don't think that's as important when you're thinking about just like sort of an app but when you're thinking about a service with much more different kinds of design in the process it's been very helpful to have like an overarching overall feeling that you want to give these a  what is the hardest problem you think you're working on across all of that   there so many   I think that does a lot of complexity there are so many dimensions all of like states and also follow on project fight is also like lots of different uses so for example we have like a group plan   and it's not just like how you use this app but it's like you controlling everyone else everyone else and what they see and how you will interact with each other there like multiple flows that kind of require  like multiple handshakes basically in order to get anything done and that is really really complex because you want your Felicity like very simple and fast but ultimately there is some like necessary time stops  you know like just to put it in perspective we have  if  I check out process that's like eleven screens in total but the set of designs for that are over eighty five different screens because it can they can be like eighty five different outcomes honest it needs to seem so easy and so simple and it does like when people use our products like we get really good customer satisfaction a lot of feedback saying it's very simple very intuitive but honestly behind the scenes it is so complex like what's happening the decisions they are making affecting the why    and  sort of like  the amount of thought that's gone into hiding all of those is like  a lot of there's a lot of time that's gone into it when did you first realize you could be a designer   well I'm pretty sure that I have like websites and blogs from when I'm like twelve or eleven  about how I want to quit school and become a website to Lana yeah like legitimate lead they still exist online never telling anyone the Ural okay  did you have like a creative upbringing or your your parents into  liberal arts creative arts not all of them the real story is that I do remember this so clearly I was maybe like eight seven oh eight and I went to like my friend's house and she was older and she was like look this is really cool game cornea pets  now let me if that's what's bad and I want to like make all this money in my knee of head still and I like had this near that killed I wanted people to like join it and realize that  in order to do so I need might like store to stand out and it  to send out I need to like learn all this he's too Malon CSS to like make it all look good  and then I kind of like very quickly realized that actually the part I liked most was not really like anything to do with near pets but was just like  making  like using code to like make these beautiful things  and  I can I love this completely on my own with no like help at all   and in fact I remember not realizing this is like a really stupid story but  like  I will copy paste the U. R. L. like the the address of it like a local file locally into my code when I look at my computer like you'll grab an image it would look just fine  but then I would like going to my brother's computer  ghosts go to my friend's house and get a look at my website and then real and then I'll just get the image era  links for everything I it took me like a lot awhile I was like you know nine or something at the time to realize that actually like there's a complete different concept twin Lake local addresses an actual  upload images on the internet yeah   so I kind of  found my love of web design kind of from there and coding from there and then sort of started making my own websites million blogs main template it's  like forums and stuff and then  never looked back okay McConnell lead you into into web design and design itself  yeah I think it's funny because I started with web design first when a super young and I love technology but then I kind of as I got a bit older in high school I was then more interesting like photography and film and  graphic design I I wanted to like Saddam magazine and stuff and then  kinda like loop all the way around I went to design school for like a year and then was like okay actually I don't find  print that compelling anymore and I kind of really miss I miss like coding  which is why I went back and then decided to like pick up a second acrylic so I basically decided take a second major  so I was like double I did a double degree in design and computer science and yeah so I kind of did both because I just it was weird because I always knew I wanted to like make absolute make websites but like you go to computer science like you go and study computer science is very technical and it's like all out of rhythm bass and data structures which I loved but that isn't this like visceral   visceral feeling from like sing something visually that you create and then I felt like graphic design is so boring because it's so static and is no like fluidity or like there's like much less problem solving  I know you mean like the first time I built a website market interact with the pages and change pages I was done I was so hooked up yeah point of you like actually where is all the print design and have done when I was studying before it yet same feeling it felt very flat yeah exactly it's just like not as engaging and when you really create something in code and you see it in real life it's just like there's literally no other rush  in the world like that they creation aspect yeah   and like it's just not the same like making a mock  it's it's gonna gaze it's gonna be so far and it's like nice to see but it's just seeing it and interacting with something and like  being in Notting out a really difficult design problem like you X. problem is just so satisfying you integrate part is having a look into your process what benefits have you found from that  I'm I think  prototyping has like lots of different benefits I think there is many interactions especially in this day and age what is like a lot of motion and a lot of  feeling that you're trying to get that you literally Khan capture and static images arms and sometimes I also think it can be quick a prototype than to like make fifty marks of the same thing with a different balance that makes sense using is because you have a background in coding was if you didn't have the background and cutting it would still be quicker  I mean there's always a line there's a always a toss up because of course like they're something you get for free with coding which is like  being able to change one property and change them all thus having to do that same thing and there's a couple of things in skeptic symbols that kind of help you get there but it's definitely not as fluid as it is today like with code still   but I mean certainly yes I think prototyping is a lot easier for me because of my background and it comes more naturally to me and that's how I think but I think even high designer who does not have that strong a coding experience like  learning to code at the very least it forces you to get better as a designer because it's forcing you to think of everything as a system  right like every time you break a system now it's a more conscious decision of like yes I think this needs to be different  instead of like I think sometimes if you just always purchased from just a visual design you're much more likely to like bend your roles all like kind of  do something that's a little inconsistent because it like looks a little better in this instance when sometimes I think like that's not practical that's not how gets built    and yet it's not it's helping kind of regulate your designed to make sure it's like  working  consistently yeah I think that's a great point annex a company like Google which is engineering driven have you found that it's really help you sell your ideas to other stakeholders in your team  absolutely I honestly think that it's maybe one of the biggest like factors and biggest strengths that I've had it Google and helped me in my career I'm very close with like every engineering team I've ever worked with on the my first year at Google I was actually contributing code to the lake  to the code base just because  it was just easier for me to like submit Polish changes then work with someone to do it I've done that less now because I've as I've gotten older I realize I don't think it's as valuable  of a valuable use of a design is time because there's just so much with  infrastructure that just becomes a pain to like keep track of  but having said that like a  regularly sit down and have program with my engine is T. like Pat Polish things of mine and I think that like my understanding of  coding in my technical   reasoning means that like one my designs are always much mall like real like that I'm thinking about his ability as I design but to like I can kind of communicate with them to describe what I want and actually like often they'll be like oh I don't think this is possible and then I'll actually just like write them like a code snippet that they'll use  to do it and I think that's  because it Google there's actually like for better or worse  we don't hire like front an engine is to be like front engineers we don't hire them because they're great at building for like  visual things yeah and so often like a lot of the team like they'll be kind of back in engine is a very technical engineers who have just been put on a team that happens to be implementing something   like scripting something and so  they might not know some of the like really cool  CSS things that they can do on and that I can help them with  so do you feel like it am  it raises the level of trust within your team as well  yeah consistently like throughout all the different teams I've worked with like they've always I I've always gone great feedback from the from my engineer saying that it's like a great skill it's a great like di like they are much more willing to trust my design decision because they know that I've thought about like how much extra work what it is I'm asking of them is and I've decided that this is worth it   compared to say maybe like a designer who maybe less cynical and everything they show is a little bit more blue sky and now it's hard for them to like identify like what's what's that if that makes sense changing topic a little bit and you recently gave a talk at U. X. U. on design it tells what drove you to wanna give that took  so firstly I love to teach I like torn high school a torn  university I a teach part time at G. A.   let's dig into that a little bit more like why do you love to teach  I love teaching because as like  well first I I guess I Ellie of this conversation I said that there's nothing greater in this world then like writing code in seeing it but I guess either an equal or likes very close second feeling is like working with someone and at the beginning of time with them they conte something and then seeing them be able to do something  when they walk out of the room so like even something as simple as I teach like  nine hour like an eight hour  introduction to coding to non engineers at Google and at the beginning of the day they lakes often don't even know how the internet works and by the end of the day like I will fully build and design like  resume with them and they'll actually like publish it to like the web to the internet and like having your all they can show people very cool and  I guess it's in a way it's almost me trying to share that joy of creation with more people and show them that it's like it's not that hard that you can do it too if you want to    so that's like one reason is I just I love teaching for that reason fundamentally but also because like I am  I'm a designer but I'm also like an engineer at Houghton lake fission see is my favorite like thing I cannot stand watching like it's really hard for me to watch another design a like work if they like being really slow and being really efficient because I just want to be like Wyalusing shock us wine you doing these things like why you wasting your time like red lining for like days when you could just do something else and I'll just do it for you like  I think that's why I told the classes because I just think that the the  the feisty or are at the tool and like the quickly you are doing things that I like boring the more time you can spend thinking about like real design problems and actually innovating  and solving like the things that the computer console Sir  a you teach at General Assembly and I get there any other classes that you took the you've got real value from  yeah so I teach so I teach General Assembly I teach  do computer science summer institute which is a  computer science program full rising like basically seniors have just graduated going into computer science from underrepresented backgrounds  so like racial minorities and Jenna minorities and low socio economic backgrounds   I love teaching that because one it really means a lot to them it's really awesome to see people that age also growing learning the first time and feeling empowered and I also learned a lot from them as well about like what their allies alike and what their perspectives alike so I think it's like very much to a street  I think you know I often think to myself how lucky it was that I just by some random chance like fell into this near pets thing and how like how much of an impact it had on my life that I literally had nobody to show me that and it's just almost a coincidence like if I hadn't met that person maybe I would be doing something completely different that I wouldn't enjoy the little bit of teaching that I've done it both as your confidence a little bit when you can realize you can teacher teach somebody something and from start to finish like you do absolutely I think IT like stand by the fact that teaching has only made  like a lot better because I think there are skills you have the navy and you just want to do them but forcing yourself to re explain it to someone else it almost forces you to think about it more concretely and know it know how to talk about it   and like the active explain someone else makes you'll actually internalize it and give what you can reason until like maybe something that was a little bit more soft all like in eight originally   and I think that's the true test  like that's basically what I did to university I would teach like a lot of the university classes I was doing I like twenty eight CI on at university and like teaching university students which is kinda what forced me to be like okay make sure I got I actually know what I'm doing right now him talking about because they're like university results kind of depend on it other any classes that you wish were offered a Google in the growth conformant  yeah I wish that like efficiency like tool efficiency was told a little bit more like I think sketch like that does that cost is not exist I made it for you X. you so wish like that was being told mall I wish that  maybe we had a little a few more excuse not exactly relevant  for  well I just think that Google has so many tools that they built for engineers to like make the engineering process that out and more efficient and the same is not happen for design is so design is a still like spending a lot of time  on things like not  valuable like can give an example and this is  Jerry I mean red lines is like the biggest number one thing all even things like we don't have consistency in how we like build out files each team probably has their own system but like  I'm pretty proud because I think my team actually like outfalls really clean and like they're very well made and it's really easy to like jump in and like they like puzzle pieces because  I try to set a very like streaked kind of like not strict that sounds limiting but I'm pretty careful about  making sure we have like downing boxes on things and I'm componentized ing symbols and that there that it's Modula  the way that an engineer would build an apt to be Modula  but sometimes they can I sell a lot of time I think that like design is if you don't have that discipline in their team  it means that like maybe it's quicker at the very beginning but you don't get the because you didn't put time at the very beginning to like make things neat  at the end of the day like  it becomes like exponentially harder to read line something that hasn't been organized probably or    to to duplicate and I create screens that I kind of like off schuessel's like the same screen but the difference in our area it becomes like a lot hotter because it's not neat and it's not like well put together  so I think more  teaching about like process in  optimizing like design being efficient with the tools yeah being a vision with the tools  ask you a few questions just let record up a little bit what are you most excited about going forward  I mean I guess because I'm in design mode so I'm just like thinking about design stuff but I like I said I'm most excited about lake scene where like the tools go and seeing how that like merges informs together   to get more like as I said the unified like the way the engineers think in the way the designers think  I'm also really excited about what this is kind of exciting and scary but like  at the same time which is like what is the role of the U. S. as I'm going to be in like five years  like ten years because  it's changed it changes so fast and so and and awaits exiting you profession but at the same time like technology moves and changes so fast  that lake who knows if it's still going to be as relevant anymore   but I think like there's always going to be room for like problem solving like problem solving the layer of how humans interact with technology but it might just be different like and use to see how the I. takes off and like how you exes and it like one of the new U. X. paradigms for like such a reality I think well like so very far away from that being like super relevant right now  but that's not to say that  it's not far off though it's not yeah it's like it's not that far off and  there are so many established paradigms for like the screen that it's almost like  it's not easy anymore like it's that's definitely not the right word but it is a lot more  like directed in a way like there's a lot you can kind of pool from and inspired like you can get inspiration from bought  as we shift to this like fiat thing it's going to be completely different like and  home is going to be a land grab like the way that when the iPhone came out it was such an exciting time view exes line because those like a land grab for like designing cool interactions and I remember like even apple would like you there were like the famous cool design like well designed apps and even apple would like take take take the interactions that were coming up and collapse and put into their own like  like operating system like tweet is like swipe down to re fresh like  it's kind of amazing to have like design that pad and seeing that in like so many other places and I think that's gonna happen again for V. R.  and not just be a bit like as we move to more like XO screens not just like TV OS's but like touched multiple turn multiple touch screens out like mold like that can be used by most people the same time like that kind of stuff like there's so many interesting ways that as we move into the future and like those screens become a prolific like new patents again for that  thing is the place to live  yeah all right thanks so much for your time thank you  just a final word from a cyclical design did you know you can sign up for Google designs quarterly newsletter covering the latest and greatest design stories from Google and beyond will you have to do is go to design dot Google dot com forward slash Musetta putting your details and receive all this goodness straight into your inbox one of my favorite parts is actually the five things to love right now section this is a curated list of cool things chosen by people like Google and I always learn something new alright that's it from us  \",\n",
       " \"all right I'm gonna be roll my sleeves up writing code all day and I was shocked to see that like most of my time was spent in user studies historically we've been designing and developing sites where you load everything in one go but doesn't seem to make much sense  one of the challenges for designers developers with P. WAC site  will be pushing that this is a great way to make your site behave like an apple like way this was of a P. I. C. can access fight for mobile devices specially but it's really hard to do it like is that the entry barriers re hi I'm Anna five base is working on ways like to mitigate that making the berry the entry rainy like love an easy to use am our house by basting okay you said there is these like these apple like things and so you kind of thing okay well like what do people expected apps like a usually see things that are like sixty frames per second or things just feel very like instant and and like just like you tap it and it's their data updates and like with the  fire story is this database where you just update one thing and then like almost immediately you see that other device just update and you know went to the cloud and everything and have whenever when change happens just synchronizes across all these connected devices and that is one of those things I give you this app like sort of elements that you see things change immediately that your data is sort of ubiquitous across all your devices and also with apps use expect them to just work off line yeah and you know if you install an app just you know remotest part is all there in first or you know does the same thing whenever you like  a change it will actually save it locally so when you go offline like I delta I can repeat of you and and I was really trying to find these instances where like what's something that I can build that works the same offline that it does online if I'm just do it online I see changes across like a note taking app but with the camera app and you know use the you know web you know user mediate PI built a little camera take pictures and then it seems it and you know this photo feed and the cool thing is is like I'll go on an airplane to take pictures it you know it'll keep it on the local advice and once I get over the network to start sinking and that wasn't something that like I don't have to install my own database on the server or like locally or set up you know all this talk and index TV and stuff and it's just like I just use the farmers library and I just wanna get these features out of the box and it kind of just get rolling and I get to care about building my apt and not caring about like how is offline work how does this data connection work I get to kind of focus the things that my rather be doing centers like using I mean I don't want to like one thing I'll be speaking about like Alex Russell was like tool adoption is all about ease for the developer the designer I said what what prices like the one in still made it like I minute install yeah like even though I mean and eyes are fashionable to hate PHP and what press whatever but it's designed as a tool for someone to using of the ground just to do the job they want to do without installing a hundred different libraries it was really good at that I mean I mean five base appeasing movies following us and kind of philosophy is just really simple to set up I mean from like that I've been working on for  it's just like like two weeks ago is like my fourth year on fire Mason like I in my first week there we spent the we're actually gonna launch for base hosting and we like all I did was spend all this time in user study meetings like I enjoying this company or bill and real time data base and Java script libraries and I thought like all right I'm gonna be roll my sleeves up writing code all day and I was shocked to see that like most of my time was spent in user studies and I would just sit and like that double pane style window I mean not literally they felt like that could you look at the user and they would just be struggling trying to get something set up that you knew exactly what they needed you next year like that click that button just please click that button they look at you and they're like well why do you think I can help you and so watching it like the users like not get it and not show is that it's a reflection on you and so we've been focusing from you know the very start like you can't just get up and running in five minutes it's not gonna work and so like the whole point we always saw is like we we sort of paint this picture of what we want to achieve so the beginning was that struck this Java script librarian and now we have this real time connected apps and you didn't have to set anything up and now then we evolved on to authentication and was like okay I want to be able to log in users with you know with Google email password all these different types of providers an hour on a server I also drop in Java script library and now you have that and then with hosting it was the same thing like how fast can we get that site from like not existing on the internet tune deployed with SSL on a CD and like just like by default just has a fast performance  so all those things are and just sort of like in our blood and she's always been our number one like guiding principle as like low barrier to entry get started in five minutes and just go to say like I want to I'm a web designer who's not very technical and I just wanted to get my site up like custom to mine I bow my head and I am David the shop dot com for effect and how quickly can I get that with your   that custom to mine and my serve up together like  actually own David D. A. dot S. T. as very proud that one  and so I get so like it was very interesting if you  like it doesn't matter who your domain provider is if you  it with Google remains is really easy  because we you know work with them but pretty much you to plant or sow service hosting and you get you know whatever your project name is dot firebase apt dot com and that's like a sell out of the box like you know you have your green lock on medically and then we have a sort of like why do you why were you say okay  I want to set up a custom domain and pretty much we say okay you have to put these records into your domain registry and then you click this button and we'll check to see if they exist and when they do that's it your domain names just set up that fast amazing M.  I mean there is some critical five base there and a lot of it's to do with speed because like we always push  even at the Java script code flight and basic minimum get something  painted on screen as quickly as possible but I free seconds and this could take that the five base  include is quite large systems of these two conflicting things from our point of view and  what kind of it is due to solve that problem and what is five a state to well I think like the web is it's kind of like this weird point we're like we're trying to do like so much of the web like you're saying like once the more apt like well with apps they have this you they can include a fifty megabytes library that's goes through an install time and it's just like no no goes over wifi no sweat off someone's back for the web like that's unacceptable like here you can never have fifty megabytes of anything on the web and so were in this battle of how do we get more features but yet not lose this foundational principle we have of being like fast loading and so like what I've been doing is like kind of thinking about okay well what what is the first thing you have to do a load so you always need you know this like really minimal viable part of your app and select the Firestar library is you know it is a larger library because it does so much it's basically like your own little database and browser even for a database it's still how it's really small but yeah it does a lot but you don't want that side if you're like your work serving content to users you know what that library sitting in your critical path you can render it she mail on the server send that down and you just have HTML CSS and is really minimal layer of like Java script to do here like rendering and then what I found is that when you run sort of fire store in this way where it becomes an enhancement on top of that app then when it loads in real time kicks and offline kicks in and if this architecting with your app your user continues to use it and then as they continue to use it just get that enhancement to it and you don't want to say  okay my app is only available once every single asset I have is needed for you have to have those like progressive bootstrapping of your app if if you're going to combine like having features on the web and also being performed I mean are you working on the canal knock textual concept where you splitting things into into free could you explain a bit more light axes and I what I thought I was coming up on my own thing but it's kind of like if you think that you've done it you just have to go see if ideas money is the first of which he has he has a word for it so like progressive bootstrapping is sort of the way to think of it so you like the fares very minimal thing you need for your app is just HTML CSS like that will get you really far and then a having a Java script like sort of like layer on top of it whether using a framework like react react you know angular whatever that can just be an enhancement on top of the HTML and CSS and at that point you have this app that can function every time it receives data so something comes over the network the view changes or user interacts with that something in the apathy comes more dynamic and it doesn't really matter whether the data comes from the app can be fairly like agnostic of that so few architect in the way where if you just progressively load fire store into it when fire Sir is ready to be loaded these features just you know this kind of like trickle in and and the user just now all set and might see things and made on the page when they like here in real time then when they're like they go off line that date is nine cast on the device like a quite often we I mean historically we've been designing and developing sites where you load everything in one go but doesn't  seem to make much sense says what you're advocating the only calling for features as and when they need it so you're not loading the whole database if it's not required you know loading the notification bet if it's not necessary in that particular point I mean and encodes floating in some ways works really well for that you're basically saying like okay I if you did your app up into separate routes like I don't want to load my slash profile code on my home page again doesn't make sense like H. yeah I can have a performance game I just not including that when it's not needed this is more self aware you're saying I I will need fire store  but I don't need it immediately and if including like this Java script in my rent I am my critical path is going to cause the apt to take longer to load and let's let's find a way to sort of ease it up so we kind of be progressively give the browser when it can handle so we'll start with HTML and CSS that appears and then we have our like our our Java script that enhances it so becomes very easing and so we do intend on having all these things but if something happens users not running Java script okay that's fine we still have content for them or let's say they're on a really slow connection well we did get the initial content and we also got the javascript framework but it's gonna take longer for fire circle it maybe that times out and that never loads but the app still is usable in each one of these forms and so we we aspire to get all three of these on the page but we sort of have these like escape hatches where if if was long as we get to one of these points we're gonna be okay wait okay you know there's a heart beat  there's a whistle  Hey maybe someone sees an enormous  that's actually  \",\n",
       " \"usability testing is all about light for me exposing the problems and exposing what works really well for use as an understanding why research is already like I said that just different tools like this and if I have a better than a screwdriver depend thing you're trying to find out  so one thing again ostalo about is people like the idea of research they know it's simple and it's like flossing everyone of you should do it but then at the house and how does someone start getting into doing research like if they know next nothing about it if you're thinking about you'll put that actual sort of developing it at that stage of recent than it's just great to get people using it for the task that you're planning at full so even if that friends family even if that people in the office it's just great to get your and product exposed to people like that say that you can watch what happens and in usability testing we really looking for the problems for people fall into and out what works well for them why it works well for them and so having anybody go through your products and you will see those things as faint as they went through every time you'd want to you know start testing the border range of uses am and get out of this kind of biases that come in with friends and family but to start off and gain confidence and start small it's great case to stop so we talk about usability testing is there anything on the policies am isn't big specific that you're supposed to look for so you've you've designed to wrap you given at your friends or family is there any like  was a golden rules of things to look out for  is not really what kind of yeah well what do you make sure you do it  it's kind of set up the tasks that you want to be watching for  so basically you have people pay for the tasks and may speak out loud as they do it often depending on what you're testing phone and so you'll be identifying you'll sort of most critical use Ajani's usually and have them walk through that and often that something like some language you use we collect content in I am though but you got on the button  when your physician something that just doesn't make sense for most of the people that totally makes sense to you in your design work  you'll on development went that it doesn't work for the people and say you're looking for baton you've got them speaking out loud so you can really understand kind of wind that coming out things and send ways and that's the value of usability testing you know as opposed to looking at data from logs or something you really understanding the why of why they they get into certain situations where they called me for what Ole Ole sudden flows went really really well I mean is there like a scared of research so like what usability testing feels like it's like the mid point of the product line second ed but is there like a before and after because I know  there's also the debates of  you as a user groups you have when you're asking questions also face I mean is how would you say is like the cycle of doing research was the first thing you wrecked would you recommend before even building thing or maybe when you call IT stages yes I've right at the beginning we tend to do what we call foundational resets that's when we really understanding that the main we might use also you in a second baby sat sh and see what else other people have done  but we might also do foundational we set  often involves more sort of failed recess techniques going out to when people  doing the activity that you're interested in supporting in your product  so failed visits doing observational wanna I'm contextual inquiry is a particular technique where you with the past and throughout the day and asking kind of questions as you go along to really understand why they didn't send things in their environment so that's the whole night foundational reset stage at some point you might want to understand sort of bored representations of data  you might do  seven wet I always recommend doing some sort of qualitative went to begin with  whether that's you know your contention in Crimea interviews  so especially if a survey said that you've got the range of results that you would want to ask for a particular set of a question if you come back can you pass this kind of clothes and a question with different  question I'm says and next to it but you've missed a couple of really significant things out then yo yo this does real problems if you sat by so doing that qualitative went to begin with is really really helpful and then  you if I had to I think you were meeting probably focus great yeah sometimes get a bad rap here and so focus groups on use that much in use a reset  occasionally I've used them and it's really been more for my benefit of finding out at the main kind of haven't used them for Rick arrest in a representative data but am conducting a focus group helps me understand like these all the point important topics that most of the people with an estimate  yeah and then I can go forward and do my at the technique says more about posting your own knowledge rather than finding information out about that's how I've used them then you have like this kind of always versus mentality intact but I mean do you think there is a better way of research with quality of a constant  are these is that like a pointless thing to be asking is really about using those to just get a better understanding of the problem front so size one better than the ever in your opinion or is that it doesn't really work like that that's a very complimentary and you need both so  when it comes to the stage of doing usability testing often times we might when we really into sort of initial use of the product to we've gone out that to to beta test as   where we've already launched and we doing studies then then you can collect blokes data oak St there is light really very very useful you can see where people are dropping off on a page for example a wide and  converting for example and you can't necessarily with understand why and so pondering that with usability testing is a really valuable and say that we can really understand the why and I'm not you know all all quantitative data has in a huge number is it a  Dodge number this large as we can get on the day two is as representative as we can get we really are very concerned about that in usability testing it's not so much of a requirements to make sure that your participants are truly representative of the population because you'll looking for pain points and you were trying to understand the why it is that people have these problems said that you understand them  enter modeling you avoidable at designing in that way again yeah I know one criticism of usability testing such like we say sometime this week sports between five and eight people is that enough like to really  solve the problems your your terms of or is it not user base testings already like that's what but it's not comparing it to  say I service what you're doing a hundred people is with us about six points that's exactly right so am in seven days you have to be really show that you're getting as good and as a sample as you can as as representative of a kind of the population that's of interest to you and that's a bad idea sampling techniques to do that correctly otherwise it's going to be problems with your sensei as we've often seen in voting and polling kind of thing  with usability testing with doing something else quite a quite different made a wet using usability testing to understand what problems people have with the design as they go through as they try and complete that task  and so what happens is often you see you start saying the same problems again and again and you really land that you know all this is kind of a problem for everyone in fact the can be problems that you see right at the beginning of running a studies say after we even one or two people annual night yes of course you know I should have seen of course people think of it and not when of course and dropping off at this point and you don't need many many people to prove that and and so you tend to find after five oh eight then you've seen the majority of the problems if you you've probably seen eighty percent of the problems if you carry on testing you will see more problems over time but  you'll have caught all the main ones in the fast five to eight and it will be definitely diminishing returns on that same design a product and is there a point while pivot in the research said Lysaght we've done to test on the app or website these really obvious problems the wise obese whatever comes up do you stop and say right we can adjust the why and that that the design thing I carry on testing again Ole does that muddy the waters I mean is it okay to do that yet now is totally okay to do that and that's actually a form of testing gold light usability testing and and then we schedule two or three people to come in and then we have a break and like half a day or a day with the team get together and talk about what they've seen and how they can adjust tent and then you get to to the more people come in and do the same again and and it's a right on it and it's it's a great idea ready because you don't really want to will need to see kind of five state she's as old and you know fall into the same problem if you won't agree as a team that that problem exists the needs fixing there were other problems when you know you're not shoals somebody somebody you know goes one way and somebody else goes another and it's really you that might be a few different mental models out that when you kind of have to see how it goes over time to see what what the main issues are and what your teen fails need fixing that sent me  that's another good reason to do it as well that that was obvious ones that you really want to fix might be sort of hiding other problems that wouldn't be exposed if you didn't fix those ones during the course of the fact that the other thing I am remember you you did the research particle the twenty five principles of web design wasn't as the go  principal web web fascinated weapon and we did that happen we hunted holes that me down speaking he's like this almost like but my mind was plan when you talk about you do a pre study before the study to test the CEO of the studies actually get when that comes out of course you do and could you explain a bit about like what time is it called a pre study a pilot study right confined it steady and safer usability testing me am yeah exactly like state with testing the test we want to make sure that I am the different tasks that we ask people a sort of lining up top plan makes sense for them  we want to make sure that those plays wept as we think we should at the time and and the product am is absolutely crucial today pilot testing beforehand yeah you can do that with own techniques  vis a vis such that there are many techniques that we have and also talked about a dive you study is a something that sometimes done we can test the questions that we're asking people in the diet study even seven days it's important to test your survey instrument out fast and we often do what we call cognitive pre testing which will sit down with someone and go through the questions to make sure all the questions mean to them what we think by me yeah I'm so just even going back to the beginning so you want to test you've done some test of your family what's the next thing I mean is there do you really at that point need to get a good researcher to help you plan these things or is this something that small teams and stops in do now like professional to test that yeah I'm well does absolutely you can do it Google ventures put some some good and guides for doing usability testing and different sorts of user research testing so that's a good place to look for how to do this from a start up perspective and  you know as a user reset so I personally don't think companies that hire you to reset to the early enough in order to get that kind of foundational research done a million to fund the space really need to be thinking about doing that high up earlier than me doing it now what tends to happen in companies if that people hire eventually they realize that the county design without designer that how it is I know and then the design is as white it's hard for me to do design without the research findings and to really understand the context I'm working and said that's the kind of like it tends to happen and it would be nice from my perspective if it went the other way around that's not to say that you know people shouldn't be doing user testing them sounds obviously you can get better is not the case advocated that you should work with family and friends it's just a good way to get started and you will find issues with your product but  it's better to try although you're not aiming for in five to eight people a representative sample of the population you do want to trying to get the same sort of people that you that are at you you I need to put it full so you if you'll be creating at a music capped fourteen ages than it be great to test on teenagers that that  that sort of talk it uses for your product is is also important to test for demographic as well like in terms of the way users will behave in India be very different way they behave in America right right and then I went to a different sort of constraints and different different context and different conditions with you know the kinds of friends that use  different and can activity they have all those kind of cultural things which basically have a response to you are you have  and how is that is it just basically you need to get on the field I mean I  one thing people do is they tested much in front of the computer when they're that amazing mac Burkle at amazing wifi connection but that how do you really empathize clinic research is more about improvising the passage on a design for right right absolutely and so I think you know we need to take account of the technological constraints that we just talked about you know making sure that when it when I mean for those kind of markets that we potentially and they're in India we have a lot better can activity nowadays but in certain parts of the well there's a lot of the web that still on TV connections taking those kind of considerations into account is important but also you're right that the the cultural and different contextual factors can be really important so what if you're testing for  uses preferences of a two designs if you court two separate things how do you know your testing for the right things or the person's opinion what they  preferences they have yeah that's a tricky one I think that you know I'm not greatly in favor of testing using usability testing for preferences because it's such a small sample potentially the sample might be biased if you asked with eight different people you might come up with different preferences especially if you would just adding up the numbers a million are in favor of that because it has these problems you know usability testing isn't ready for that purpose so I'm not and against asking about preferences in order to understand why people have those preferences I think that can be really useful in usability  so understanding you know that they need particular things say and maps when then navigating any particular nomarchs yeah that's really really interesting but you know just like trying to cut more numbers about they put  thirty nine a month and then just one day they preferred plates read to mean is that how people lie right when you Austin questions they might tell you what you they think you want to not absolutely so this is why I'm much more into like understanding them completing a task and understanding like what what for them and what doesn't might find them about completing that task it's really what about getting that deep understanding in usability studies so yet don't add up the numbers for preferences light but use that and to understand why that particular design is perfect and for another one  and what we can do for future designs to make it more useful for people and spread out from the context from within the personal opinion of yes well  yeah that's right and understanding why that context it leads to that view  I try as much as possible to avoid black magic and like whenever I'm reviewing any code that any of the designers on my team are writing we like trying to avoid anything that maybe it's a little hacking it makes it slightly more performant but the truth is like if we want to have all the material design system we need to be able to build on top of the code and each layer of that could matters  \",\n",
       " \"and the team at Google that has started on crown was actually we were all working Firefox when you most people what you want is the way they want more more but they never use those things and it's really hard and quite Brae thinks they know within a script stuff away  those internal talk about how from this bill and I think back to that time a it's an exposed on the browser and five folks was just was fighting and like with the developer tools will become quite prevalent and safari was was was just released I believe and  with a sizeable the browser so how do you stop in that environment with a so much competition crumb was released in two thousand a year actually started on it in two thousand six alma and the team at Google that has started on crown was actually we were all working fire fox  when I first joined Google beginning in two thousand five the idea was to work on making the web better when when did you guys work on making browsers better as we started out as a team working on making Firefox better year and a half into it we made the switch to actually build our own browser that was a big bank on complicated decision right because  in we had already regarding going down a certain path right I so  looking back I think there are a number of factors right first off we thought we could do a really good job and had to be true yeah  but also  you know there are a lot of things about browsers and those days that I think were created a frustrating user experience yeah  you gotta go but going back two thousand six you know applications like gene now yeah maps in YouTube and so on these things   up becoming popular in other folks are building complicated web applications like this and the and your typical browser in that day she relieved email running overnight   your come back the next day in your browser feel pretty sluggish and bogged down because of just the weight of these applications and so way back then we we had the idea that would be really nice to split up the browser into multiple process he's right  operating systems and counter revolution from the days of windows three point eleven to ten windows NT and so on yeah where preemptive multitasking was the thing OS nine to OS ten a could we use preemptive multitasking can we take advantage of actually multiple processes on the systems for web browsing and seem pretty pretty a pretty like at actually seem possible if you are thinking about a browser from scratch yeah I mean in terms of like the U. X. off again it's like I'm back to the beginning of light passes over the prices of that time reminds me a bit like search before giggles like such was basically portal sites and the such input fields like with my sleeves one thing I'm but then kill came alongside nine at that it's the wrong use experience with going ekran came about it was quite radically different because I remember this phrase is that content no crime yeah and Sir just making that kind of you X. decision of like you know because those will cool boss I remember you instill anything everything to affect you  compact and is very common to find a user of internet explorer and then install multiple toolbars as much as one to apartment multiple to ours and theirs is great absurd screen shots of  yeah browsers had like five two bars and a lot of room for the content right  so one of the things with crumbs content a crumb idea was to really remember that the whole point is people engage with the web application website the web content and brothers just might try to get away just facilitate yeah helping you use the web and so even when we design extension system we resisted the idea of having a first class where proper waited you toolbars or side bars we really didn't want  extensions over here really him using up screen space   when that screens based users really want that for the contents that we design things like extension buttons that would be the primary access point try to guide things in a way that would  preserve that notion even if you live crumb itself tried to keep it very minimalistic  you know we spend a lot of time in the early days thinking if we're gonna introduce another browser scholarly so awesome right got it and what is I mean it's got to have like the most amazing features it's got a like have a whole new take on browsers gotta be radically different you lie  surely that would be the reason why we're doing this right yeah  but in and we tried many different things playing tabs on the side  no fancy user jester kinds of things mouse gesture types of things I mean none of that really felt right at least into that process we came to realize what what actually we're doing what really would set from part is there's a browser supports better yeah caning software that's not frustrating is actually hard to do yeah  and I think users appreciate it and so I started to think about and what does that really mean for us it was like all products should be for  simple right should try to China's come with elegant you I choices keep it simple  it should be performed by a said browsers  preservation of being Jenkin out well behaved and an end user has an expectation and click on something special and it's the chrome of the U. I am it's the the browser you why they click on it they say close this tablet your clothes right away you know ed  for the course those days was you click close the click to close the tab and you said you might see a beach ball on mac OS ten or eight or nothing happens on windows you start to see the application not responsive problem right but in chrome because we wanted this multi process architecture  able to guarantee that if you click close on the tap it's gone yeah and for those examples of like responsive you I that you know sometimes we talk about performance speed we mean account of welded performing a benchmark but a lot of times it comes down to like was experience smooth responsive to the user input that it actually do what the user wanted it when the user on it that kind of thing so simplicity speed we also put a big focus on security and stability so had these FOR **** here and that was the thing that we just repeat it to ourselves if you're not sure what to work on work on one of those things work on making it simpler design work on making more performant work on making it you know more secure said and really was security wing making it so users feel safe on the web feel control of their privacy they understand what's going on  but also that it's the system is is  protecting you from our and so on and again our multi process architecture not only helped us make something for performance but also something worse  care browser more secure and finally it helped a lot of stability we knew that starting school scratch with a browser that might actually be the biggest concern is that gonna just crash and how do you how do you exercise and offer the browser in your testing to know that you've got it right now   we base the browser on not  Firefox it with we based it on webkit which is wet at that those days that was so far two point now safari three had just come out  and webkit safari was known to not necessarily be the most compatible with the web right on modern web standards driven by Firefox were just becoming a thing internet explorer has had a lot of quirks about it internet explorer six for now lot of quirks especially thinking about like flute yes I help with the flow model yeah box model all these things were very impactful to like how web pages are built if a developer was testing lab with internet explorer there's would be the quirks that they would go to if they're testing lot with Firefox we'd see that and the safari it was like well probably they were testing ari and so it was a big challenge in a big fear we launch chrome is it gonna just crash all the time yeah are we gonna how we gonna manage that so we Prahlada effort in in fact that same issue informs like our choice of the user agent string anybody seen the user agent string of chrome it's kind of hilarious because it mentions every every browser ever since crown came along and and that was part of navigating this whole like doesn't work a conundrum we waste  in software development and you X. add more features because more features means more value I mean was there a push back was it was a like a fair made with taking way too much from the present you why  we certainly ugly launched in it originally crime without any extension support and even the bookmark manager went was  was was revised quite a bit mail post the national beta things like this so we we intentionally went with a very minimal approach but we also really encourage the team to try a lot of things with the idea that knowing going into it that we would probably throw away things that are good and that was the   the mantra if you well like let's just try a lot of stuff  and and if it doesn't work it's okay we just start it's it's not the end of the world we don't have to ship everything we try I think that was really liberating really helpful because there are a lot of folks in the team at different had had interesting ideas and and it's empowering for people to try stuff it's also you know appropriate that means we have to say because we built it we should check looking back what would you say with a group of the best decisions you made and also the two part what you would you regret in terms of like  yeah things that you did that you'd wish you hadn't I mean you because I'm an engineer as it is definitely an engineer at that is days  and I feel really good about some of the decisions we made an engineer from an Asian focus on you know we really put a lot of  we we talked a lot about how important was that we're building a product not building a platform I mean ultimately is a product that carries web platform but what I mean by not building a platform is it sometimes there's a temptation as engineers to go off and build framework and and tools for creating the product that you're actually there to greet you and we really resist that that a lot  tried to make sure that we focused on all as much of our energy on like actually building a browser  and she was very helpful to take to make sure that that that's what we did so for example we said first we're just building windows browser and that meant that's just use win thirty two straight away all the Microsoft API's  not looking for any cross platform toolkit framework to build are you why yes one day will bring this to mac when they will bring it to Lennix you know and so on but like for now we're just building a windows application and when we went to finally build a mac product a product for us and we we told some engineers a Google we said Hey you wanna come work with us we'd love for you to build the best browser for us and and we want you to approach it the same way that we approach building for windows which is all the you I should be co coach all the native and we want you to have the freedom and flexibility to apple's embrace the native operating system parents but also  move quickly as those planets change yeah there was involves a so let's build a mac focused product again with this idea that it's we're building a product on a platform for building browsers about what ends up happening is you do this and we did the same thing Lennix ones of happening as you do this is you know we start to realize we are coding same thing three times yeah I am and later on things like android came along and iOS and chrome OS and so at our world a lot more complicated and what we ended up doing is or is this arc from the singular I'm building a product to I'm starting to build platform things that help me build up product crossed and different platforms and that came afterwards and I think that was actually somewhat healthy and in a bit it to a certain extent I kind of have some regrets that we built chrome so much as a monolithic product so  while there is some  structure that's healthy and good and and look there is somewhat of a layer cake if you well there are there are some cuts that some some extra layers indicate that should have been there  and now we have  a lot of complexity because we did make some of those cuts earlier within modularized necessarily as much as we should have but again I think that came from that that focus on just building this product and does not need to be extra will need all that extra modular modularity and now we find ourselves wishing we had a maybe down a little more hello more forethought on that what would you say that this is that were made that were actually really good to the success of the past SO design examples and engineering samples there is this one one concept that was came up very early which was  and we wrestled with is a bit so  the the content area the tab right we started with the idea that there are some we will actually have some browser you I that lives in a tab so for example when you open a new tab page there's there's some contention to suggestions about things you might want to do yeah we started out building that natively and we started to find ourselves discovering an uncanny valley  as developed users have this expectation that things inside the tab hit like web page but building that not using web technologies meant that some things are suddenly not right yeah selection behavior wasn't there context menus not there in the same you know just things were subtly different  so we scrapped and we built the new tab page using web technology and now it fit better everything we didn't have all those little niggling little bugs just felt natural it felt natural fit with the product on the flip side we had some dialogues and some of those dialogues  see they were built natively but a few of them were built using web and he never felt quite right and so then we came to this discover that like let's be opinionated about this and it's a dialogue it's done natively and if it's in the continent it's done with a tab and then we avoid this sort of  uncanny valley situation when crime came out there was that designing for best viewed in internet explorer six am and it's interesting you say that the time  a web kit was not the priority with the benefits now we've shifted ten years later I was seen best viewed in crime old **** webkit browser right ma'am so there's this constant fear that way possibly entry back to the past where if if if if development stops then uses and like web technology becomes like   stagnant I answered soon great question I think that  there's a couple different things that happen with IP six right some offers of Microsoft stock involving a guy's arm and we're not stopping involving guys we are our mission is to make the web better and so we continue to invest in that I'm in the way of investing that is it's very important to work with the standards community gather rather ventures in particular and web developers and get her right yeah  one of the dangers of of shipping API if you're the only one on the browser shipping it is that you might come to find that there's a better way to do that it got a better design and in the end result is will be tempted to ship the new design as well to better design but we won't will have trouble leaving behind the old design now will ship two ways to do something yeah or in the worst case three ways to do something if you look at CSS gradients you'll see there's multiple ways and this comes from this this  and I'm not aware browser ships early then they learn that  Gee I wish I'd done it differently and then he they ship it that way too and then  Gee I wish you would do differently and they ship it that finally and so you end up with a multitude of ways to do things on the web from gets really complicated and we don't want to but developed web developer TV trash file that rate we want to keep it simple and make sure if you guys work well so we want to do our  do a good job and that means spending time with other browser vendor spending time with web developers learning understanding all these cases and being very deliberate in the standards process but we should still be able to ship something finally and sometimes we do have to take some calculated risk yeah and sometimes we are the first browser just a penny P. I. but we hope to do that in a way that that stands the test of time   looking for pain points and you were trying to understand why it is that people have these problems so that you understand that mental model in you avoidable and designing in that way again  \",\n",
       " \"how the someone knows that no good to how the someone know that they could suit in order to be good at something you need to practice that scale but in order to judge whether you are good at something you just kinda needs experience I'm so if you work in software development for a long time near exercise your design skills you can still understand you about it to overtime like you get a more mobile sense of just how bad you are  is if you actually exercise their skills you'll you'll get even more experience and you will see how bad you are compared to your idea of perfection what you think stops developers from eighty one because I mean that's a common thing why don't you do decide I'm terrible design or what like when we do design Spence's like you tell people that one point  you have to sketch and everyone panics Kongtrul is like you can if you try a little bit I think that is the the gap between skill and experience if you work in software development I'm you will you will  come to understand what a good design looks like just by working with design is you all get you'll see designs the works he designs that don't work you'll get a good feel for what work and then if you try that yourself it won't be as good you'll narrow from your experience that your your design is not is not good enough and  or at least feel that isn't good enough and that will  put your from trying the future there's no point icon design you know I shouldn't questions even bother so the  the thing a developer needs to do if they want to be if I had to be in to do the design same time  is just practice just do it do even though you'll know that it's bad   because over time you will get good yeah and you might still think you're bad but that's fine you're in the practice of doing even though you think you're at some point in this with venom in Korea and I mean I don't ask you for your good design about this one you have is of unique so I feel like I'm a really bad design a and I think that's because I have a lot of experience and I have never personally really taken back leak in  progress my skills are least on certain kinds of design certainly laying out to web page I like I I know how to mechanically will make the web page look like a design that I've been given but I couldn't produce that design like am I a I don't have that visual imagination but I'm nervous because I haven't exercised that skill and places where I have exercised skill in things small like user interaction I'm  those places I feel I can do a better job you know I I E.  I know I'm not an expert but I also know that I'm  better than none at not being done by anyone yeah I mean again this S. expose the thing which I'm still frustrates me that you're developing you've done the venom stuff quite on time you know the process of learning it's like once you've learned something you realize that the kind of  this isn't a magic that takes to being good at something  it's just time by and time and effort so as a as a developer Mike I don't buy it that I'm not creative by yeah writing software is a creative process today it just uses very different techniques to arm visual design all use our inspectors to focus on I am so it's not the creativity that I feel that I like is just that time served during the designs seeing what was wrong going back and doing it like here to practice practice practice semi I do agree that   creativity there's a quite different coding but is on what is the thing that  a stop someone from wanting to explore so there are several reasons why I might or might not want to go on to be the design or what is just I'm like practicality if you have a designer that you can lean on Yahoo why not I mean that that is a that is a perfectly valid choice and say you know I don't have the skills and rather than spending time getting those skills I can just take someone who does have their skills and we can build a symbiotic relationship I'm I don't think that's necessarily good long term in your current you should have some design skills you should have at least an understanding of what the designers during you should do some stuff I also know that my time is limited  and I could spend time honing my craft as a developer or as a designer  and photo lots of people I am the choice will be just to stick with what you now it's  it's not even about like natural ability I think it  Kelly about comfort zone so yeah I I know that I will get better as a designer if I try  and  for me it's just being that I've never particularly had the impetus to try at least on visual design  I am the more recently I have been I see trying to be a better design  in less visual things for the video stuff you be welcomes more interaction design exactly so  working  with web via I have to  place things in the scene said that they  will make sense to the viewing when things could be out of your line of sight you need you need to draw people's attention to the correct things you need to make things show that things it's obvious how to interact with things you need to design your experience and understanding the limitations of  like the hardware things you don't have someone spinning around too fast you don't have someone moving too much if the if the headset isn't gonna recalled the movement  because there's a lot of things that will just make the the use of feel L. so you have you have design constraints as well as technicals constraints and you have to work to those I guess the trick is just to plow arm when you lost it when your bad  and it's easier at the beginning of your career because you don't understand you about  I don't see what the so much patience in the beginning and the end you think well this most of the stuff you have to have it says yeah I guess you also need the the the feeling of safety to put yourself out that with something that  I am you're pretty Shaw isn't gonna be goods but to be able to put that design out to your team and say look here's what I came up with the macum working in the future without feeling like you're going to be marked or ridiculed by a T. makes yeah  so just having a supportive team can help  I think it's so much a design is so much it's problem solving right so  so many people forget that when I think of design I think of the finished product but there's so many different stages of how you got to the finished product  \",\n",
       " \"designers feel that the grave process has become quite sterile and like you X. hassle taking way the kind of the creativeness of it said before and design would go to a college and and everything about that was that they crave prices coming intently but not having seems to be validated and everything to be like very sterile and the way we create things is all about replicating the same user experience patterns and you I elements and  and it feels like the validation Paul has taken away what it means to be creative at from developer perspective I must say the days were helpful  so I personally like it I like to you know have hard proof that the what I'm working on or decisions I'm making are having the direct impact on the user experience on the up I'm building or on the look and feel but I can totally see where you're coming from  when it comes to the creative process for example it's quite important and easy to measure stuff that is already out there to figure out if the decision was right or wrong but it's very hard to start with data and not to start the process of creating something new  from heart fox you need this in GT that you put into the up in the first place for example when I create some as a reference up  I want to showcase some technology or some new way of solving technological problem  but as a front end up so I need to make it look and feel nice at the same time  and they send this brand converse and then I pray to have some creative design there next to you know coming in with his ingenuity rather than just you know getting my data and following the data flow I mean does feel a bit like a chicken and egg situation what comes first the creative step of just discovery I actually like to think about it as a sandwich and all other than she can I is like  if you have some bread and then some feeling and then some bread again so I think it all starts with kind of creative process  by design or by some you know creative person that is working on a given product home to have a D. starting idea and then you get data and user testing go and all this you know heavy weaponry for   wishing the original idea so that it's the best  you can get but then at the top you still own the dispatch of ingenuity and all like when I think about different  visual frame marks on the web they kind of stop and this second layer they took the initial idea they applied a lot of data to make it as nice and you know to use and as usable and this browser friendly environment friendly whatever and you need and they stopped there but then designs to take such a visual framework and stash the something unique in all that to make a given the op or product outstanding and and sometimes I think we stop at the state level and we don't go through this extra step of heading somewhere aren't on top of it to make it extraordinary amazing I mean I've never ready for that I would always feels like one comes before  or the other and I know and I love working environments to feel like a factory in that respect that I draw the picture than a developing my implement the picture and then I take it back and say could you change the color back in and I think I suppose it's about finding a a a a process with both can really feel like they're making a sign which together in a kitchen rather than it being a conveyor belt  it's a little bit similar to when the engine methodologies and third the software wall to know where you go through different iterations of the  of the creative process and I agree when there was said the situation of our first to get the design out and then you give it to developers to implement it and that's it is very stressful for both sides because  developers who stressed that the design is not to be implementable to be honest like is not compatible with the technology and then design their starting grid because you know developers change their design and now it's not the prettiest it was before so I think it's all about making it more iterative and more collaborative and then it takes the stress out of both parties  and I know there are some there's some tension on the line every now and then  but to be honest I really like working with designers and there's this up I worked on  in December last year at Santa tracker it's  it's a Google up that  kind of trucks the steps of the Santa Claus throughout December up to the communication they where he goes around the world you know and gives the presence and and there's a lot of ops you can play and in that experience throughout the whole December and I was developing this up  we're a little  elf is going through a maze is navigating a maze finding presence and you can look at it Doug do you see the elf from the top so it's pretty much just the result of a little pointy hat  and kind of and my task was to make its jump through obstacles and I was totally stock and all that because you look from above and is just this red dot that is ahead how you make a jump into lakes you don't see arms I was I was stuck I implemented all the technological parts to it in two days and then for next week's I was like blank how to make it look right and the last four designer help and within a very short time he came up with the idea that you know if you make the dough to bigger and they're smaller looks like you know it's like floating in the air and then falling dollars this is so brilliant and I never thought about  thank you really need to and  trust in your competencies to them and ask for help when you need it  and what I love for us to do is to end up in a world where we have language and ideas that are native to the web itself embrace the fact that the web is hypertext not just a another way to build me to

       " \"resolutions my name's Bobby Ghosh on an injured around  remember park when faced its campus revert to talk to someone who I think maybe has the coolest job in design maybe maybe he's great  who is this new woods he's the head of design here is basically gonna tell us about his design philosophy the evolution of designing Facebook and dreaming design  really get to this stick around  one quick point message  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  thanks for joining us I'm really excited to be here awesome first question what's one thing about design that's clear to you that you don't think it's as clear to other people wow this is the big question  and it's a little bit hard for me to say exactly what it is that's clear to everybody else about design but I can share one thing that's clear to me and that is that right now is an incredible time to be a designer  so many of the products that we use and depend on  on day to day are products of design and the apps that we use on our phones the apps that we use to get work done the apps that we use to communicate and stay in touch with the friends and family who are most meaningful to us  these are all products of design and I'm not sure that everyone in the general public realizes that the apps that they use that they love day to day are products of design and that they could get involved in shaping those products if they were to get involved in the design field  you know I'm also not sure that so many people in the larger array of design disciplines like graphic design and industrial design architecture and so forth I'm not sure that the broader design community really realizes just how special the time is right now for digital product design  you see you got into the I listen to an interview with you where you said you got into design and idiosyncratic way and and your chance  I wonder do you think most designers get into designed that way because I I share similar story I didn't intentionally get into it  you know I'm one of the one of the one of the best designers that Facebook and he got started here doing an internship while he was in real estate development school  we have we have designers who got started  as as musicians and and  and we had  designers who who who who studied economics in school we've we even have designers who didn't go to school at at all and one as for example who joined us right out of high school and was just making apps and submitting them to the apps store and was just just doing it just living it  and then you know I think it is the case that many people and up falling into design and I I was really lucky and my mom is a career coach and my dad is a professor I grew up in Columbus Ohio and so you know my mom really wanted me to get out and experience different things and  you know my dad had a lot of different connections through Ohio State University and  just help me get connected to the people who were doing design and and what was amazing about getting connected to designers like gun  for example there is a company in Columbus at the time sich it started as Richardson Smith changed its name to fits it was one of the very early design consulting companies one of their claims to fame was the Iomega zip drive  that's funny an anecdote about the zip drive and the jazz drive is that D. V. on the intent behind the names is that they were names that one might name your dog  jazz and so you know when I was in high school and I was lucky to go and spend a month maybe six weeks at Fitch I'm working with a small group of designers there  and that was before I even even went to design school and so you know I really got lucky so many people on end up stumbling into the world of design and I think something that's important for us designers design leaders to do more of is you know share relatable stories about about the field and help more people become aware that it exists and that it's an exciting applied career path for folks besides sharing stories what are other things of this on your computer to like shed light on the fact that the size an interesting opportunity especially for students who are still undecided about what they want to do  I think it's a great question you know your question makes me think of somebody who inspires me who I think is a great designer and also someone who's great at communicating design to a broader audience I'm when I was in grad school in Seattle Washington I was lucky enough to meet a  send named Maurice woods and Maurice had completed his MFA at your job couple years before me  and he started a program called interact project in  and you know with this program he wanted to bring designed to the community and  Maurice I'm he's like six foot seven he's a former professional basketball player he played pro ball in your out and  in my early days in Seattle I I volunteered for interact project and I got to see him first hand talking about design to a group of under privileged middle schoolers and  you know it was really eye opening he was able to connect with the students I'm talking about talking about basketball talking about  sneakers you might be excited about the latest air Jordans you know  you can actually design No shoes that's a career that's a career path you can study industrial design and I went to college at the university of Cincinnati  doc is is what the school is is known by two to to those in the know  and then a part of that program is  required internships so it's actually a five year design course with about a year and a half of internships and a number of the people who I went to design school with went to do internships that Nike adidas under armour companies like that and some were even designing shoes designing sneakers and so you know I think that the the story the exam  ball of mo is a really important story for  for design leaders to keep in mind and in particular how he can see how he can meet people where they are and kind of talk to them on their own terms very says using the lexicon of design that you know we all know but might not be as accessible to regular folks  open with saying that   even designers in our industry don't fully understand  the gravity and and and specialness of the moment for design right now I'm I'm curious what what many when you use the word special what exactly referring to and I'm also  curious about  what role you think design plays in people's lives not just designers laps but  in the human being's life  I'm you know I think that we are  living in a time that is a little bit it can to the  industrial revolution of the twentieth century and a time when there were many many products being manufactured for mass use and when people realize that those those products could be could be designed they didn't have to emulate hand craft of the past  in school I was really fortunate lucky enough to be able to go and visit the the powerhouse in a school that we often learn about when we're studying design and down into the boat house got started in the town and  many called Weimar and it moved to a different location a city called decile and then you know why why is this beautiful town and decile is kind of injury or hit dust real town but the reason why the school moved there was to be close to industry to be close to manufacturing to be close to the technology of the time  that was where I had  jet engines were being manufactured and they wanted to be there with the breakthrough technology so that they could utilize that as they were designing things for people and I think that is the  that is similar to the moment that we're in right now for a digital products I'm you know we depend on digital products to get work done we depend on  spread sheets and documents and calendars we depend on digital products apps  to communicate and share with the people that we love and digital products are part of the the fabric of our everyday life  and  for folks who are you getting started in design and or even for a design schools it's it's not always apparent that things like apps are products of design you know it's easy to think  I mean an apt an act is a diminutive worried it sounds so small and so cute  and apps have been around for a while  well they must be figured out right  and that having worked at a place like Facebook now for about five and a half years there's a lot that still needs figuring out and there's a lot left to design  I'm one of my favorite posters around the office says Sam  the journey is one percent finished and I think that that speaks to just how much work there is yet to be done in the realm of digital products  when you talk about design and Facebook do you emphasize  design or problems solved  you know both product design and problem solving and more broadly are important  I prioritize and deep product design however when talking about design and Facebook  and the reason why I do that is because  the design team here is uniquely positioned to shape the products that people are using every day  and if the designers here don't do that nobody nobody else will  you know we depend on designer is to ensure that our products are well crafted  they're easy for people to use and that they help people solve real problems there really beneficial and and valuable to fox  broader skills like problem solving storytelling empathy those are important  for everybody at Facebook  as you know really it so many people here are involved in making products for people  I am but I tend to emphasize those less because there's something that I expect of the the full community of people here who are who are working on products  do you  do you think designers are responsible for what they create I'll tell you I'm asking I mean we are now sitting in a contentious political environment certainly the most heated in my lifetime  at the center of it is Facebook the news feed  the news feed certainly is  very very powerful at disseminating information  but perhaps the the falsehoods that are permitted the walls a Facebook  have been problematic I wonder what designers of Facebook think about that  you know we take these issues very seriously and the things that we're working on now in fact there are lots of people working on these challenges today are there things that we've been working on for a while also you know we really want to connect people with the stories that they find most meaningful  and we know that people care about getting information that's accurate  and  I can give a a specific example and that's kind of interesting  and sometimes people share stories on Facebook and without having to even read the article they're sharing based on the title alone  and  sometimes those types of shares are the types of shares that  because  sensationalism or polarization  and you know as we learn something like that when we're working deeply on an area like this and we can factor that into how we design news feed because we want news feed to connect people with the most meaningful information and we want  Facebook at large to create a global community of informed and specifically engaged people well  are you looking at building products that help  people that might be stuck in their own political bubbles think a little bit broader because being informed yeah I I hear you on what you're saying people want to be more informed right but there are quite there there are different variations on quality of information and false information is still information so you can still be informed  what is Facebook doing now to make sure that  people are getting access to the right information so a couple of things first there's a lot of work that we are doing to remove and eliminate hoaxes on Facebook and this includes things like better detection up front as well as partnering with third party fact checkers  separate from that there is this question about  you know how how can some  we have a more nuanced understanding of of an issue and that's a very interesting space to design within  and we have learned and in fact research shows that if you present somebody with an article on that opposes the article that they just read it actually doesn't help them to think more broadly about the topic it begets polarization  I'm you can contrast that with  for example I'm getting to know a person a human being as a human being and not just an issue  and and when you get to know somebody as a human being you see many more of the the the the shades of gray and much more of the new ones and so an interesting opportunity for Facebook in the long term might be and helping people to connect with other individuals Adam more human level rather than  simply presenting you know alternate sides of the same issue thruster just   simplify just a little bit me say connect people are more human level you're suggesting that Facebook essentially in this moment could find people with opposing viewpoints and and get them to  B. friend each other online or like what what is that connection look like you know this is an early days area so it's hard to say specifically but if you think about some of the different  things that we formed community a  round you know one example is   sports I'm you know I'm I'm I'm a soccer fan Sameer  and and and and you know there is a community of soccer fans around the world and that community is going to include people who have really different perspectives on different issues but because we have that in common I think it can help for us to be able to connect more and for you know me to be able to hear your point of view more and and vice versa I see so it's finding other things I can get people in the same room and then going from there instead of them standing at opposing sides on one thing excising so cut going deeper into this  to the people side of things  you manage a massive social good initiative with Facebook  I'm curious what is the goal of this initiative like what are you what are you trying to what is the outcome you're seeking and if you can tell us about some of the features of products that come out of this so far  I am doing a lot of work and in the social good space today and  you know I was the head of design at Facebook I I really like to be able to focus and go deep on one or two areas of work at any given point in time  and you know I I don't and review all of the work that happens across the company and I don't even know if I would have the time to be able to do that and you know I try to bring it in great  leader is an empower than with very big areas lots of runaway and to work on important things and that's what enables me to go deep on one or two topics at any given point in time you know in the past I've worked too deeply on a number of different things including for example  helping Facebook work better for people who are new to the internet in emerging markets places like India Mexico or Brazil and a messenger when we saw an opportunity to kind of re boot and a re design and build messenger from the ground up and and what I'm focused on today is social good which fits a little bit more broadly into an  mark has described as our work building social infrastructure to keep people safe  and there's a lot of work in the social good space that I'm really excited about  I've spoken about safety check a number of times before which  is a meaningful product to me at two different levels I think safety check helps people in the world who are faced with a crisis too easily reassure their loved ones that there okay and to feel reassured that their friends and family are okay  but on another level that's a really exciting product to me because  it's a product that  came about in a very organic way at Facebook  the origin stories of safety check are actually a small hackathon in our our tiny office in Tokyo  I'm what I'm excited about most now in the social good space is a build on top of safety check which we just announced two weeks ago  and is called community help so if you're in a crisis the most important thing is to communicate that you're okay and to check in on others  but after that you might really need some help  you might need help you know you might need water you might need shelter you might need food or a whole series of other things and the community health product is designed to meet those needs so for example Jared if you have some water to offer you can do so and I'm coming to the product I've indicated that I'm safe I don't have any water so I'm pretty worried  and Facebook can help facilitate that match  this is a product that was inspired by  talking to real people  you know we put people at the center of everything that we do  and we were talking to people in Chennai India after the floods there a year or two years ago and there were amazing things happening with people coordinating and complex spreadsheets  and you know different resources in order to try to help each other so we want to make that through better design a little bit easier and more scalable and more accessible to the number of crises that people face each year so the turn I floods is this an example where did you guys decide to send people to India and and experience the the chaos and  I guess be a bit of a an observer  is that is that the process used there or did you wait until everything was kind of cleared out to figure out  how Facebook it played a part we we did some work to understand has things were unfolding  and but we did a lot of work in the follow up research afterwards to you and to see because afterwards you can you can talk to people and understand what what really works and not just what's what's happening what's emerging and so it was very important to get that   after the fact kind of kind of perspective in input  given your position and Facebook  the could be seen in a positive sense  as signaling  when you pick something to focus your time when you're speaking about earlier there many initiatives and from time to time you try to focus on one or two right I'm so really curious why you chose social good now like what what drew you to that is something that should double down on  so what excited me about that area is a few different things one  was the change from when I was working on before  and that you know before joining Facebook I worked at I DO and one of the biggest things that I learned that idea was that it's great to try new things you never really know what thing you're gonna love  so social good was new and it was different from messenger  I also like to really work in areas where design is a little bit more nascent so this was a new area and there were there was no team it needed to be created from scratch and that's the type of problem that I I personally get really excited about and then thirdly and the the the the mission behind the work keeping people safe is one that that I find to be very very meaningful and I think that there's a lot that Facebook can uniquely do in order to to help you mention I DO I'm also curious about that transition to write like I DO the works that tends to come up and there's more blue sky and higher level thinking  more extract the some sense and when you came to Facebook you came to the group team I believe and growth at the time was also pretty knew what was in a similar story like what exactly attracted you to go from ideals to a Facebook working on growth that was such a new conference here more particular because growth is about yeah the smaller details right it's about it's about buttons and colors and positioning and copy that is yeah it's very interesting what cell Latin  no it is interesting to reflect on this I'm  I was really nervous when when coming  Facebook man you know I didn't I didn't know how how I would sit in or if I would fit and I also wasn't I wasn't looking and then one day received an email from from mark Zuckerberg  you know Hey look we're trying to build a great design team here at Facebook  okay  this is an unusual day yeah I'm  so I talked with him on the phone and learned a little bit more about what he was trying to accomplish and got to know him a little bit more and  you know I wasn't joining Facebook as a as a as a senior level person to lead something big I was joining as a product designer  and I didn't know what I would come and work on and  and it's it's pretty incredible de and  degree to which mark  values and understands the value of design that he would call up on the phone you know random designer who who might be interested in in coming to Facebook  I came in and   I started engineering boot camp  and that was a little bit of a shock and  in fact I kind of a drop down during drifted away from engineering boot camp in order to help out with some things that seemed like they were problems that needed helping with at the time  we had just announced  time line we had just announced some changes to news feed with just announced a product called taker  the design team was maybe in the neighborhood of three dozen people and then there was one design critique a week for three thousand people  and we we could barely squeeze into the biggest conference room in the building  and you know I just wanted to roll up my sleeves and help with these different challenges  how can we make a product like ticker I work better for people how can we modify critique such that it will be done it would work at the scale of the design team that  I'm so I just kind of got started working on things  I did a hackathon on my very first hackathon  working with a a a a a great group and  we designed and built a small feature for Facebook which enables you to save the post save an article  which is the thing on Facebook today and just a few months ago we we released a similar feature on Instagram  I  maybe about like six months in at Facebook  I was interested in shifting to become a manager and  when talking about this and they think the growth team stood out as an area that I was interested in and  I was interested in the growth team because  I remembered their talk from orientation  and I remember it learning more and not talk than in any other talk  I remember coming away from not talk thinking less about my own personal experience with Facebook and more about some of the challenges that people around the world we're facing as they tried to use Facebook challenges like I'm you know what would it be like to be trying to sign up for Facebook to be required to have an email in order to sign up for Facebook and do not have or not know what an email  and so on so  I I felt like I learned a lot from that one talk probably one hour and  you know leaning on my my biggest take away from from I DO try new and different things I said I'm interested in growth let's go and figure this out  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work  here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users that's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  of course we're inspired by our design program which is over sixty years old  today IBM employs more than one thousand three hundred professional designers and we've sort of  five more than sixty thousand IBM verse in the practices of IBM design thinking  the result  divers teams working more closely than ever with our clients their users and our partners to create modern solutions   provide differentiated human centered outcomes to the world we'd love to share the story more closely with you  and I hope to see you soon at one of our IBM studios worldwide  we'd also like to thank our friends envision for their support invasion is the world's leading product design platform power in the future of digital design to their understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One Netflix Airbnb  I work with remote things all the time I found the keeping a healthy dialogue is really important without it building strong work relationships gets a lot harder and that leads to poor collaboration  I've also found the prototypes are great way for me to show my full vision for design and this helps cut down a lot of back and forth  invision makes all this really easy you can rack in the prototype  designs and collaborate across every stage of your project taking your ideas from concept to code it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration of core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers developers and writers  teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when the using vision suite of prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit envision out dot com slash hi res  three months  right so mark reached out to you in two thousand eleven  this is a year before the IPO which means he was busy was well in it and he reached out to a product designer out of idea why is that did he know you will be seeing you  you know I think that ten mark reaching out is  is is a reflection of of how much he values design and I think one of the top priorities for Facebook in two thousand eleven two thousand and twelve was  scaling the design team and creating a really strong design foundation to support the future scale of Facebook  and   I'm when I when I was in Seattle  in grad school at you dub me in a very city of Washington I'm my my gig was TA in different early design classes  and  in one of those classes or maybe two I had a couple of students who were particularly talented bunch  one ended up  getting an internship at Facebook  in fact I think that his plan was to get hired by Facebook and drop out of school and if things had gone according to plan we probably wouldn't have even that went  but they didn't go quite according to plan he ended up with an internship instead of a full  find a job and then return internship and then he started working at Facebook after  after school  and that was at a point in time where the Facebook design team was very small like as a guest maybe a dozen people  and I'm that was at a point in time where there was a very high technical bar for a designer is that Facebook designers were expected to design but also to be production level friend and engineers  and then  this individual true and he helped to open up Facebook's and brought in Facebook's definition of design and that started to pull in a few talented designers who he knew and then he pulled in one two three he helped to pull in me so I think true is another part of the the the story right   I mean the it's funny because I think that that speaks to something that drew me to Facebook and Facebook is all about people connecting about communication and I'm that is the way that so many things get done you know were it not for I'm  our broad communication technology  true and I never would have connected never would have made the connection back here  that's not the type of thing that one is likely to achieve throughout  you know working on that John  application tool or something like that that's a little bit more narrow in focus so coming back to your journey to the grill team baseball   that was very interesting time I suppose like it was still pretty new concept what works some new  things were discovered or created as far as your design process and how you thought about problems  I'm there a few big things one is that I'm I learned a lot and in the early days on the gross team about designing for people who aren't like you  and I mentioned the example of somebody on signing up for Facebook for the first time on their phone without have have an email address or even having heard of an email address what is this  and that's a pretty amazing experience I mean that's that's what I would do I DO as well but  I could get much deeper into it in the context of a Facebook in Facebook's global community of users  so that's one huge learning and huge huge kind of take away from my early days on growth and another is sign  another is the importance of the data in designing products today  you know when you're designing for somebody who is really not like you it's hard to know what works  and so we can use data in order to understand you know is this really working for somebody is this  making it simpler for them to sign up and confirm their account on Facebook and or or or isn't it maybe it was a good idea but maybe it's not working maybe it's not quite working yet  and  I'm those warnings have informed on all of the work that I've done subsequently I think that data is one of the the best tools for a designer is today and it's a special tool that enables us to understand are the products were making really working for people I would also argue data is probably one of the most misunderstood  hill's corps or tools for designer right  some people when they hear data they think it's cannibalizing their creativity like they don't  I can't do anything anymore because datasets axe or the is so it's B. R. and  what are some things there's actually keep in mind when they're actually thinking about applying data to their design process and how should they actually approach it if they want to turn around and try this tomorrow  on one of the best pieces of advice that I could give is to and start your design process with data you know I'm as you are are thinking about and what might be it's great to talk to people to do user research to get maybe a descriptive analysis about how the product is working for people today  I'm to spend some time to just understand I'm and really really understand the area that you're working in  and sometimes up front in the data it  and help you to identify a special opportunity for design so  I'd encourage designers to start early thinking about data and you said I was there as they're identifying where the design opportunities might be  I also encourage designers to just be be open I'm D. are you know data enables us to be a step more empirical in understanding what works so  don't be too attached to the thing that you're making on because you don't know necessarily whether it's going to work or not and that's okay it's that's okay it's a part of the process and maybe lastly I'd say I I think it's great for a designer is to   to learn about data and learn enough about it to  to be able to  asking good questions learn enough about it to be able to identify when the data might be fishy maybe this isn't actually accurate or or maybe  maybe this isn't the data that matters  maybe it's something else that does  so you moved on from growth how long we in growth how many how many years or months were you on the grill team  hi  hi I worked directly on growing Facebook for maybe a couple years couple years okay so you had a couple of years of experience of growth on under your belt then you were put in charge of messenger from my understanding is that right you you let the design on the messenger team you you build the design teams   messenger  how is it different than what how are the two teams operating differently and and what did you bring from growth to the messenger team I'm  so L. messenger was a really exciting opportunity and it was exciting because   a couple of different threads were coming together and  one thread was that one of the designers and very talented designer who was working with me on growth at the time I was just interested in messenger and and was thinking about some of the problems that messenger was trying to solve and how they were inhibited by building messaging within the main Facebook app and so he started tinkering and  putting together a son and son designed some some actually very sophisticated demos  that showed what it could be like to to have a dedicated and standalone messenger app  and that kind of coincided with sun abroad and a strategic understanding at at the time  as we   as we try to get a sense of  what mattered for people I'm in a messaging product and the things that matter are things like you know getting really fast responses from the people who your messaging finding people right yeah right exactly and so on  so these different threads were coming together V.  kind of broad strategic top down understanding  the bottom up tinkering and designing and imagining what this product could be like and myself and a number of people shift our attention from growing Facebook toward  this different  different opportunity different problem space messenger and actually we we applied a lot of the same types of thinking and the same learnings that we had from the growth space but of course the the  that the problem was a little bit different  recreating kind of rebooting a whole new apps versus  helping somebody in India sign up for Facebook on their phone what were some other principles on the on the go team that you brought to messenger so I I understand that designing for people that don't look like you or live like you is a big one   what else iterating fast maybe is that sold V. I. N.  at one other thing that I think is worth mentioning is that is is process and and there isn't a standard process at Facebook you know different groups different people have the autonomy to define the process that they believe is going to set them up for success in achieving their goals and mission  on the the folks on growth have a have a more   a more refined process though that is one that that I really like and then that I believed in and and the process is simple  understand identify  execute  and I think it's a really special process and take the time to understand things before you get started making them you know I'm with the understanding that you have identify what is the biggest opportunity what are the most important problems to solve  I'm and I'm and then after you have that figured out you know execute you don't have to worry about the rest just focus on getting it done and making it real  I'm not the process that we employed on messenger and that's a process that I like to utilize  in a whole range of different time challenges and opportunities that come up saw some so poor design teams were watching this listening and we're in the middle of stealing their own design teams are on Facebook I believe the design work is in the hundreds  four hundred  plus we don't release the number after signers of seven oaks working on on anything in particular but I think hundreds this fan so in a hundred so thinking about teams or in the tens right around the ones right now yeah  looking back on how Facebook groups son organization what are some lessons that they can take away on how the scale not only just like getting the number of people within their team  but their process other design language especially this stuff yeah I think one of the most important things for a team as they're scaling especially a small team is having the willingness to let go of things  what I really like all of them and because you have  to be willing to let go of big and important and exciting things in order to bring in the types of leaders that you're gonna need to depend on as you scale because before you know it they'll be more more work and more things than you can personally and individually attend to I think that that's the number one thing for me actually is on be willing to give things away  because you need to do that in order to get great people and there are other things as well so  you know one thing that has worked  I think quite well at Facebook is that we built up a program inspired by engineering boot camp which all engineers go through when they get started here  that we call design camp  and design camp is something that if you were starting at Facebook as a designer you would go through design camp for your first couple weeks and  that is a point in time where we can describe the context of Facebook we can  help you to  I'd have sun  techniques that might set you up for success we can explain our design philosophy and give you exposure to different design tools and so forth  and  as a team is growing quickly and you can reach a huge  portion of the design community by focusing on new people as they're coming in  another thing that has helped us to scale that's less in the in the people space that's a little bit more in the products space is  we call Stig the Facebook interface guidelines  and I think it is something that started in several years back and  we wanted to create something that was a true to the way that Facebook works  the way Facebook works is you know lots of different people different groups who have lots of autonomy no top down process and  so  so we can set about to create  components are built in code that designers and product teams could could use and are thinking was that it would be easier for a designer and for their team to grab this pre built component that has a whole bunch of things figured out that it would be to design something from scratch  and that would enable designers to focus on  identifying what are the unique problems that they need to solve  in what they're working on and put the majority of their design attention toward those unique problems  rather than you know bothering their energy a crossed every aspect of the design that's interesting you earlier you mentioned   the willingness to give something up to give things up I'm curious if you can give us an example something you gave up yeah I  think a an interesting example of that is on internet dot org in  internet dot org is a really big mission really exciting bringing people online I'm  it's it's a it's amazing and and I was taken aback when when mark said let's do this it just seems so big  and that's an area with a a where we were building up the design team from scratch it's an exciting problem if it's something that's really meaningful and and that that's something that instead of saying you know I want to roll up my sleeves and get involved in that I said you know I've been to one of the people on my team this might be a cool opportunity for you  and they've built up an incredible design team that's focused on internet dot org and is doing really amazing work that's that's not often seen by  folks like us here in California   and there are there are there are other examples as well you're when you're when you're meeting with mark or any of the other board members or people in the C. suite  what perspective they expect you to bring  to those meetings now  one of the things that Cheryl says on that resonates with me deeply is that time you should bring your whole self to work on and I'm so when I bring my whole self to work and that includes the part of me that's a designer I'm and so  you know I'm mark or Cheryl could expect me to bring a design perspective to bear on a given topic sure  how we could craft something better or how we can make something work better for people and but  but there are other aspects to who I am as well right you know I grew up in the Midwest  I'm kind of a quiet person I like to I like to listen and take a lot of things in and then and then kind of summarized back to people and I'm I'm an introvert mean we have we have posters around that say you know move fast I kind of feel like I'm a smoker  and so you know in that context I I bring my whole self which includes all these other aspects not to last me as a designer  what do you think the role of the designer is today  I think that tell our the role of of a designer today is  is focused on shaping products making things that people use I'm  there's a really interesting  exhibition right now in Kanazawa Japan that is about the line between craft and design  and  I think the difference between craft and design is is in part the scale you know when you design something you're deciding it to be used by many people many people who aren't you  and another a difference between design and craft is  typically that you depend on more people than just yourself to make something I'm  and the  I'm so design is all about making things where you need help from others to make it and you you hope that people beyond just you will be able to use it  I really like these kind of applied pragmatically practical definitions of design and what designers do and I also believe that things like storytelling and problem solving and empathy are important aspects of design but it's okay that fundamentally what we do is shaped the products that people use  and thinking a little bit ahead now for this honor  things like virtual reality artificial intelligence on kind of computing are finally getting kommer consumer rights  and  becoming a little bit more human like  in the future do you think we're going to come to think of these things as humans  and whatever your opinion is around that  how do you think that's going to influence the way designers actually designed for the system's going forward  you know it's hard for me to say if and when we might start to think of technology I'm in the way that we think of of of humans and what we really do here is put people at the center of everything that we do  but that doesn't mean that technology isn't an important part  and it makes me think of a at at at at  I am a few months back when our head of sound design I came up to me and he said Hey look I wanted to come and check out this thing  and so I put on the oculus had sat and he proceeded to take off  and fly around and and all the stuff and I said okay well that's that's pretty cool you know what's  what's to do here and  and and and and will said okay now now try this version and so he gave me a different had sent and I put it on and then took the same trip but  it was much much more life like  it was totally different  it felt like an as I turn my head you know I could hear the engine behind me and the difference was that and there was spatial audio in the second version rather than the first  and that's a really cool break through we on we we we actually announced and released this yesterday so that people can  incorporate spatial audio into their virtual reality or three hundred sixty degree videos and I think that showcases the way that technology moves on there are always different breakthroughs those breakthroughs are and really exciting for us designers because they they provide us with new opportunities but  but I think that in that example it also shows that people are at the center because that's all about making the experience for the the actor  much more realistic and lifelike as you look past your last five and a half years here  you look at your entire body of work you think of how much you personally grown there are probably thousands of product design and you start as a product designer Facebook you are now five years later the head of design at Facebook in their product is on out designers out there wondering what was his journey what with the skills that Luke emphasized that brought him into a position to be able to now manage this big team and all of these fundamentally different yet super connected products what were some of the skills and and and and  growth for you you know I think I was really lucky I think I was lucky I had to be at a company like Facebook that was at a very high growth a point in time and and I I feel very fortunate for those opportunities that were in front of me  I think that  there are a few different things that helped and one thing that helped is I'm  putting others first  this is the notion that time  the   business school professor Adam grant writes about man from time to time the notion that there are people who are giver is people who are takers and people who are not terrorists  and I'm  you know when I came to the Facebook I just tried to give as much as I could  and to do what was right for all of the people who are using the product do what was right for Facebook  I do what was right for the design community at Facebook and put myself at the bottom of the list and   and I think that the focus on  what's best for the community of people who use Facebook what's best for the company I think that those are the values and attitudes that helped me to get to where I am today do you think there are responsibilities  that designer should be paying attention to today that could  that maybe they're ignoring to their own detriment that could actually help   them up inside of their own companies help them grow and put you in as a put them on a similar trajectory as yourself you know I think one of the most important skill sets for a designer is is to   understand the context that they're operating within  you know understand of what a given company's values are understand where the company is trying to go understand what the company is all about and if you can do that then you can frame all the work that your doing as a designer in those terms and in that language that everybody's gonna understand  I'm and I think that sometimes designer is  can end up stuck in the world of design  and and get too deeply into you know some particular facet of the design that they're working on  I mean I I was having dinner with a  with the C. a few years back and  he said something that time  he said he said designers are like cats you just have to give them a ball of yarn  play with it  that's brutal it's brutal but on but there is some truth to that you know sometimes it does happen that a designer you can end up focused you know a little bit more on their portfolio piece than on and what's really going to be an important contribution  reminds me of the process you spoke about earlier understand identify execute oftentimes we get too caught up in a lot of  sure going to community corrections all right or in the last segment here we're making it okay so  we reach out to our community and we asked them what matters the most with burning up inside them and they give us five questions that meant a great crew and I love that you're doing that yeah this is this is fun okay so when we're we're asking everyone this by the way so how should designers explain the role of designed to people in their business  I'm I think it's it's a past for designer is  to  focus on explaining the role of design through concrete examples the best examples will come from within the organization that you're you're a part of so and if you want to and showcase are more broadly communicate the value of design in your organization  I think you should identify maybe a hero case for design and a a time where design really made a difference for something that matters to the company  and make sure to tell that story you know we improved the registration experience for people on Facebook and it made it much easier for people to confirm their accounts and now many more people are on Facebook because we made it easier  and and that type of hero case hero example it's almost self evident  there's no question about the value of design it's it's it's obvious that it's there  and you might have that here  case already and you just need to communicated and frame it in that way or if you're just getting started and you don't have that here  case you know look out for what that might be the second question is how was the design team at Facebook organized  I'm the way that we organize products at Facebook is that we have lots of small teams and each small team has  has a lot of autonomy and responsibility for the area that they work on  so  this book is a big company and high growth company and but you might find yourself here working with a handful of engineers maybe one other designer couple of data people one project one product manager and you might find yourself in a very small group it might feel a lot like a start up but building on top of the Facebook platform in Facebook infrastructure rather than a start up building from scratch in the market and  so that's really how we organize and we think of their as being a few different pillars of product development these include product design data  engineering and product management and there's also a suite of other teams and disciplines that time are involved in shaping product like content strategy sound design research product marketing at cetera  so  for a given initiative we tried to assemble a team a great team a small team that can internalize the purpose of the work the goal that they're trying to achieve and can chart a course to do so  the next question is when you're the only designer and a company your far cry from that I get it but when you're the only designer in the company how do you convince the leadership in the company of the value that design brings you know being the only designer in a company is a unique situation I think it's a unique talent it's it's tough to be by yourself and it's also kind of a a cool opportunity because there's lots of room to grow from one  I think how to convince people of the value of design is going to depend a little bit on the organization itself and what the organization is all about  I'm one thing that I did when I was getting started on growth that  I think work well that's maybe a small tip that that folks might  fifty eight is on  I am I give a book to my manager and the book that I gave to my manager at the time was on a book called the universal principles of design  and I chose that book very carefully  I chose that book because it's very accessible  it's very simple it's like fifty a hundred different examples one page at a time of different ways that design could add value  and then I have and you know  I don't know if you read the whole book or not but I know that he at least read a few of the examples because they they became fodder for future conversation while  and   US so I'm not might be that might be a small thing sure  next question is how should designers measure and present results of their work  measurement on the results of of one's work are really important things but I question a little bit weather designers are the ones who should be measuring their results of their work you know designers aren't necessarily neutral in that case nor are we necessarily experts in data and understanding things so I mean it would be great to have somebody who's depth is data and understanding to be  there to talk about and describe and define whether this is working or isn't working  and I think it's important to do so in a in a really   neutral a really empirical kind of way  I think that you could run into lots of problems if you try to cherry pick something that's working well or I'm kind of over a cell  so we get in with this final question  as the function of design continues to evolve as a has been  what are some roles are methodologies that you think might emerge over the next five years  over the next five years I think I actually think that we will continue to see digital products focused on people  at at the forefront I'm and I hope that over the next five years we'll see more people more designers today get involved in design of digital products I hope that we'll see more people at large get into design and into  the design of digital products I hope that we'll see a more diverse community of people get into design you know there was something there was a study a week or two ago that was released that I was looking at  Terence subsidizing the income of twenty somethings in in urban environments and of course the discipline that's at the top of the list of parents subsidies is the arts  and then I think that that is something that can not something that can really change if more people get involved in applied product design and a special  so we have digital products on the technology will change it always does  we'll have more lifelike more realistic and experiences that are possible the band with  will increase and   audio and other types of things will be more important  but I think that fundamentally one of the constants for design will be that we're shaping the products and that we're putting people first  well look thank you

       " \"hi everyone so I know this is probably a huge cliche  since probably ever seen every single speaker says this but it's a huge honor to be here  I was sitting in your seats about ten years ago which seems like not that long and yet quite a long time we just celebrated our of my my class the class of those six to celebrate our ten year reunion here like a couple months ago which is a lot of fun so it's really really great to be here  I remember when I was sitting in your seats and you know I had just come from Texas that's where I was raised and you know I've done some web design in the past but I didn't really know anything about Silicon Valley know anything about you know this kind of tech hub and what it means to like have a career here and start ups and all that prior to coming to Stanford and I remember you know sitting in the audience and listening to the stories of people who had kinda come before me and in particular you know Marissa Mayer and Jen Fitzpatrick and they stand up here and they would talk about kind of their adventures after leaving Stanford and all of the great things that they got to go and build and work on and I was just like wow this is super super exciting and you know now I'm excited to be here talking to all of you guys and  hopefully sharing a couple fun stories along the way   so down as you guys heard I as as here I did my computer science degree my bachelors and my masters  and I was also lucky enough to be a part of the Mayfield those program so how do you guys know about the Mayfield  okay so for those of you who don't know  this is an awesome program that  that is really about diving into entrepreneurship and SO one part of the program is that between you know your junior your senior year you go and get an internship with a start up somewhere in the valley  and you know along the way we are as we're in turning out our respective companies were learning about entrepreneurship we're taking classes were doing case studies and  it's it's fabulous it's it's awesome sought by Tina  I a lot of fun doing it so I the time of the start of that I chose was actually Facebook and you know this is a little bit of a little the little cheating because in two thousand six  Facebook was already about a hundred people so it was a start up but on the larger and of a start up and  you know but it was something I was really excited to work on because it was a product that I and all of my classmates at the time you know used very religiously so I went there and I remember my first day at Facebook in fact  I was signed up to be an engineer and work on you know some of the photos features and I had a mentor and her name is Richie at on the first day she said okay there's been a change of plans I'm switching jobs I'm not gonna be engineer anymore I'm gonna be a PM I don't really know what that means for you  but let me you know introduce you to this part of people over here you know this is our design team why don't you sit with them and and you know like chat with them I've got to go run and so she left being in this pod with this group of designers and before that you know I I'm not a designer by trade I didn't really know anything  about design   but I got to talking to these people and you know I sat about Paul I'd and lo and behold you know fast for ten years and and now it you know my careers in design and when I look back on it sort of seems really quite random how it happened  but for me what was so exciting about design was the the chance to work in the front forefront and thinking about you know what are the people who are going through the experience that we're building what are they feeling what are they thinking you know how are they  able to understand the products that we built and so to me that was what was super super  fascinated about design and also wasn't that crazy because at the time you know the designers that we hired were also our front end engineering team so it's a little bit of both designing and a little bit of coding is back in the world where you know we were still operating with just websites so you just had to you know to some CSS and Java script and front page be and it wasn't nearly as complicated of an ecosystem as it is today   but we got to building and one of the first things I worked on was of photos and photo products I also remember one of my  first big launches a couple months later which was news feed  back in September of two thousand and six  over the years I've worked on things like the Facebook platform  and ushering in a bunch of applications built on top of Facebook  including you know a lot of games  back in the error of two thousand eight and two thousand nine I worked on profile and timeline to  and I worked on you speed and today the team that I lead a we work on design for all of the core features of the Facebook application  so when you go on Facebook and you want to catch up with their friends you wanna share you wanna you know watch videos or you know join a group those are a lot of the things that  my my team works on  so all that's sad that's a little bit of a intro into to kind of how how like I hear the thing that I I think has been the most fascinating for me as I have you know look back on all the things I worked on is you know the moment where and you're starting a project and you are thinking about you know here's this awesome new idea that I have I can imagine you know how it's going to work and how people are going to use it and I want to build it right now and you know you rally a bunch of other people together with you and you guys are all excited about this idea that's how everything happens right that's how any idea ever sees the light of day  the question that I found super fascinating is how do we know at that point in time whether this is an idea that's going to be successful how do we know at after it you know it's all set done and we worked our our nights and weekends and we've gotten out to the world that will actually be something that people find valuable and that they'll find it easy to use and that they'll find well crafted  and you know being out Facebook we've had our share of features  some of them have gone on to be a great success and some of them that haven't and a lot of times at the beginning you know there's there's it feels like there's really no way to tell feels like you're you're kind of rolling the dice little bit and this is the thing that I wanted to really study and and you know kind of reflect on over you know all of the different products that we built  is what we're  the patterns for the things that were successful are there ways that we can tell as we are building whether this is something that's that's going to work or not  and  what came out of that you know and a lot of discussions and a lot of post war and that a lot of just looking at the things that we had built was a framework  of just three simple questions at Facebook  that we now use to to ask ourselves whether the things that we're building feel like that there on  and there are three very simple questions  because you know it wasn't going to be a manual that everybody was going to memorize and understand what is three questions that we wanted everyone at Facebook you no matter what their role was or what they worked on whether there were engineers are designers are product managers to keep in mind and you know when they're having a team meeting or whether we're reviewing the product or whether you know they're actually just talking with a colleague about an idea to just think of these three questions and ask them and to make sure that we have really really good answers to these questions so that's what I'm gonna talk with you guys about today  so the first question is is the most basic and the question is what people problem are we trying to solve  and the key word here is is really the word people because of course whenever we build anything we're trying to solve the problem  but what tends to happen is that you start to think in the mentality of your team or your company and you started to say things like you know the problem we need to solve is that we need to optimize the click through rate of our page and  you know you'll hear things like this all the time you know fall down and and small ways and in large ways and that that's not a people problem a people problem as we define it is with the go out and you talk to someone on the street and they were to articulate a problem that they were having  that's how they would say it you know that is the people problem statement  there's there's a couple things that we look at to make sure that you know this is a valid people problem statement the first is that it needs to be  human and straight forward so we're not using words like CTR we're not using words like optimize or you know it integrate like these are not words that people on the street with news you know these are not words that people who are outside of the tech community are going to use to talk about their problems  the second thing is we want to make sure that IT solutions and gnostic a lot of times we start problems by saying I am going to build it after that blank or I'm going to design a website that blank and already in that statement is is it inkling of what the solution is but what if you know it apps not the right way or what if it's not supposed to be a website so a good people problem statement gets away from you know trying to already constrained it into a particular solution  the third thing is that it it shouldn't be about you know  you know we'll Facebook or your company or your team or whatever winning and I think classic example is if you say you know our service is going to be the best at blah blah blah a person on the street doesn't care of your service is  the one that is the best at that they just want to know Hey for this problem that I have what is the best solution so stating any problem as like we you know our team our company whatever wants to win is is not getting close to to the things that people actually want  the first thing is that it gets out the why so you know sometimes you might have a problem like people aren't you know  discovering this page and that is a problem that when yourself but it doesn't go one layer deeper it doesn't get out well why you know what's what's actually the root cause of why people are discovering this page is it to hidden for them is it too confusing for them to find like you've got to get you know to not just what is happening but what is the reason why it's happening  and finally a good people problem statement can not just you know solve functional problems like like a confusing flow but could also get out emotional or social problems sometimes people just want to feel like they belong sometimes people just want to feel like they're validated those are things that also constitutes you know  something that that that when you ask people they might they might say  so let's look at some examples  so earlier this year I had the privilege of attending the  mom's two point oh summit and this is a a gathering of a lot of influential bloggers and   journalist who you know  our mothers and who talk about you know parenthood and those topics  and so I got a chance to meet a lot of the attendees and be on a panel with with some of them  and one of the things that are heard over and over again  was was basically this and this is an example to me of a people problem statement  I want to talk about an interest with other people who are also interested but I don't know where to find them and this is especially relevant at this conference because a lot of times what would happen is you know you're a new mom and  baby you know you're in your front in your friend group nobody else is having babies around the same time as you but the same time you know there's so many things that goes through your mind you want to know it like is this normal My Baby just did this like should I be worried if you know what are some resources you you want to have like a community of other new moms to be able to talk to and so a lot of times you know women  will will not know exactly where to find though that community and if they're lucky you know friends or other people say Hey there's you know a local  you know group group here or there's like a neighborhood moms group but this is something that a lot of people in the audience were we're talking about a something that that was a problem to them so this is an example of a people problem statement  here's another example this one we've heard over and over again  ever since we introduced the like button on Facebook everybody would ask why don't you guys have a dislike button and that would be one of the the top most requests that we've had for for years and years but you know that's not really a people problem statement at that sort of just a suggestion of we dig deeper the reason why people wanted a dislike button is frankly because not everything and new speed is likable you know people write about of hard times that they're going through tragedies that are happening  and their live  in a recently we just went through the selection which was a very very charged and you know people would read things or say things that made them feel a lot of different emotions not just happy once and so that is basically the people problem statement  not everything in the seat is like a ball and I want to be able to easily express other things  and finally one more example  so sometimes you know I call these people problem statements sometimes are not just problems in the way of like Hey you know someone going to bring this up as as like a hardship in their life that they want solved sometimes is just more of an opportunity or a thing that you know if you ask people if they wanted they would say yes   an example here is the the and the desire to share spontaneously and authentically right a lot of times we're going through you know a pretty cool experience and we might capture it at that moment and then an hour later grow and uploaded on Facebook but you know how cool would it be to actually had that experience live with our friends and our family  so that is an example of another people problem statement  so basically you know the first the first thing that we always ask is okay is do we have like a statement that is really about what problem we're trying to solve for people that's the first question  so now the second question is  well how do we know this is a real problem  and by no I mean well what evidence do we have right is there a qualitative evidence that it is Sir quantitative evidence that we can look at and I highlight the word we all not because you know I think that they're like fake problems but but just because you know I think the  and to ask is is this a problem that is worth solving you know all of us have  limited time energy resources money whatever to be able to to vote you know are are being into trying to solve problems what makes this one the one that we should pick out of thousands or millions of problems that are out there  and so this question is really about just making sure that the opportunity  is is is something that is worth tackling and that we aren't just you know solving problems for ourselves individually but that we actually are are very  aware of the problems that the audience that we're building for spacing  so for the example of groups you know I want to talk about  I want to find other people who are interested in discussing the same things as I am  the way that we've tried to validate whether or not this was a big enough use case was of course we went and  we   talked to a lot of people but we also look at some of the data that we had so when we designed the group's product  to start with we imagine that most of the time you know you would get invited to the group so I might start a book club and I'm going to invite some of my friends who like reading the same books as me and they know that that's how that's how we're all gonna know about the group so in our initial formulation of group that was really all about you know being invited to  by somebody else who is already a part of this group  but one of the things actually that  that some of the engineers on our on the group's team had hopped over the years with this little units called groups you should join in and so do some of you guys want to see that sometimes you are scrolling through your feed and you know this little  story will pop up and it based on you know what your friends have joined and groups in your community and  groups are similar to things that we think you might be interested in you'll see some recommendations  and and you know you can go in and explore them and decide to join them if you want  and you know we thought that this is just a small feature but really you know most of the inviting was gonna happen through  you know the normal in by process only took a look at the data what we found was that actually a third that you know of of  group memberships were starting to happen via this little groups you should join it which meant that there actually was a need and a desire  already using this the tools that we currently had that people wanted to find things that they weren't explicitly being invited to that there were examples of all sorts of things that they wanted to be able to participated and see that they just weren't getting connected to any other way so this was I think good evidence for us that if we wanted to devote something you know a a larger solution to helping people discover groups that that was a worthwhile endeavor  we also talked to a lot of people  a lot of different groups  one of the the the folks who talk to reference this group called the fifth position moms group  this is actually a S. one of the most active groups on Facebook and I I think something like one out of four doctors who are mothers in America are part of this group  and one of my friends actually happens to be a doctor who  just had a baby and so you know she was like enough to have  one of her colleagues Attar to this group but she talked about how  meeting for was to her and she  she would spend hours on this group every single week  because you know these doctor moms would be sharing tips on on a kind of how to balance their work and and you know I had a  really tackle a lot of the issues that come from being in that profession and this is an example of you know a group that that everyone who is a part of it finds a hugely meaningful but not everyone knows about it because like how would you know that that this thing even existed out in the world unless somebody told you  another example is  you know I've recently you know attended our our ten year reunion and at the reunion I think a lot of people are using groups to coordinate events and meet ups and  the biggest barrier is that like half of the people I talked to didn't know that these groups existed that there was you know a class of two thousand and six group and that there was a reunion group that there were you know groups for different  dorms and who are planning their get togethers  and  finally you know there are a lot of groups and I'm I'm a designer and one of the the top groups  that a lot of designers in the community joined as this group called designers killed a lot of designers share tools and articles at the bread and other resources and every time you know I I happen to add someone because I thought about them is that you know that they might enjoy it they're always like wow I didn't know about this like that's the first thing that everyone I says I didn't know about this so all of this you know when we did our focus groups in our research we I was more evidence that that in fact we should be doing more to to help people discover groups  so we ended up doing was actually building a pretty simple discover feature   if you go to your groups tab  right next to it they'll be a town called discover and you know we did our research on what we're kind what were the topics that people were most interested in so you can scroll through  you'll see suggestions based on things that that you're ready are part of but then you also be able to go and browse by category and this is where you can find you know parenting groups us your photographer people to go  you know on a photo ID trips with on the weekends or play sports with or you know joining a running group and these are all groups that are public  and that actually want to welcome new members  for the people problem of not everything that I see a new speed is likable and I want to be able to express you know other  motions we wanted to make sure that this is actually a problem that that you know many people faced in that you know the solution that we had would actually directly addresses  so we looked at you know  we talked to a lot of users  we had them go through their fees and describe to us you know for each story  what with what was your reaction or the feeling you know sort of like a free flow  tell tell us what's going through their minds as they're going to they're feats and you know a lot of times people would say well there should be more ways for me to just say something because what I like about the like button is that it's so simple and no I don't have to you know  go in common and the keyboard comes up and have to like you know two handed the type something I like the fact that I can just  in one Chester kind of scroll through things and then you know say that I like it but the only thing I can do is like and there's got to be you know other other ways for me to express  other motions  we also looked at up your whole help you how are people you know using how are people expressing that they don't like something today and we looked at  the stickers that people are using and leaving us comments as well as the emoji and what we're kind of the most popular ones for you know how frequently were people just leaving a simple sticker or a simple emoji  and finally we looked at also short comments so we looked at how many comments were just one or two words and all they expressed was like awesome or like that sucks or you know a a very very short phrase that we felt we couldn't in caps like  so with all that  you know we decided  we looked at all the data we looked at were the most common emotions that people want to express and we just we design something that we felt was  is sort of fulfilled that criteria being really really light weight so you can still do it at with one hand  and one Chester it's not like multiple taps and we also you know taking all of the data that that we had gotten from what were the most common things that people in  the common reactions that they had we we just we built  the reactions product and so you just scroll through and  we took the the top most  what we can wanted it to be universal reactions and that are that's the options that you see in that tree  and finally for the people problem of I want to share spontaneously authentically in the moment  this was interesting to us because you know we had the Facebook live product  out for celebrities and we built it for celebrities and public  yours first because we talk to them that was something that they told us very directly that they wanted and it was something that they were used to because you know they live their lives in the spotlights and they're they're very used to going on to the red carpet and doing interviews and you know being broadcast live and it was something that they felt they could do to kind of connect with their fans a little bit more so this is something that we had out that you know they  that that was that was only available to public figures  but what the interesting insight for us was well is this something that that that people one who are public figures you know as a something that  people in the audience you guys me you know all of us  would this be something that that non public figures would use and find valuable and that is the question that we set out to try and and  on cover improve actually one of the easiest ways  for us to do that  was the you know just build it for ourselves you know we already had the code at that ran for a public figures and we just turned it on and we you know it's let's see if anybody at the office uses it and  what their reactions were  and we saw actually a lot of really creative ways in which people used it  some people use it to broadcaster team meetings  you know for people who are like working from home  a lot of times when RBC  programs weren't weren't working super well  the other benefit is that you know you record the video and then it's available afterwards so for people who couldn't tune in live they still had a chance to watch the contents of the meeting  we also sell people just take it out for a weekend so you know they go to brunch on Saturday with the family and then they would go live and then you know people  hi man and there would be this conversation at  the people who did this were like yeah it was awesome like I had a great time  and then we also saw people you know taking it for  you know or run so so a team at Facebook was doing this really race and  you know they wanted to  other folks to kind of cheer them on and give them support so they went live in this is also like a super fun thing for for them and for all the people who participated so some in claim that you know Hey this could actually be something that that other people wanted  and so what we did was we just  we launched it to a small percentage of our users  you know as as kind of a test to see if there were there was interest in the market   and and that was you know the Facebook live product  on android launch on android first and  right away we did see a lot of really really creative uses so one woman you know who's a tattoo artist was started to broadcast live you know I she was in the process of of tattooing somebody  we also us all a woman who broadcasted her her  wedding life because she had family members who couldn't make it and you can travel the long distance  and you know it was a really really cool to be able to see how she could engage and interact with those audience members and almost have a feel like you know there were part of that experience  and you know I've had a lot of fun taking it out  I I managed to get reservations  to one of the best restaurants in San Francisco lazy bear and it's really cool experience because a chef stands up there and he explains every single dish and a kind of talks about you know all  the loving care that went into it you know how this dish came together and I just decide to go live in like a ton of my friends tuned in and everybody like I really wanna go does rest on too so that was really fun   okay so every says to the last question so let's say we built this we validated that it's something that people want  or we think it you know there's enough reason to believe that it that it's  you know something that is a real problem and that's something that is worth solving so now we build it and we put it out there but even actually build for the thing is out in the world  in fact even before maybe we have a full prototype  the question for us to ask is well how will we know if we solve this problem you know like what would the what would be different in the world  what with that you know it's if we fast forward and now this thing that we've done is out there how will we know if we should be happy we should be excited if we think it's you know it didn't live up to expectations what exactly should our expectations be and I think this is a really really important question to ask up front  too often what ends up happening is we have this idea and then we build it and we launch into the world and then the results come in you know we're looking at like the dashboards were looking at how many people are downloading it and what they're saying and you know there's tons of data points that we're trying to you know  interpret and put together but it's hard at that point in time to then be very very objective about did we solved the problem because a lot of you know our natural inclination is to to read  into the good things that people are saying and to kind of consider all of that effort to have been worth it right and that that there's biases that kind of calm from when you know you're already looking at data and you're trying to interpret whether or not it's good or bad it's much better before you launch to have figured out you know what constitutes success for you so that you can you know go into the launch with that understanding and that's results come in you can map it's to your previous you know this was my criteria for whether or not  we solve the problem or whether this was successful  and so what we do here is we want to make sure that we set measurable goals and metrics  and measurable is really key measurable doesn't always mean like numbers or data but it does mean you know  there's a a criteria where if I did this thing and I got this result I know what to make of that results  so for the example of groups I know we  wanted to help people solve the problem of helping them find you know other people  and to talk about their interests with we ended up building a groups discovered dashboard   what the success look like for us so before we launched we determined that well if we were successful at at at actually helping people solve this problem we would see that more people are then discovering you know groups that they're interested in and joining  but not as joining because I know I could make a giant button flash and make it red and I'm sure more people click on it and more people joined like that doesn't really count right what really matters is that they join these groups and these  groups are actually meaningful to them which means that if we you know fast forward a couple months three months let's say and then we look back these people are still using those groups and they're actively engaging meaning there you know talking with other people and their reading that the content there sharing content there liking the commentary you know we want to know that people are joining groups that are actually valuable for them and that there's that they're spending time on so that was actually the more important metric  was  nachos joins but meaningful joins  of for the the the example of you know I wanna be able to quickly express my feelings about a story but not everything is likable you know we launched reactions and prior to launching reactions we wanted to make sure we we  measured a couple things if we were successful here then what we should see is that while people are using these reactions and not just using them you know it's not it's not good enough it like all the people that were previously you know using a sticker  or an emoji or short comment then converted to using reactions because then it's disks for a one for one trade right if reaction was actually more light weight we should see more people using it that then the previous set of people who were using  all of these other tools so that was really important to us  so I was kind of the first thing that we looked at  the second day we looked at was  we want to make sure that every reaction did get a fair amount of usage across different markets and this is important to us because you know  in the beginning even when we started to design reactions we had you know considered lots of different options you know we've considered you know maybe maybe a few funny if you know you were at like  you know you like an awesome button or you know like like there's a couple of tons of different things that we could have put in order to make it more expressive and the reason why we distilled it back down to six is because we wanted to make sure that it was simple to use and if you were going through and choosing from like a grade of twenty suddenly it you know it's doesn't feel that my light weight anymore it feels like you have your pulling up interface and you're choosing something and it's gonna take more than a couple taps to get you to to what you want so it's really important that we  nailed in and got to a really really small sets about that we picked the right set so we want to make sure that these words universal and it wasn't like you know  people in certain countries were using you know certain ones more or people certain demographics were favoring others because it was  a more information things we want to make sure that these were actually  things are expressed  you know the emotion people wanted to to express and all of our different countries and in all demographics  and then finally we want to make sure that the experience was good for the receiver so if you you know posted something and then you got a bunch of reactions did that make you feel bad did that make you feel confused you know was it   you know like did you not know what was it like going on or did you just feel like it was a negative experience that made you want to share less in the future that was also really important and that was actually one of the reasons why we never a straight up you know put a dislike button  because this like in of itself can be very ambiguous and my disliking the content that you posted and my disliking Q. as a person and I just not agreeing with your point of view  and so you know in all of our  our research understand it just like we knew that it was something that people were going to get confused by and wasn't going to be a great experience so when we launch reactions we simply wanted to make sure that that that wasn't the case that the you know a motions that were being expressed felt like they were adding to the posters understanding of of what  what their friends and an audience had to say   and the finally for the example of I wanna spontaneously and authentically share in the moment   what we decided to measure and look at was that you know of course people were broadcasting but again it's not just that they broadcast once because that's something that you can you know make happen by doing a ton of promotion and by putting a front center you know if you just you know if people will try a lot of things once because they don't know what it is what they think it sounds exciting the true test for us was when they had a live you know they went life and they had that experience did they like it enough to go and do it again you know that is the key that tells us we build something that is valuable and that's worthwhile because people come back and do it again and do it again and and you know they'll fill incorporated and make it a part of their lives  the second day we looked at is we want to make sure that well if you know maybe if you find a broadcasters loved it maybe you know everybody wants to go live all the time but is it really  a good produktivnost of watch you know what what people are broadcasting live right and then it sort of one sided and over time broadcasters are not going to want to do that because no one ever watches anything we want to make sure that the contents was actually interesting and a way that we can measure that was is the time spent watching live videos going up for  proportion and and you know when we run surveys and other things are people saying that this is like a valuable thing that they want to watch  so to recap  I whenever is kind of the three questions that we always ask in product reviews and  you know any time we're talking about products  we want to make sure that we we know what people problem we're trying to solve that it's very clearly defined that we can picture you know the audience or a particular person in mind as we're designing the product and that we're not solving you know problems for ourselves our company or our team but that were actually you know focused on  an audience that had a problem that matters for them  second thing is just making sure that we know it's a real problem you know through looking at whatever quantitative data we have through doing focus groups and talking to different users  understanding that this is something that that is a good a good use of time for us to to work on and to solve and finally being a very very rigorous about what does success look like and how will we know if we get a we put something out there and it did what we wanted to do and if not then we go back to the drawing board we learn what didn't work and we keep it a rating but these three questions have help to keep our teams folk  list on  what matters which is ultimately the people that we designed for four thank you guys thank you very much  \",\n",
       " \"my name's in France I'm twenty eight and I am a user experience researcher  on the Google maps team at Google  and I make about a hundred and thirteen thousand dollars a year when I started I was actually a contractor so I was actually making an hourly wage and I contracted for about nine months before my team realized that they actually had need for a full time researcher and they converted me to full time and it became a real live Google employee  when I was  hourly my rate ended up being about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year but of course you have contractor taxes you don't get all the perks you don't get bonuses so when I converted my  salary went down but my overall package actually increased a little bit so that included stock options for a one K. matching  and like I said the the daily bonus so Google  obviously makes a lot of products  it's a huge company and I focused primarily on the maps team maps encompasses you know probably everything you're familiar with Google earth the map of self driving  local businesses  anytime you open up that map it's something that I've touched in some way my main responsibility is to collaborate with project managers and designers  and give them insights about our users that they can enter and put into our products so for example if I go to a designer and say Hey  you know women aren't using Google maps for X. Y. and Z. reasons they say okay we'll figure out how to address X. Y. and Z. in our design and make it more appealing to in this case women or whoever might need to use it specifically the part of Google maps I work on is an app called Google my  business and Google my business is a tool that allows business owners to  claim their business on Google maps which means that you can go to your listing you can change your hours you can respond to reviews and photos and basically control how your  how your business appears on Google I think open mindedness inquisitiveness curiosity and surprisingly like good communication skills I think a lot of people who are drawn to research  kind of introverted nerds like me and you know when I started I thought like all just be able to sit in my lap or my office all day and just churn out cool research and then throw it people and they'll say wow this is great like we're just going to take this and where is interested in the subject is you are and I turned it turned out that was not the case like you actually have to brand yourself and sell yourself and probably thirty percent of my job is just communication and getting Brian from my team and not actually doing the research itself so if you are somebody who can engage really well the people around you and communicate and  build interest in what you have to say then you should probably be a good researcher I think I made a lot of mistakes early on in terms of  not connecting my inquiry enough with the product so for example it's not really enough to say here's a cool finding you have to say here's a cool finding and here's how it applies to your product and here's how it's going to improve your product and really make that connection really strong and I used to put a little too much benefit of the doubt and how much  mental work designers and product managers were willing to do  terms of interpreting my research like you really have to spell it out so I think I'm most of my early mistakes were in being a little too vague about the product application of what I was doing which came a little bit from my academic background where you can just talk about whatever and you don't have to apply it to any kind of hope world scenario but  when you're in industry have to be very very specific about where your research is going and justifying it properly I feel incredibly lucky that I kind of stumbled upon this career path when I was a kid I super randomly wanted to be a car truck tiger for like I found this book about how to draw maps as like that's what I want to do for the rest of my life and I was like that's not really a job anymore because I'm not a pirate so he couldn't really to that and I thought about doing other stuff   but the thing that I kept landing on as for it being this driving leveling no matter what I was at into or  you know I kind of I dabbled in a lot of ideas for what I want to be when I grew up but they all involved  being currently kind of pursuing this independent inquiry and being able to like really dive into something and learn everything I could about it like I wanted to go into forensics and I took a class in blood spatter analysis knows mostly because I was really obsessed with dexter at the time but everything I did involves learning a lot about what I was into  and I didn't really know how to turn that into a   past because like I said like this didn't really exist when I was in high school and through a lot of luck and hard work but a lot of like an   where I get to just  sit by myself and learn everything about maps and I get to like actually get to be the cartographer of the future in a way it's really fun  \",\n",
       " \"for  so to introduce myself  my name is Molly necks I am a senior product designer at uber and I'm here to talk to you today about how we're designs for the future of transportation specifically about the challenges that come with designing for a scale that so massive it's changing the way that city's move it's  providing jobs for people around the world and completely reimagining the concept of logistics  so  quick question to the audience how many of you have ever taken and you perform  yes so another raise of hands but this time different  how many of you have ever driven with the over before  yeah okay but it looks like way less of you dramatically  and up until a year and a half ago when I started to where I was like most of you where I had limited exposure of what the driver experience was like  but a lot of my work at uber has been on the driver partner side and  my jobs my team's job is to create experiences to facilitate this new type of work that the world has never seen before  the focus of what I talk about today is gonna be techniques and approaches for unpacking a complex problem space building true and deep empathy with your users especially in context that you might not be familiar with and being sure that you're solving the right  problems in the first place  now before we get into this I want to take this chance  introduce myself who am I specifically over  and why am I here to talk to you today  so I mentioned before I'm Molly I work on the driver partner experience that you were as well as at the advanced technologies Group  and then in the spirit of saying one non work thing about myself as an ice breaker  I also have applied that background in design to one of my personal interests which is making furniture  and the best way to for me to disconnect because I stare at a screen all day at my job is to go out and make things with my hands  so throughout my talk I'm gonna be doing a little bit of metaphor making to show how really this type of process and approach can be applied to a broad range of projects and contacts so that hopefully all of you regardless of the type of design that you practice can takes a few take away a few lessons learned  so let's get into it  I'm gonna talk about work she guidelines on for what it takes to design at uber and all of us in this room as designers can take forward in the work that we do every day  the important thing to note here is that there's not a one size fits all approach to design process  but this is a rough set of principles and guidelines to help drive your process uber style  so let's start off with the first one starting small and scaling it quickly  uber started in two thousand ten as a simple idea push a button and get a ride  the goal is to make  technology invisible and have a magical experience that transports you from here to there  and over began only six years ago  and that's what it looks like as a service for a hundred friends in San Francisco to get luxury rides and before over acts which is the more economical service that we offer  and launched in two thousand twelve taking an uber men's that you were going somewhere in San Francisco for something more than thirty dollars  but this simple idea introduces the first layer of complexity when designing over over is a two sided market place  riders use over as a platform to get them where they need to go and then drivers use over as a source of income on the flexibility of being your own boss with your own hours on your own terms and from a product perspective this RD means that you have two different experiences to design in this case mobile apps with two very different needs and requirements for both  you seem to almost we know about the writer side so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about the partner out and it seems like a lot of you are less familiar with that  so the rock which is for drivers  enables a driver partner to tell you word that they're ready to drive to get new trip requests to tell them where the writer is to get them to where the writers going and then to do that all over again until they've decided that they were done for the day  and the very first partner up wasn't really  anything crazy or complex  so there is a request  and that's where the writer is  that's kind of about it but with this straightforward system uber started to expands dramatically in  and in this visualization you can see the day a day of trips in New York on two thousand fourteen compared to two thousand fifteen even for years and took over being in New York thirty continues to grow at a dramatically fast pace so as rights increased so did our opportunity to think about how to make a more efficient system as a whole  in this visualization you can see that the by the bright lines that many people are taking the same trip at the same time  so this observation begs the question how might over play a role in reducing congestion in our cities  and then another reserve hands are how many of you have ever taken over pool before  looks like let's see I don't think it's here in Santiago so hopefully   in two thousand fourteen report came on the scene and over Paul makes it easy for people who are going the same place at the same time to share a ride and it's all about getting more people into fewer cars and making cheaper rights for passengers and then also longer trips for drivers and less congestion in our cities  so we're dealing with the growing complexity of the product itself and it dramatically increase scope and  all of the problem but all of this house the need to maintain a simple clear you why inside the apps that we have for both writers and for driver partners  on the drive a partner sites specifically those challenges come with questions like how we design an interface that's clear enough for a driver to get around the city in order to know where to go and pick up riders a drop off writers can currently without ever really looking at the watch  so was expanding our reach in markets that we already operate and but meanwhile Hoover is rapidly expanding around the globe  so today actually Brazil is in uber's top five biggest biggest businesses after the US and India sao Paulo is our big arms aren't suppose number to Mexico City is the biggest and busiest river city in the world  we are in six continents in in seventy two countries  I'm in Silicon Valley at least designers tend to fall prey to designing with the more technology for consumer in mind it designs tend to emphasize the latest trends or the latest interaction paradigms and while users of all kinds exist in the U. us usability issues are magnified in markets like India where a lot of our drivers who drive with uber and are given a smartphone when they first start and this smartphone is the first ever smartphone that they've used  so without global expansion also comes a range of U. acts challenges specifically a growing range of time  nickel proficiency varying literacy rates and with designs it's even more important that clarity take precedence over cleverness and that every afford ins and reduction of tax  goes a long way to making sure that our interfaces are clear and usable to all of our users  so we've seen this global scale change and I'm massive growth  so let's see this all together and all walk you through what it ripple trip is like trying to voice over video so let's go  so you start driving you get any request  dot and now you go to pick up George  Dr arrive George gets in your car and you start his trip  now your driving you get a new request and this is actually another writer who's been match that's taking you about the same way that George was going and so you go pick them up  that slightly change the route that you're going to take  so you go  you pick that writer up they get in your car and you start that trip and then you go to drop your job and then he gets on the car and then you drop that second writer all  and is this process continues so you drop the second minor all now you get a new request another one you drop off a drop off another request an apple continues until you are done for the day  so well that is quite a difference between not one dimensional functionality that we started out with to this extensible trip framework that scales to include many different trips and tasks and actually this only scratches the  because of the complexity that a lot of our partners have to deal with we also do things like food delivery or actually in Santiago pass trips  which definitely adds the complexity that our partners doing while they're using this device in their car  so showing this gradual growth and transition is the first lesson in today's talk about the process of design and product development uber starting small and scaly quickly  and I mentioned before about how I'm going to make furniture metaphors on so I'll tell you how this applies to making furniture as well  you don't have to be a carpenter to build furniture you have to start small and slowly builds our skills over time I am a amateur novice printer maker  so as pictured here my first piece was me going to the beach picking up a piece of wood and sticking up plants into it and I called art and then I went to a ball woods shop where I found a scrap wood been in a really nice piece of walnuts so I send about down put some water oil on it and then it was a cutting board  and then making a dining room table was kind of just like a really big cutting board covered in concrete  and so it's all about the theme with me in building furniture is that I don't have a shot which I see as a design constraints  and my skill set is pretty limited himself talked about no formal training  but I try to just keep Takhli bigger and bigger projects so how can you make sure you're moving bigger and bigger in the right direction  that question brings us to our next section which is designing the right  thing and this is different from designing the thing right I have no idea if that's going to translate well  so a lot of very smart people actually in this room included have come up with very smart remarks to think about design process on one of the ones that we use it over as a technique called double diamonds  and I'll explain that a little bit for those who are not familiar with it but this was developed by the British design council and it can be summarized as two diamonds the first diamond is where you design the right thing which is the section in this talk and this time and is where you the execution stage and this is where you design the thing right or you create the outcome  and the first important point is that there is no one size fits all approach to design process as I mentioned before but it's important for designers to develop a robust problem solving tool kit for problem identification and problem solving  so back to furniture really quickly for a second when you start with a blank space the opportunities are limitless there's a hundred different things you could do and a thousand questions you should be asking  who lives here what is the space use for who will be using the space and the way that I approach furniture and design for myself is not because it's a hobby for me it's really actually always for myself and it's great because it's one of those places that I can truly be selfish with the work that I do  which is definitely not the case when you're designing for context like uber we're very likely the user is very different from your cell  so how do you start to understand who this person is and what they need  one of the strongest attributes and designer can have is the ability to observe have empathy and then translate those insights into designs that solve problems rooted in use by human need  and I'm gonna talk about Sri math is that who were designers and researchers use to gain understanding and empathy which involves getting into the shoes of the cars and even sometimes inviting users into become designers themselves  and the first one is true participation and this is getting into your user shoes as much as possible and  this is me  I am actually going out driving picking up real over passengers and recording my experience for my team so that they can share the insights that I've gained from doing that an outside of talking to our users one of the most powerful tools that we have our disposal is becoming drivers ourselves  so  this is not just me that does that  designers PM's engineers many different roles that you were go out and they all drive and they all pick up passengers so they can truly learn what using the product is life first hand from the driver's perspective and this allows us to truly build empathy with our driver partners and internalize the pain points and seek opportunities to improve the product  personally from driving I have felt like what it feels like  to be waiting outside your writers pick up spot on a busy dark road with four lanes of traffic around you risking getting a ticket and you know in this context that there's truly no way that you can be asked to focus on a phone in a difficult situation like this yesterday we heard Laura martini talk about the importance of high contrast and intentional use of color in the context for designing for healthcare systems  and how she looks to airplane cockpits as a source of inspiration for guiding principles of clear powerful design that same idea definitely applies to designing for driving and it's these principles that we theoretically know to be true when we're sitting at our desks and designing on a screen  but when you're driving in a pop up appears with three small lines of tax and there's absolutely no way that you can read that because you have two eyes on the road that's how we internalize these principles for to optimize for designing for driving and so this is all great but as it turns out you also or not the user so how else can you bring participation into your design process  and that is bringing your users directly into your design process actually we heard were not over do go talk about this this morning where you tube uses a similar approach for on treating your users as stakeholders in the design process and recently to drive our future direction of the recorder experience we invited driver partners into our brainstorming we had them up with designers and tell us what there is  choose were enjoyable moments and then actually participate in their own sketching and idea generation workshop so they can design features for us and by involving driver partners in our process we were able to inject everything from their broader thoughts their issues and product ideas directly into the beginning of the design process and then we have their stories and their insights guiding us throughout the entire process and so all of those early decisions around design direction or shape to directly from them  and so on the other end of the spectrum true observation is going out and being a fly on the wall  in general when you do research it's often recruiting is a difficult and time consuming part of research process   and so an amazing thing about uber  is that it's one of the only services that I can think of where we essentially have something that is push a button and get our participants  all of a sudden a driver partner pulls up and this is really really powerful when you have a quick question or on a concept to validate  and when I ride in cars I actually try not to mention that I work for over not in any nefarious way but rather it's better to get a raw unbiased perspective from the people who were trying to solve problems for without it being under the pretense of Hoover sponsored research where you're subject to get different answers  I'm so finally kind of bringing these two concepts together on one on one interviews with driver partners is also a very common technique that we use  I'm gonna talk about a specific project where we just  recently we were looking at ways to help on people who are new to driving with uber get started and prepared to get on the road  we talked to dozens of new driver partners in both the US and in China to try to learn first hand what questions they have when they were first starting out  and beyond just asking questions  we ended up taking it a step further and actually took their first real uber trip with them with us as passengers so we can observe directly what issues they would actually have on their first real trip  so once we had all this initial data what do we do next  in addition to that foundational research directly with driver partners we  reach out to the operations teams around the world so operations are the eyes and ears in every city that uber operates and they're here in Santiago and they're the ones who work tirelessly to make uber run and operate in every city that number is an  and so we want to see what they were doing to help onboard new driver partners and what they were doing to teach them how the driving experience works we ask them what product opportunities they thought would best serve this problem and I do not our reach we actually ended up getting one resounding feature requests from around the world  and this was to build a practice trip in the partner up and so that what they wanted is a way for a driver partner to kind of get in their car and goes   real over trip except without ever picking a passenger up  and this is a great idea there's no no downside but there's one actual key issue with this idea and when you think about what a practice trip is it would mean that you're actually behind the wheel and you're seeing a brand new out for the first time in that context and going back to our research actually our research showed that  a new driver partner got fairly easily overwhelmed when they were actually behind the wheel and asked to both drive and learn something new at the same time so this is because they're saying it out for the first time it's brand new and then also all of that difficulty I mentioned before about having four lanes of traffic around you  that's not the time to learn something new  so from this our guiding principle for our design process was that when you're actually driving should not be the first time that you're ever exposed to brand new your new you why and a brand new concept that you haven't seen before  so instead we actually read wanted to re focus to a key question which is what is the real problem we're trying to solve with the solution and a big scene that we've heard of this conference and actually Alex so sorry  mention in her talk about chasing problems is that it's important to be problem first and not solution first  and let's sing that in for a second because it's such an and drive a driving force for the work that we do every day problem first not solution first  so  if you look at this practice trip idea it was actually a solution to two different problems  one is that a driver partner did not have a clear understanding of how a trip on uber worked  and then too once they're in the car they're absolutely overwhelmed by brand new you why in a brand new contacts and everything that they theoretically learned when they were out of the car did not  doesn't doesn't retain  so to address that we refocus the problem space into two different parts one is how do we design and experience that prepares a new driver for what a triple entail my teaching them the mechanics of power trip on uber works and then support them as they actually start to drive and they're on there for several trips  it's important to realize that complex problems don't often come with single solutions and understanding the context of the users and or the journey that they've taken to get there is the key to unlocking the service design challenges  so on this is a life overview of that how we impact this problem space and I'll talk about how this project played out a little bit but I wanted to take a second to talk about  how to get the the importance of getting buy in from your team  and so  ultimately on design is just a way of solving problems designers researchers product managers engineers data scientists you name it marketing operations and actually whatever titles that all of you in this room house on everyone should be a part of the design process  better work and better products will be the results so design is really just the process in which you were billed products and if design was simply seen as a stage in the  process maybe coming in later it would inherit all of the decisions made prior to the design starting which we refer to in the industry as putting lipstick on a pig  so the best thing that you can do to get this by and  empathy from your teammates is actually have them along for the ride and in this case quite literally  when a researcher and I brought one of our engineers and our team into the car with us so that he could see what the experience was like first hand that he was building on what you actually can't see in this picture is he also has his laptop with him and he's actively for Kate fixing bugs as he sees them while the cars driving also just we like to think of   so at burger we are lucky to work alongside engineers that care enough about the just product that they're building to want to come along to do that so it means that they care enough to want to learn what the research process is like and so even when doing things like small scale usability studies having our roles like engineers or product managers directly observe and maybe asking them to be the note takers of the session ensures that we're building empathy across the organization  so okay next action so now that you have a solid understanding of the problem space you've talked your users give a clear  articulation of the problem that you're going to solve your whole team is bought into this process now is the time to actually start the part of the design process that most people consider design  so how do you start   that so how do you start that with furniture  the first lesson is to find any way that you can to produce tiger solution and you want to try to learn as much as possible without investing resources turn it into building something that might not work so take a piece of wood put it on a chair out of cardboard box you want to feel the space and start to understand  sort of a deeper level of understanding of what the outcome should look like  only then do you go out and you find the right materials you make decisions around styling and then you build that you put into place and you would just  so that's the  beautifully over simplified version I try to follow and making furniture but going back to the actual over part of the process in number inevitably by now you have some sort of idea of what you want to build and so this is where you start to explore a broad range of possibilities and design directions and the best way to do this is actually quite simple it's just start somewhere and make something  so some designers prefer to start on a notebook sketching on paper others hop right into their favorite program and make wire frames and you're really crazy you dive into high fidelity prototyping and there's no right answer with this stuff but the only guideline is out the bra   the scope of the problems the last fidelity you should probably start with so from an early concept for example starting with the high fidelity solution might get you feedback on things like visual treatment but when you're really looking to get feedback on the broader concept it's best to kind of take a step back and use more of a wire frame pathology  so relating to fidelity let's bring it back to that project about helping new drivers start out with the uber  so in this second part which is about supporting drivers through their first real trip we want to figure out what information is important to help new drivers when they're actually doing a trip for the first time  and from all that base knowledge about designing for driving we knew that we had to reduce the amount of complexity on the screen and then keep elements that are important like the map which is telling the driver where to go  but the idea and bear with me for a second is that we want to create turn by turn navigation except for you why so kind of like how a voice speaks out and tells you to turn right at the end of the road  but for buttons on the screen so also in principle kind of similar to the types of coach marks that you might see on the screen when you first open up an out for the first time it tells you how a button works or how to move forward in a flow  in this case you're learning something well you have two hands on the wheel and two eyes on the road and it's important to maintain that and you're also in a context where you're already listening to your phone telling you what turns to make  so that was the idea it was art instruction like slide  green bar to start the trip at the screen in which that step appears this reminds them how to use this brand new you why and what to do at each step in the flow  so the question becomes how do we build something that we can learn from quickly  from our valuation research sessions we knew we wanted everything to work exactly as a normal trip would accept with this extra added component  voice  so we got a little bit creative advertising methods  we use the actual partner up I sat in the backseat of a car with a laptop and I read out the instructions that we thought would be good at each step in the trip flown  this is great because it required no real design work it was literally just in Prague  so we have the standard list of instructions that we identified based our initial foundational research but this format  give us the flexibility if there was a specific moment that a participant was having trouble with I could improvise and just added a new line of instruction text and then try to evaluate its performance without specific driver partner  then we can use that instruction for all of the  kind of following participants that we had in our research studies  so what did we learn from all this the faster that you get your ideas in contact with the real world the faster you can find out what is wrong with them and then improve them so low fidelity prototyping even as easy as that wizard of oz technique that I just showed you is the easiest way to get this quick feedback that you're looking for without investing a lot of upfront resources  it's also important to note that sort of prototyping how  as in many different shapes and sizes it's common for designers to think that a prototype means something that you quoted up in framer or you put together in principle but really  you want something that gets the information that you're needing at the fidelity of question that you want to answer so dear it's all about kind of asking what information are you actually looking for with that prototype that you're building  and now I'm going to switch gears a little bit and talk about a different project where we learn key insights later in the process when we're out more of a high fidelity stage  so  one and half years ago the driver design team set out to tackle a ground up redesign of the partner out  so far in this talk I've been talking about the part of the partner experience what happens when you're in the car we we call on track but this project focuses specifically on everything that happens when a driver partners out of the car or not on trips so the goals of this project were to take the opt for us something with limited functionality which was essentially going online taking steps and inviting friends took over on to becoming the one stop shop for managing your business and this included a whole new addition and set of functionality such as checking your earnings or on monitoring your feedback from your writers  so we want to make sure we were designing  information architecture that reflects most what's most important to partners and not the organization that we design within so through research we identified the four key buckets the first one is   knowing when and where to drive and getting timely information and this is the home town then tracking your earnings and finding out about opportunities to earn more and this is the earnings Tom then getting feedback from your writers and learning how you can improve this is the ratings time and then finally managing all of your information and this is in the account tab  so our process for arriving on overall ABS and structure after the initial problem framing and foundational research was complete was to start with wireframes exploring a vast number of possible design directions and then we conducted weekly interviews ability so these this one looks like it was conducted in a prison but over the course of a month where we would put the latest designs of the prototype whether it be a piece of paper with a screen shot on it or cool tap through on interactive prototype  I think we put each prototype in front of driver partners to get their feedback and we learned a lot and change all lots during this process but one of our blind spots in this process was that we end up limiting our research pretty much to driver partners in California  so as I mentioned before uber is this massive global products and this is a direct violation of the guideline that I gave earlier in the presentation which was designed global first so we learned a lot from this miss half but when we finally ended up taking a prototype to India fairly late in the process the moment we put it in front of users we learn interesting insights related to the visual details that drastically change the initial understanding of the U. Y. itself so I'll give you  a little bit of background about  as mentioned before driver partners in India have never a lots of driver partners in India have never used a smart phone before the one that they use to drive with uber  in addition to this driver partners in India have varying literacy rates or are able to read in their local language but maybe not in English which is actually the default that most of the phones that they use are set to  so often driver partners in India rely much more heavily on iconography in order to memorize where features are are located within the out and so this poster is actually something that's posted in the  onboarding center in on the boat India and what you can see here is that that is an English it has kind of call outs in Hindi and then labels in good dropping it which is the local language and  that state so you can see that they're also kind of struggling with this   way so it kind of a communique what we need to to have partners with varying literacy rates  so on top of all of this issue of language and understanding drivers in India also deal with frequent network connectivity issues which is a really challenging if your job is to drive around and get requests on your phone that fundamentally depends on having a network connection so  we have earnings sorry we had a home earnings ratings accounts and we not the iconography already use this was helpful because  driver partners in India also often  visual and  lion visuals to use so   show this designed to driver partners India and then almost unanimously driver saw  the second tab from the left was where they would go to manage their network settings and that seemed really random toss Americans who usually we only use it you lose network connectivity if for off hiking or in a tunnel so why did they think this is for network settings there's two real reasons one is because network connectivity is top of mind for drivers in that region and also the icon that we selected looks like but network settings bar so also the second reason is that things like bar charts don't communicate well turned to drivers in the market it's not a relatable way to communicate that earnings information because bar charts you require kind of a non math education to understand  so we change the icon to be a more clear literal interpretation of money rather than an abstract representation of a bar chart  and in this case where you really seemingly small detail like an icon selection when combined in the context of a low network connectivity environments and having really drastic impact on the clarity of are you why and it's in moments like this where designing the thing right becomes increasingly important  so  this is the part of a talk also where we start to talk about the other part that people think is most of the design process which is making things move making things pretty or my favorite description making things pop  and this is on a very important part of the design process as this is what sets are products of part is your brain  and it's the feeling people how when they're using your product and how does over talk about that  so  were lives by this traditional mantra useful usable desirable and we end up talking on one extra element which is made with love so this is where delights  don Norman how to Ted talk in two thousand three where he talked about sort of the three components of a motion that concert to light the first one is visceral and this is the initial impact of the experience the second one is behavioral and this is what the total experience and performance and then the third one is reflective and that's how the product makes you feel  and what I love most about this framework is that it adds a weights and a dimension to part of design that  we as designers kind of know and feel but ultimately it's hard to quantify in a lot of times the people that we work with every day that a little bit more may be skeptical about the value of delights in design  it it adds weight to that I'm kind of concerned so what are some of the ways that  were things about to light  our branding and our videos like this are examples of how we achieve visceral delight in the work that we do for product design and through branding it's beautiful it's emotional it's elevated it wow is you with its movement and its dynamics and elevates the feeling of the product itself  so another progressive has actually  how many you have ever experienced over ice cream  cool okay less severe so I wasn't sure if that would  the thing that people knew  over ice cream is an example of behavioral delights  and this actually this videos from right here in Santiago which is kind of why I asked many of you have actually seen it before  and for those not familiar this is  one day a year when Hooper turns into push a button and get ice cream delivered around the globe and so beyond the visceral packaging design and the Q. decals on the cars fundamentally what scenario could be more delightful than pushing a button and having ice cream delivered to your doorstep  so that said actually judging by all the jackets in this video I think we can make it a little bit more delightful if we change the season that it runs  so  then we can move on to reflected the light and this is how the entire product makes you feel and we like to make think of the entire experience as an example of this so reflective is a type of delight where you know your life is better because you have the flexibility to earn income that works within your schedule  or the type of delight that  you can feel that knowing where ever you go you have a safe reliable ride home and it extends far beyond what we typically think of when we think of delight but it's perhaps the most important value that we as designers and as product creators can deliver  so now back to our process I promise this last section shorter  once you have your project ships it's solving problems it's delighting users around the globe and millions of people are using it every day  you're all done right  can go home job job completes no  you have to do it all over again so in any in house design team you also have to be comfortable  doing it all over again even as soon as your design is out the door so the way that you learn is never been afraid to go back to design the right thing stage which is where you take what you just launched and then question all of the initial assumptions that you made at the beginning of that process because likely the world has changed in the time it took you to build that thing in the first place  so in the world we operate in the design you make today will likely not be here in a year from now and almost certainly will not be here five years from now so despite launching a brand new partner up last year we already are thinking about ways to tear it all down and prove it once again given all the insights that we've gained in the last year and the beauty of working in a context where you have full control over the design outcome is that you can go back and reassess and re evaluate all the decisions that you made prior and this is actually one of my favorite things about working on an in house design team purses an agency because it allows you to help full control of the product after you've delivered at  so one more example of furniture in this case ceramics on their projects which you will not always get right the first time so the one on the left is the first cop that I ever made I did not mean for it to look that way the colors are wrong the shape is lopsided but you know you do it over again the next one's closer still some issues and then finally about third attempt probably gets a little bit closer to what you're going for and   so all these cups are serving their needs their holding coffee real smoothly we wanted to look at sort of the entire entire Cup journey of all aspects of delights  so  wrap this up on went over things of terms like service design  the best service transcends the whole journey which is digital to physical and not just that destination uber has this exciting mission to transform transportation and in ways that are uniquely beneficial to individual cities and we look to all aspects of the uber experience for opportunities to iterate and improve upon our experience as a whole so the uber experience does consider this whole which is human to human  she went to a computer  and human so city  so kinda to summarize  design is this process of framing work that allows you to come to into different situations and make it successful each time  I hope the several examples I've given have illustrated  sort of how the beauty of design is out there is one no right answer and knowing which methodologies and techniques to use as often and design project in itself  so starting small establishing true and deep empathy with your users identifying problems tirelessly searching for a solution all of this behind the scenes stuff comes together so that you can deliver a simple human experience for your customer and allow us to speak I hope people spend their time in more meaningful ways  and  thank you  morning thank you very much more  \",\n",
       " \"what about side in a talking with you to that slack  he's also the author of  music you know  thank you for having me absolutely I think you're awesome  also you know  what would be your top two suggestions for  so the first thing I would say is that  boxer user interface so bought me to service a good product Sir service  ran so boats are only as good as the service that that's what  the second thing is to think about on the season final work with C. and then work the least amount of steps that can actually keep most people want to have to get stuff done right so if you really off load that has the least about steps you you make it more effective like you have the secret of receipts web or mobile like in the third one is to use common sense and I can show you the exact right on so you'll be the user okay and I'll be the box you west so  okay hi I'm great thought before I tell you what I do  I want you username and password or based  Johnson with  so you see that this conversation was a bit awkward cumbersome  in the keys there if we turn our fault composition actual conversation we can see what works and what we've been doing conversation for a long time but actually finding products we've been doing  we can use the way we do conversation people to optimize and the like users so using rigid direction building the the final and then using common sense and creating a conversation with people I think these are the key   also  question is this I think is really  mountains  yeah if you had one to just trust in a bar all will be  otterbox  first of all is being very transparent about what is the what is the use  all four and what are you doing  all in the second thing is making sure that the user know that this is a box so sometimes people change between you  and bought some day intertwine these soon being very transparent about what you do what is the service and what you do information   awesome thank you so much for thank you for having me also  you get the book  citing but rarely  let's  \",\n",
       " \"I was losing my name's Bobby commercial and shared around we're gonna sit now with twenty five masters of the design industry we're gonna learn from them every single week we're gonna learn how the best companies in the world approach communicate and a poor design in their businesses everyday in this episode we're seeing now with video hill works DA is the director of design and were you focus on having a transparency defining design principles to that team and using narratives to get buy in from stakeholders will get to this episode right after this quick message from our partners to stick around  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  thanks for joining us thank you for having me go right so first question  what's one thing about design that's clear to you that you don't think it's quite others  so I spend quite a bit of time thinking about this and  to me design is about team work and I don't always think that that's obvious to everyone  as a designer you start out your career usually honing your craft  but I think you know no design can be done alone you're always in a team and if I look back at my own career  the   is  no product no design I could have produced or  shipped without help of others beat designers others around you so  it's something that I want to instill in other designers and when I look at portfolios or interview someone is trying to get to  the core of that like how do they work with others   how did they get to  results because I don't think any great  product  exists in isolation  do you do you believe the designers can actually own an idea or do you think that it belongs to more than one person  so it's a good question I think to some degree ID's are cheap by Iran invent that quote  yeah  in my in my days I DO  that was it was something that was repeated over and over again so you get a lot of ideas out  I think there is a part ownership  but  I think it's more about taking something good  and making it better so continuously building iterating and that's where you get over time a sense of ownership that you can she be it contributed to a great design  and sometimes   does contributions are obvious and and and and you feel good about them sometimes they're the smallest detail but  to me that's the definition of ownership in in design  well  you are probably the only designer I know who has a graduate degree in economics    it is  probably true  AT your banker is that we're saying here actually I was used to reshuffle portfolios back in nineteen ninety nine it's awesome it's no joke  that lasted for about three months however   yeah I know it's it's it's a path that chosen when I was seventeen  eighteen  since I filled  a pilot school  I'm actually happy I didn't become a pilot to be a terrible pilot  but yeah that's correct  are there any like core principles that you learned in that period of time that has somehow help shape the way you approach designed for specifically how design actually plays a role in the business  I think that  any background where that's economics or other  and even beyond education shapes who you are as a designer  I think there are certainly things that  influenced me as a designer with my background   let's be interesting to think of it in terms of more macroeconomic   theories  like demand and supply   I think what's interesting about that is  you know if you put good design forward  people are going to want that and I think over the last decade you've seen that where that's apple in the hardware space or  even with software to quality of the experiences we we enjoy today  to me there there is there is some connection to that and obviously   you know back I think in my days   in college someone said if it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense so  just there's a business reality all of those things yeah   I I don't know who the court is it true we did too but  it always stuck with me  and then more recently I've come to think of price   itself number as  actually a product experience its price makes you feel a certain way low price match may make you feel good because you're getting a bargain may make you feel bad because you tried to sell your house  and obviously being it over  price and how we deal with price in the experience of pricing   I've come to think of that as user experience not just a number it's actually much deeper than that and how you communicate and designed around that is over   we as an industry talk about minimum viable product a lot is there such a thing as an economically viable design  I believe a design should never hurts  a revenue stream for example right because that's just bad design  so I think they're linked they're they're they're linked in the sense that  if you can't complete a certain task yeah that's going to hurt the business  and I think is that realization that makes designed so important   and and to me that's the the things I look for is this design supporting  the best case for the business  and at a bare minimum is it not you know introducing   friction or  something that you can complete those  at the end of the day people are buying something  they're not just spending money  randomly  so you have to be able to deliver that and the best way possible and that's where design comes in  so we we talk a lot about effective communication and design  so my first question is do you think our industry does a good job communicating what we do to to people that aren't designers  and the second part to that question is how do you communicate are designed to non designers of the other people around you  transfers part I think it varies  I think we've seen great improvements in how we communicate the value of the design  in the last decade or so  I think there'd be many   companies and people who have done a great job ads  not only telling the stories but actually delivering great experiences  and you know you can go for the usual suspects  apple but also  companies like Facebook and and and Google has really stepped up their their design game as well  so I think we're getting better and better ads  establishing design as a as a as a requirement  and communication is a big part of that  and you know one of the things I I I learned back in college in economics or at a bank or things like that is  selling and their design always has a part selling because what we create isn't real until it is real so therefore you need to convince others that this  is the best that this is the way forward internal selling say so it's it's with the stake holders and getting them to essentially believe in the thing that I think it starts there because   you have to make it real it has to become a reality and once it becomes a reality you can talk about it you can communicate it outwardly yeah but it starts internally  because otherwise it has no no  booting in in in reality in something that you can achieve or talk about  so what so what do you focus on your your selling design internally or talking to people that might not understand what it is designers to write what is like what are you are you walking in with something they can look at in touch for you walking in and kind of vocalizing an idea getting them in from a white board to draw some stuff like how do you how do you engage them what is the selling process look like  I think I'd be lucky to work out a lot of companies that   got the value of design so I don't I need to do less selling of the function person per se however  you always need to communicate  can't keep it in this like magic box and and keep it there and when they say this is it we're going forward so  I think there's communicating  excitement about something and that might be higher fidelity but there's also communicating how things work  what it takes to get there  and does a whole different thing so it's it's a communications we spectrum  I mean as designers we once the you know the maze  ng animations the amazing graphics something that looks   you know appealing  and that's good that helps but not when you're talking to  front end engineers are back and engineers you once  to make sure that you communicate well where is this call coming from at which point is this transition  seer tailoring it to the audience absolutely you're still had different thing every time absolutely  you have to be able to to walk those   lines between because if you you know if you put a an amazingly detailed design  you gonna get amazingly detailed feedback and that's not always what you want so tailing the  the message to the audience is something that I mean most folks would agree is is a good thing and we have to do it because if we if you do it at the end and I've made mistakes myself  and and afterwards you tell yourself yeah well that's what I would be done to learn from the process yeah so they're they're probably I mean thousands of people watching this right now that   a probably don't understand that selling is a is a  a component of the function of design and these are designers right  we really want them to try to think about walking into their next meeting and not just presenting where you're presenting like an excel spreadsheet right now you want to really pitch you want to get people excited about this thing what are some steps they can take  to a think about the audience to make sure that their tailoring the message  what is the medium of presentation that they should be thinking about  and then are there things that they should be saying she  they be focusing on the process should they be talking kinda long term  here's what we're gonna do in the next six months or Hey here's how we start next week and you're going to be a part of it like one of the things that they should be thinking about their  one of the things that I've come to realize is that as designers essentially we're storytellers you whenever you enter meeting you're telling a story sometimes we short story sometimes a longer story  but the story builds up has different  ways of  going  fruits narrative and I think that's where the key is you start out with thinking about it as a story so as an introduction as a plot and now I'm getting a little you know the detail about it don't go write a novel or something but   I think you have to take people along the journey  and  and even though that sounds kind of you know silly   it's rooted in reality  because most folks that look at a design a fresh to it they don't they don't sometimes they don't even have contacts so and it even if it's a small thing  so I think the minute you think of it as a story you start to be more mindful about how you're going to tell that story because you can just go in because it's all the all the alternative is from up a few screens and you're rambling on one screen for ten minutes and it's only like a weight I need to move on to the next thing and then you know we've all we've probably all being in those design reviews that that turned into a bit of a a chaos and  and then everyone's chiming in and  you covered two percent of what you actually want to cover   so I think that's important now  I think everyone does it a little differently and I I don't have a set process how you communicate so some L.  there's different  times use different techniques but  clarity is important and hitting some some some points that you you want to hit and  also leaving a design review with   some amount of of you know assurance like okay this is what we're gonna do next or this is how we  gonna it's going to involve this war worst case scenario  the story was terrible and  you start over and that happens to and that's okay  so I think it starts with that and I myself I'm still trying to become a better storyteller it's hard as are the yeah like are you doing anything to become a better story told teller what are you focusing on for yourself I read a lot of fiction nice that I mean it  it's amazing the the world she can create out of letters and words that arrange themselves  and  I remember during my time at Flipboard we had   really yeah professional folks dad had decades of experience in the magazine industry  and how they think about creating an article for instance and  the story arcs in lines and that's what opened my eyes to being able  to tell good stories  but yeah that's something that I'm still working on his writing scares the Bee Gees are  for decades design has impacted how we  live  now it's beginning to shape how we work  here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  we're inspired by our design program which is over sixty years old  today IBM employs more than one thousand three hundred professional designers and we've certified more than sixty thousand IBM verse in the practices of IBM design thinking  the result  divers teams working more closely than ever with our clients their users and our partners to create modern solutions   provide differentiated human centered outcomes to the world we'd love to share the story more closely with you  and I hope to see you soon at one of our IBM studios worldwide  we'd also like to thank our friends and envision for their support invision is the world's leading product design platform powering the future of digital design through their deep understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One every Indy and that looks let me tell you three reasons why I use it one poor communication is one of the biggest blockers for talented team to we don't get feedback from others early and often you can get lost in the woods and that's just bad for everyone and three without a prototype it can be hard to show others your full vision for design invision solve all of that you can rapidly prototype at the front end of the design process  and collaborate across every stage of the project it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers and developers and writers teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when they use envision sweet a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision apt Akan and use our access code I. N. B. E. dash high resolution for three months free  so you've now been over for over a year and since then there's a lot of great projects of ships but what we're really cares about is what your first three months look like  and especially what your prioritized coming into a pre existing design team   so  you know taking over  a design team is never an easy things of the first things you do is not necessarily diving into the pixels  I took the time to  assess both the team composition  also  reached out to  product managers and engineering to see  even though the project has just started what are some of the things that were working weren't working  so they have a three sixty view of it once that was done you really want to dive in and  the main challenge at over verses a re small start up is that  you're really proposing changes that affect hundreds if not close to a thousand people that work on this product  so  that told  see that as a design team and design organization we need to have our act together because if we don't that chaos breeds more chaos and  that's the last thing you want   the other thing was to really focus the design team  and find and if the high impact projects like this you want a team that really works well together where  there's no concerns about egos or who owns what  and that takes time  coming in as someone new leading the team  you need to build trust   with with the entire team  so was re too full to free the the first three months was a setting up a process for the design team  to be successful and to let them  run in an organized manner to was also  making sure all the stakeholders  and that is mostly product and engineering  understood what we were trying to do  yeah weekly updates all those things you need to set up a minimum amount of process not too much because then it feels bureaucratic which is also not great but you need to create space for designers to do what they do best which is create amazing work  and  so that was really the food first three months is is getting it's like yeah  starting the engine making sure keeps running sometimes stalls to okay should we started but keep keep the engine running  and make sure your you know  people mentioned it before but at some point you just become the **** umbrella for everyone  there's no no  more PC way of saying it that is really a big part of my job is to ensure that the team can do what they want and get them excited about the problem head  cell and then additionally to that is is also talked about product talked about engineering but also  her we loop in research contents make them part of the process to really figure out where where we're going  and a lot of uncertainty you need to be comfortable with uncertainty those first months are going to be now uncertain you're not going to know where it goes yes you have an inkling you take a few bets but  it's it's messy design is messy people forget that it's never cleaned that result should be clean yeah but how you get there is I think every designer you'll talk to is going to have a different experience of how they got to where they got  in in a product you talk a weekly updates much a very curious just tactically like what what is a weekly update update look like  who does it go out to is a design focused and then what do you focus on  in that update  so doesn't go out it's in person I don't like sending docks and things like that they're great for documentation at some point every week  we would sit together either over over a video conference call whatever you know with the lead so engineering product design gotcha whatever needs to be there minimum amount of people preferably  so it was a group of five people maybe and   we talked for it and the first three months is really designed talking because the engineer looking at you like what you got Yasser what you got what are we doing now   and that was great that cadence was great but   but I I I don't like sitting out like emails I mean they're important they can be important for our organization but   for design like you need to do that in person you need to  you know unit also need to build trust   documents and and sly stone is a bill that same amount of trust I believe so  Travis is currently the CEO who were obviously and her yeah  yes  talk to us a little bit about your relationship with him and his team  and how are they  empowering designed specifically digital product design at over    Travis was great to work with  she really  gave enough room for the product design team to  explore to come up with a design  that speaks to what uber is about  and  and the mission we have  and how it fits within the broader   you know well that who wants to create an  he he's really excited about those things which is refreshing to see  he's not prescriptive but he will push  so for instance   you know he he wants the map to come alive inside were product that's cool  of course we're like  does that mean we're gonna build sim city right  preferably yes but that's not going to happen but it it tells us that we can push the envelope from a creative perspective from a design perspective to start bringing some things alive that once you open the uber app and you're trying to get a ride that you feel like you're in your city or see that you're visiting and that it feels alive  N. and that sets the tone for everything allows you to do  things and  so again not prescriptive necessarily it's not specific solution it's it's  it's these nuggets that really get people excited that I think  a CEO can do those things that's amazing right you can walk you can say I want the map to be a life and just walk out  and I think designers get excited about that  yeah  and so when I was three years ago really good about that and  and he's also supportive of those things and will make it happen you know call themselves the chief problem solver which I think is kind of cool it's like you know  so you see something says something and let's people own the solution to it and  as designers we don't have a responsibility to hit that to do that and that's exciting that's exactly so speaking about the trust an apartment that Travis established in the design team  after your first three months or during that period of time your first  project was the recent uber app redesign that's right  okay so I mean the first thought that was  a fully executed yes  thank you especially considering the scale of of over and I think something that's really  interesting to many designers is how does a company at the scale and size of uber actually ship a product with that level of craftsmanship especially the first release   so to be fair I guess it wasn't necessary first release since we've done a couple of releases but the first release in a while of of what we call the rider experience   but I think it goes back to what I said earlier you set the stage in those first three months  you know you have executive support  to to do this  so then it's really up to the design team and design leadership in general  to create an environment where you can get to that level of craftsmanship   but more importantly  no it's not the designs that ultimately write the code yeah I mean some try I try it's terrible but and that's good and we we should all prototype and we did a lot of that we had a design engineer on the team who was able to quickly test imported type things in real time we're real code  using were a P. eyes so that we could go out and see how it would  yep resonate with users or how is certain animation would feel  but it also means working closely with the engineering team  because they are the ones who build it and they  get as excited as designers get about these types of things actually I would argue that some engineers are great designers  and I've I've been lucky to work with  quite a few frat my career and hear it over to there are quite a few that are amazing ads understanding it and we'll take it to the next level like you know and that they'll they'll do the work for a few hours and then they're like Hey check this out and a look at it like man you made it like ten times better this amazing  and it's that's thrust where you're just working together back in for if that is  that is critical  and it's not always easy because I think many designs were what  would not disagree that sometimes things get left on the table that animation you really want it out didn't have time for it I'm sorry  but I think it comes back to building excitement and trusts because even during  the redesign effort and the final stages I recall that we were reviewing a final animation little dot that comes in and then grows and shows a short cut on the screen  and  I really want that in there for a gazillion reasons but what was amazing is that  it got hot fixed into the apt two days before it shipped and I did not have to argue for it a platform engineer  did the job for me and that was an amazing moment because you certainly have  an entire team and organise  nation that supports these types of decisions  and I think as designers like building those bridges is important  because the next time something doesn't make it into the product so you should ask yourself well why was that here was there you know did I not full of  entirely was a truly a trade off isn't going to get into the next release like what how how how do we do those things because sometimes you know after the first disappointment we sort of give up like okay never made it yet  I would like to ask the question okay when's the next release once the next release how long is it going to take what does it take  and keep pushing that  and I encourage also it over sit down with your engineers because they'll love it trust the love it so it sounded like there was a great deal of buy in from engineering which is really important and you spoke about the bridges that designer scenes of former these different on these different works to be able to ship this level product but what did that actually look like was designed sitting next engineering while they work on this project like yeah how did they establish that that report was sitting very close   yeah you have to  proximity is everything sometimes you need to go away and focus not alone but as designers as a team there is times when you need to not be distracted  minute mainly because you're just trying to figure out your story you don't have a story yet you don't have anything to show yet and it's terrible so there's times when you need to focus  and there's times when you need to be available where  you sit down with engineers and obviously that's hard to scale  the ratio from designs to engineers is  might be one to five might be one to ten who knows so the other thing we did is we start building an internal website where we just started sharing all of the design hold the motion prototypes and that's slowly started turning into a bit of a platform ask  resource for folks but you need to support everything you're trying to achieve because it's not enough to just say well I have this great motion study here and this is how I know people need to know engineers need to know they'll ask you  what's the what's the timing on this what's my busy curve if you want to get really technical right like   because that point one second might make the difference between having a feel supernatural and something that is terrible  so you know we need to as designs need to think beyond just   delivering the design itself especially when it matters at scale because there's no way going to sit down with a thousand engineers  everyday I wanna I wanna get into I would go back to the hot fix  because like that to me is a rare thing it's not that engineers don't care that designers don't know necessarily how to work with engineers to make them care I just think it's it's rare to find a level of collaboration around Polish  where to me that that probably speaks a little bit more to the values of of uber and its products instabilities right so the engineer probably found it inconceivable to launch something that everyone didn't whole heartedly believe in   what do you think  drove that hot fix at the end of the day  yeah  I think it goes back to what we're talking about earlier  a bit of communication and also  education in the sense that I think  you know we sometimes only see what we want to see and I feel the role of design is also to open people's eyes to how mazing it can be and I think throughout the process because it happened so early in the process now  I think we were able to build that excitement created excitement where it became natural to have that and it was foreign to not happy so you switch it around whereas usually there's a you live in a world where now we don't need that  used people start to think like something missing something not quite right here  and that's where you want to get to it but it takes time it takes  it it certainly takes time I mean I remember like when the engineer started  day they need to get their machine running to now like four weeks the apt look like nothing frankly quarters they they rewrote the entire app from scratch  so literally the you know their first prototype was a box sure it's like okay  yeah but you know it and I think they they went through that those phases to but it's really you know where we usually tend to think about something that doesn't need to be there at this house more felt like something was missing and  and I feel that that's where   design  did a good job it can that since its out I mean it sounds like the whole weekly update thing that you're talking about getting the engineering and the product leads in a room  created this the the schedules of reinforcement to show them a what good design looks like  and be while you guys were building out or they were the engineers rewriting the out from scratch as they were kind of just putting layers of skin yeah on the app  it sounds like that engineers specifically probably saw what the design team had envisioned and saw the delta between that and what was going to ship and there was a moment of pride that came to play that said engineers and engineering is not going to be the blocker of making this call right and and so like big that taking that personal responsibility it sounds like I think that also goes back to what we're talking about earlier that sense of ownership plus were instantly becomes a much broader thing than just a designer fighting for what's right it's like now actually everyone is fighting for what's right that's awesome dream that is the dream doesn't always successfully work that way but as long as you can you know hit those points   it I think it matters and  doing the right thing it does matter  I have a question rentals  to find you guys built an internal website to share stuff why is that white why internal one not just like a  like an invasion or something maybe we like to build things are self  say that I think anyone would recognize that it is like of maker culture there there are yes there are like ten tools no we'll just make out  it started I frankly it started  Google slides no nothing got to two hundred slide no kidding and I remember telling the product lead I'm like you know it's gonna break right like and think this is not scalable at all   but it worked for awhile and it was great like if you're trying to establish like big pieces and and  and you're trying to communicate and and to be honest it was lies is great common features or yelp you name it where you use that or or  Dropbox paper it doesn't matter right is there some some great features there but at some point it was really just it was a way for us to communicate at scale right  and   and I think it pay dividends because when you re do something as fundamental as  our our writer experience  you don't just do it like once and you're done you need to be able let's say someone walks in the door tomorrow at over and says okay how do I design for the rider experience  we need to start somewhere you need to understand the decisions we made the components you can use so that website starts to form a kernel of of more of a platform type or design system    website and  and websites just one way of communicating that there's many ways but you know it seems like that's the is most easily accessible and  and most easy to distribute so it's it really started out as we need to communicate with more engineers and we can sit down with in person  and that actually turn into   more of a way to   exposed to system that  we were working on  because it's an and we did both at the same time which somehow I always end up in that situation  but it helped because everything you do for a platform perspective is ill influenced by real by real product  because the dangers always that you create a platform that looks perfect me like can't use any of this in the real world so   and and I I always you know  struggle with that balance but I think  it is doable but so many things throughout the process   sometimes happen by happy accidents  and  you take that you like actually that's reasonable way of of of being able to do things so what are other tools are resources that have been put in place to help build that excitement transparency outside of design   I think prototyping is key I mean more and more we you see that throughout the industry right and  I would even say that  there is prototyping on on a level that makes a quick you know you name it you can use  invision principal one and framework  but also having folks that know how to balance  design engineering talked about earlier those people that can actually get production code into the application as well but our designers that Hart  I think that's in a role that's involving  but  we  he wouldn't be able to make ask  progress as quickly as we were if it weren't for  a resource like that it's just impossible  because that you know as much as framer allows you or any of the other tools allows you to express it in code  it's not like you get this ship Java script inside and native application at least not here so  being able to even get closer to the metal so to speak  is good but that that takes expertise I would recommend you know unless you're really into it a desire to dive into swift and be the best with engineer ever   but it becomes important to to do that because  nothing is static anymore these days certainly not an application it's impossible to to think of it that way  having changes actual question kind of a personal question for you   it looks like numbers were talking earlier before we started recording this it sounded like a lot of your experience just generally as a designer in life has been through a series of apprenticeship it's right  what and and that  I mean I would assume you'd probably gave you a lot of mentors in your and your design career what are the things that you were taught  when you were a younger designer just breaking into the industry  what are some of the things that you were taught that you would impart to other people that are just writing into the industry   so what was interesting so I started out working for audio  and I remember  when I started I always wanted to be right  because I was so afraid  failure or for not being right  so that's how  I behaved initially it's like they know is right I know it's right  and it was terrible attitude actually I got called out immediately first three months like  yeah well you do good work but here  you know you should you should open up you should take feedback each day critique of terrible taking critique as well as like any negative feedback or would like by your head off probably two of  so  I started to be more patient be more open to it and and be okay with making mistakes or not knowing something because if you don't know something will you start learning more about it so end and I think you know  that's something that  always happens in life you know you you you don't want to fail you don't you want to do a good job and sometimes that makes you over protective so   yeah that's something I try to impart now with designs as well like  but you need to create an environment where that's okay and and you can do that   because sometimes it's it's just hard to to  be vulnerable and try a few things but as designs we need to because otherwise we're not going to get to the the right results so that's that's a big one to me that was one of the first things I I need to learn because obviously with back on economics and working in a bank the bank it was right old time I'd like you to best trader ever and amazing in numbers don't lie  yeah so well there's that too with it it's it's a very true  so you know it's  designers need to be comfortable with that the uncertainty and  and as you as you gain more experience you start to recognize certain patterns  at but then patterns shift I mean when I started out there was no I phone yeah like we're we're doing like there was terrible touch screens and keyboards and things like that so it's only apple introduced iPhone all patterns change so you need to there's you need to be  you need to adapt to your environment because that's also designed shifts all the time you know hatters shift but do principles shipped  I think principles probably remain more constant at the end of the day   I do think they can shift but those shifts are more  society level shift   bigger shift that you see  I mean if you think about it you know ten years ago  would you pay stranger to take a ride in a car Sir an old cells no  but today that's normal  it changes you know how society works and behaves in what we think is okay versus not okay and sometimes  in some places that's not okay and then you know it's like the eight years those are interesting shifts that you see  and it changes nothing design actually has the power to change some of those but that you know  that is something that we don't necessarily control but  I do think that some principles remain fairly constant you can look at designed decades ago and  some decides to design still stands   and but you know they do shift over time but adaptability I think and and maybe related as just your empathy is something that's designs we should all be comfortable with and and and explore  so  unless you have any other questions the smart yeah so  this next series of questions we reached out to the community and we asked them what's burning in their minds so we've got a few questions that we got from them we're gonna ask every guest this also will kick off with this one how do you explain the role of designed to people in Hoover  so luckily I don't have to do too much explaining  that said you still need to communicate and make sure that design frankly has a seat at the table   and the way I look at it is  you know you couldn't create any products  would like but to get it to the next level to really make it amazing and  to get yelled that level of empathy that's necessary you should absolutely leverage your design team at all times because that includes not only how it looks how it works but also you know tons of user research has been done out there  for instance I've been actually driving with uber so I've been a dry  ever because I want to understand the the flip side of this as well  but would I know what it's like to drive in Mumbai India no I have no idea I need to research to tell me what that looks like what I need to go there myself  ill being able to write great content like all the things that  the design team can do  people sometimes forget cell I think it's up to us to make that visible to again tell our stories again and again like even show the difference between something that was designed well and something that wasn't designed well  and I think we can see example of that in in our daily lives in outside of that as well right so  I see it as my job at over to tell those stories and to show evidence of those stories  because the evidence is what makes or breaks it it's like Hey here's this great prosecuted and here are the results and  here's the you know the data behind it like again needs to make sense to to do that so  just being an advocate for design   in a company like over is important always Pushin  so the second question speaking about the roles that design can take  how was the design organization curly structured over   so obviously we have many things going on at the same time  one of the things I noticed when I joined uber is  I thought of it as like okay you got rising drivers and that's it   well that's not entirely true it actually    it's  it's more complicated than that  you lift your list you know Sir like lifting the engine bay and I go okay there's a couple good I've no idea how it works so from things like how do you price things out like how does that even work how do I use it a button and some car move somewhere and come pick you up sounds super simple very complicated   and and we know that people get pissed off when they're you know time of when the car arrived jumps up but  you know that whole it's like it's like a entire orchestra that is in the shadows to to make this happen that's what's so fascinating about logistics but the other thing that I realize is that we are in like hundreds of cities  and  the one thing that I think is unique about we were as well and as designers we can leverage that is all the folks that and then we call them operations internally ops for short are the folks that make things happen in the cities they understand how their city works what the market looks like  they're sort of the the eyes and ears on the ground and I can't really think of other companies that have that type of of knowledge and and and things that can assist and it you know we leverage that  so that's pretty fascinating to be able to to take that into account and designed for for that so how does that translate into the teams like we you mention the writer you mention the driver but   so we have the branding  and we have what we call  of services  because a lot that over is about communicating  and how we communicate from emails to all of those things and then there's a core product even the core product team  the corporate design team is really in charge of things that you you might see in a familiar with where that's rider driver eats  rush hour delivery product and everything  since everything over is two sided market place there is  there's always the two sides of the coin to any product Anna then we have obviously we're working on a ton of his vehicle so  is really in its infancy  but you need to think about those things too  there's many different aspects of what makes  were take and work and how we make bets for the future  that we as a design team product design team cover  and most of it is probably unknown to most people like I would imagine most companies have that you know because apple is not just about the iPhone no although we associate most of it with the iPhone or Facebook isn't just about their news feed   it's usually how many people it takes to build an amazing amazingly great product  so there are people out there listening to this right now that are the only designer in their company maybe there's one or two other people with them right   how would you get them to show the business the business of their and the value of what they do as designers  so I've been there yep what's amazing is that your values absolutely you  media  because you are the only designer  for him by de facto would you you are the value   the difference is like you know it's it's usually if you're the only designer  at the start of for instance even pre launch everything is geared towards getting to that momentous one old product  so  yes I remember there were some lonely times because I used to be I DO but had tons of designs around me engines start up I was the only designer right first of all I thought that my  started experience word and after three months because it felt like a project but it didn't kept going six months since the year two years   and you start to leverage different things you learn how to become more independent as a designer is designed thinker  you you learn how to collaborate very well with product and engineering and probably directly working I mean product is the C. O. probably there's a probably no product managers   is not for everyone  and  I think it you know it takes  I wouldn't recommend it for someone just out of college  can't get some experience like you would recommend be the only designer yeah call yeah that would that would be super hard I mean I've been surprised before his folks that can totally do it but  but I think it's a different challenge you really it's much more existential in a sense that you're  opening a company get to their first product or even if you've already launched it you are the single point of failure  and you'll probably have to make quite a few trade offs and be balanced the you know the desire for for amazing this with an a sense of pragmatism  and the trade off exists both in large and small companies  the bounce can shift ever so slightly and the decision you make a difference but  ill both as some have a written articles about both have their pluses and minuses   and I've enjoyed working in both  and they just represent different challenges but I think if you are going to be the only designer at a smaller company  think making sure that they understand the value is critical because if not it's going to be pretty frustrating experience  Serbia earlier you spoke about narratives and storytelling as a way to help build excitement for project specially for designer  but once that excitement is there and people are bought in the next logical question is what are the goals  and what are the results that we're hoping to to produce right  how should a designer go about the finding those goals and presenting them  so I think at least from my personal experience  with with  were you partner closely with the product teams  you know you  if you look at the data you look at  different things everything around the design  you can just make random bets because at a company like a word that is you know definitely metrics driven someone's gonna ask about it they can say okay tell me you know you're proposing of changing this design   Anil give a quick example like in the old older over experience all products from uber pool too over black to S. U. V. all shown on the same page  we now doesn't scale right but  it obviously gets people nervous when we say no no it's okay we're gonna divided up and it's going to be in sections and is going to be great  sounds good cleans up the interface for sure the next question goes like well how do people get to an S. U. V. like is it discoverable is it not so then we started looking at the data and help people trade often over quarterbacks mostly  order a trade off between look through products  but we also took into account that if you're always riding over black we're not gonna put you in the economy section with over **** Brax that's wrong section for you to starting to use data to actually create meaningful design  and that's how you build a case so the goals the design goal should always be aligned with the business schools  because if you don't do that you gonna get questions and why not right like I would ask the same questions at some point  and it and I think the the the alignment of those goals is what makes it successful and you can get past like you know  thank you know the horrendous feedback of I don't like this design you're like well why don't you like designing you like thirty minutes later you're still not really clear about why a design wasn't working or was working   but making sure you build a good case run your design especially in a larger organization where you'll have to again back to selling you need to do some of that selling you need to show why it's it's better   there is something looking better I mean as desires as well we'll go for but there's also something working better and just in general being better  better is subjective like what's better like I mean if we make more money does better right like I don't care how it looks so  you need to combine all of those variables into one so one one follow on to that question  you spoke about the design goal should be in alignment with the business goals that makes complete sense  it's the best way to like push to those initial friction that you have a stake holders  but what happens in this near where the design is not actually aligned with the business goals  that's not a good design  back to the drawing board   I truly believe that  unless your business goals also not good then you have bigger trouble but I I truly believe that I think it's design I mean then you might as well become an artist right like  that's where you know you're you're really exploring   yourself and and and doing things but I think  I would I would really build a case then why you going against the business school   that's that that could be inching conversation but you have a hard time  missing folks because  you know that's also something I learned during my days I DO and after that is like whenever you go out and you talk to a client like never  never just think that they're they make decisions because they're stupid they're not they know their business best so that's the other thing that when working with Travis that I want to really understand she knows this business like no other amazing it's understanding that and being able to still it is another  responsibility we have a designer so if you're going against that business school a big business school right because if it's a small one you can make trade offs say like well I am willing to forego two percent here to gain five percent there now now that's interesting and we had some of that at over as well where you know I'm still I'm sure some folks are still frustrated about their pick up location and where's my driver and I'm right here to map says I'm right there so we you know we decided to trade off certain things  like speed and making sure your GPS more accurate  to get that down the final not a problem is if we do get it wrong  it does piss people off more now   so but that's a tradeoff you make so  so I think it's either either you're aligned or do you better have a damn good story why you're proposing to change it but you can't as designs we can't come to the table along with that I mean getting it laughed at like I mean I don't spend my days doing sequel query understand it it is expert for that  data analysis product managers that that's their job to like you know make sure this functions correctly self  yeah never always always question always go back and  reason why something is why it is sometimes it's silly but yeah they're still reason usually was so we can begin and with this last question   as the role and function of design starts to evolve what are some ideas or methodologies or other roles that you think will emerge over the next five years  I think about this a lot because at times I get disappointed by the tools that were given to me sensually most of his photo shop  I personally never really was good at photo shop  I see some trends now that are pushing the envelope more   and I think it design is gonna you know a lot of people talk about chat bots were still trying to figure out what's actually good about it but I certainly have no interface not really  you have an experience so I think what we're you know in this this sounds kind of cookie cutter but I think it's designed really creating experiences at the end of the day  the methods we use today are  is a phone screen a table cop Bankrate like this allows me to  lifted up and and and be able to drink from it  not burn my fingers by the way   but you know that is something that continuously evolves right  now we're really  it's phone centric fan's gonna go beyond that you already see with the art yeah it's amazing for games but with love it love it love it this is great but you know  and chat bot Cindy everything is shifting around this and we'll have some more good years with with the things in our pocket because they're pretty amazing  but I think it's how do we  are we keep up with that and what are some of the things that change  because speaking of science fiction you know  sure some folks have read ready player one minutes use use use in a suit you're just in a world that is not real anymore it's just I mean it probably feel real  and that's where we are going to go at some point but what is that mean but also you can I I think we're gonna see a reaction the opposite ways like kill all technology I'm done with it I'm going to go on a hike somewhere  I don't know where it's going to go but I know that right now we're super focused on that phone screen everything you see is about that phone screen  I think that's gonna shift so I think designers  I mean it's not like you today needs only to think about everything outside because and you know  you gonna come back to the office and you're gonna like do also should crazy things and they're asking what's next week  but you know I first ten years today now than ever before that it's kind of insane right and  figure another ten years will what will be old I'll be really old but we'll probably see here and have a different type of interaction with technology  but that's what's so exciting right like you know like a  rolls are redefined I mean if you think about Tom's vehicles   you you remove the driver you remove a big part of the customer experience  saw what is I mean like is it is the car going to talk to you some kind of weird right like this robot talking to you yeah  who knows who knows but  that's that's the future that that will be very interesting and that's where  I we like to think of it experiences in general so as the interface attrition is the experience will continue to be king is absolutely yeah I think that never change their some well you know you can't really replace  a good dinner by away that's also an experience   I hope so can take the food out of the dinner  we've we've tried try and they're still trying but it's it's about experiences I I truly believe that and and people are willing to  to do interesting things angle long ways to have great experiences well thank you so much thank you  Hey you made it to the end congratulations thanks for

       " \"I was losing my name's Bobby Gosho and shared around it were sitting down with twenty five masters of the design industry if you join us for the last couple weeks we certainly been learning a lot we hope you've been learning a lot we're gonna continue to do that we're gonna sit down we're gonna talk about how the best companies in the world approach communicate and a poor design every single day in this episode we're speaking with Dave Littmann date is the B. B. design anyway to focus on his years at apple where he was the creative director of online retail how and when to use intuition versus data and how eBay users data  get to the episode after this quick message from our partner so stick around  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  Dave thanks for joining us thank you have a beer awesome  so first question what's one thing about design that's clear to you that you don't think so but other people    maybe it's maybe it is clear I don't know that the thing that comes into my mind is that there is this this tension as a designer between creativity  craft and being strategic  and that is like this concert  tension that I think all designers tend to feel in one shape or form  and when I you know when I grew up and went to college and all those things like it was all about craft it was all about craft and was all but the craftsmanship of being a quote unquote designer and I think that there's been this shift over over the years obviously where  you know you can't just show up without one component one that one skill set and  I think we haven't figured out as a as an industry  which one of those things leads in which one of those things are seeds and I think probably varies from moment to moment but I think that's something to me that I'm just I constantly see our teams  trying to balance but we don't really talk about it  or we haven't talked about a lot the past and it's something that just sort of continues to be popping into my head lately  that I'm not sure if it's if it's fully understood by  by others how do you how do you know when  this specific one should read because your point I mean there are times where you actually yeah yeah I mean I think part of it is what the problem as you know  I think that's probably the biggest the biggest thing  I also think it's you know  well I guess I guess it's probably the the biggest part is is what's the problem we're trying to solve  and   when are we in the process and  one of the outside factors that are sort of pushing us through these decisions  so I think that's it for me I think it's bridge really does come down the problem  do you do you bring some visibility and do you spend a lot of time bringing visibility to the business with the designers that you work with that do you get them involved with  the executives pitching's  the fact that absolutely it's part of our sort of growth trajectory at at eBay is to make sure that  the people who are responsible for the decisions of you know a product design decision  are are accountable for the things that they the the decisions they make and have the opportunity to share the rationale and  you know doesn't happen every single day like when it's not just a parade of designers walking into the CEO's office and saying this is the thing I made in this is the thing you know  but we we just try to spend a lot of time making sure that  everybody knows how to articulate and defend their decisions as as a designer  and it's it's it's good for everybody what are some of those exercises like   cutting in so you spoke about making sure that everyone else had articulated the fan yeah  I don't know if we have like a formal training regiment in terms of like how what that is  I think you know the the the the framing that we try to  set forward is you know you know always need to be set in context so that people understand and for us  customer is the is the context that we're always trying to to to bring to light  you know there's lots of forces within sight of any successful company it's the there's the internal forces there's the business and then there's the customer  and we sort of fashion ourselves as champions of the customer to make sure that were always bringing the customer to the foreground  and so it's super important for us to set the context of you know what their problem is what their journey is what the opportunities are around them   and make sure that we have a strong articulation of that before we get into any sort of like presentation of now what a what a solution might be sort of a lot of people know this but  you spent three years at apple before you before you came here at at  before that you your partner at your own small design firm that's right you left to go to apple  I find really interesting is the timing of the whole thing you went to apple in twenty eleven  you  while you were there for three years grew into  the head of the retail online retail yeah the design their credit credit doctor for yeah yeah exactly   and you joined when when you know Steve was still alive you know he wasn't there but he was certainly a presence yeah how did how did design change like the approach to design the way people talked about products  during the three years since Steve's passing yeah you know it's it's funny and I think it's  sort of highlights the the the notion that you know the the train never keeps the nerve to the train never stops right doesn't matter who you are what you do and I think that's you know it was really evident at apple after Steve died that   nobody ever I mean there is an emotional break for people where that that that meant a lot and they questioned about you know what the what was gonna happen with the company  but everybody just kept making the same thing they they kept making  there is not really a change in either us or  philosophy or anything like that  you know there were some decisions that I think  Steve had drawn a line in the sand about around the role of E. commerce and  are getting that we were able to challenge a little bit more after he wasn't there but the the day to day of of  how apple operated as a design sort of a legacy of of a strong design culture and it was sort of built in   from day one I think  release from the time I was there it never really change that much  which you know isn't that interesting a story but it's actually kind of kind of a testament for them for the yeah the origination  at  and now the role of the designer and apple contrast to designers here at a bank and this could involve yeah process thing arms on  you know I think the day to day of what a product designer  does at apple and does it eBay at least in the groups that I was I was a part of with the commerce and and some extent and and marketing side of things wasn't terribly different  you know I think the biggest differences are as going to a little bit before is  that the the place the the the space that a designer occupied at at apple  it was elevated right like design is it apple is a design company if your designer apple and if if you're a finance person at apple design is what is done there  and so   no that's not necessary that wasn't the case at eBay and that's not a bad thing  I think ninety nine percent of the start ups that happened in that era yeah design wasn't a thing and so  there's a low like most companies there's a lot more  work to be done to bring design to people for  within within the within the organization yeah if we if we just like climbed a little bit higher and I'm so that's the role of designers in the organization the role of E. commerce so yeah right eBay like that is the thing well yeah  verses at apple right yeah so how they what were the what with the different ways that the apple approached E. commerce versus yeah you're doing  well I think to that very point it sort of taught at that that one point about  you know at apple St  ecommerce as just a sales channel right at eBay it's the channel yeah there's just one business that the brand and its E. commerce and it's a two sided marketplace and  which is incredibly complex  and so   at apple you ray because you were just a one of many sales channels any commerce you you could push the boundaries  and not have a massive impact both in a good in a bad way  at  on the company right like you could you know switch out  the website with the image map and probably still  so close to the same end of things because people just there yeah luxury items that people really want  then at eBay  and but there's a downside to that at apple's well because you wind up toiling around the edges and you don't really have that much of an impact and customers a lot of this trip  and it's actually the probably the biggest thing that  pulled me away from apple to eBay was this opportunity to impact an entire business  and for designed to be one of the change agents to help bring about what a new a bank might be   so that to me that's like that's the the opportunity for impacted eBay I think for any designer is the thing that that gets a lot of people out about  that you're impacting the entire business not just this little portion of it is pretty well known to about using data quite objectively to make decisions yes curious was that new when you came here is that because I think everything I've heard about how apple that's the yeah yeah so coming here that must have been some sort of a shock right yeah I mean you could so you could say that I mean I think  if you were to try to quantify it  you know apple is a relatively intuitive organization and sort of collectively intuitive  operating off its own got  and they do it  their way and they they make it work  and eBay like most other companies  utilizes data  and it's actually not a bad thing it's a great thing like why wouldn't you want to have a day or so  why wouldn't you want to have more ammo for understanding your customers are understanding opportunities and problems  especially as a designer  so yeah so it was it was a shock to the system but a very exciting shock to the system from A. like something that I felt was absolutely missing  in previous experiences  at apple was the idea that the customer actually be here  then we can actually learn so but I find interesting this intuitive driven culture apple versus a data driven culture anyway  going from one to one did you were there any elements of apple that you brought over yeah I think   one of the things that I think can can be the downside of of relying on on either one of those things completely is that you you are unable to make a decision when the thing isn't there so at at at eBay or fear of you for making a new product or a new experience and if there is no data how do you how can you know how do you actually know for making the right thing and if you if you only just rely on data to make judgments  you that other part of your atrophy is right that other part of the of of your ability to make decisions after fees and that's what one of the things I observe when I got here and it what it wasn't  it wasn't   terrible in that sense but I what I saw was a lot of folks who which is a  let's just see what the data says and and saying that about everything as opposed to saying about the things where it truly made an impact  and so   we tried this we spend responded this amount of time my first year here trying to help   rationalize who when it was  intuition kind of call versus the data kind of call  and I think that that's that that team's appreciate that and that's that's something that I think is a designer you're always trying to balance those two things  and I think even as a product ochre or engineering folks they would they would agree that like having some way to to balance those things would be really really good certain that balances K.  what were some of the signals that you guys identify to decide between intuition verses data   you know I think   one is understanding what data is available  and when it's available as it is  an important part  than the kind of data right so if you have all quantitative data and no qualitative data you understand what happened but you don't understand why  and if you all the have qualitative data you'll understand why we don't know what happened right it's hard because you don't have the amount of data that you need  so one is just understanding the data  understanding its relevance to the decision that's being made  and then you know I think on the the other side of it is   when you get to that other side of of your intuition you know one of the sort of goofy questions that we would sort of   make sure we asked ourselves was  do I love this thing like what I want to use this like do I care about this thing do I even care about this feature I think it's a good idea and if not  like in one of my doing what data might doing what what data my finding to help me make an art you know find an articulation of why I feel this way about this so that was  we had a set of   operational principles for the design group and and one of them was I love this thing and it was this sort of like checklist of things as a designer  working on our teams that you know do you love it and if you do great if you don't like maybe you should now keep working on it  keep iterating it's interesting since data doesn't have taste  now I haven't seen in a maybe it does maybe maybe we don't have to as a data has days but who knows yeah  I'd like to go back to the moment where you decided to come to eBay I was a big decision right you're leading a design yeah right yeah yeah well I mean I I think I'll be leaving the job is a life  the same last right into telling her he and and and you're you're leaving a design led company with a history of design into a company where  eBay needed you to bring your design sensibilities to work with the executive level so yeah  and really help  bring eBay India design last company let yes right so that's a big decision yeah  so that we you nervous when you when you first approach that opportunity did you think well yeah yeah I mean I think there is there is a bunch of parts to it I mean I think you sort of articulated both the  and the part that would make you totally nervous and and and skeptical of it but it also illustrates the opportunity  that's right the challenging after usually connected to each other if there was no way that a call yeah I totally and so and on a daily basis during the decision making process I would either error on one side or the other I just keep flipping and see which and when it ended up  but I think that in this sort of goes back to something I was saying before about like  won the opportunity to impact the entire company through design was a huge huge huge class  it was  at a scale that I haven't  been out before you know going from  leading a team of like fifteen or so people to a much larger team  you know and and around a hundred or so  big big change  they got all the call that an order of magnitude that is that as a water magnet  and I think the other thing for me I think there are some cultural parts  that I continue to weigh around  transparency within the organization decision making within the or  and  and then just as the again that opportunity to help transform a company right  I tend to and most of my life have   I found myself gravitating towards the underdog  and apple was a little bit anomaly in that sense  and I think  eBay is not the underdog by any stretch but I think  very very successful business but the opportunity to help transform it and become a designed  you know I I a player on that list of of design led companies whispers huge  and so you know   I think and then I think the last pit bet that flips the decision for me was around the company's purpose   know apple makes incredible products and that's really cool  to be around but I think the thing that about eBay in terms of just what its impact on the world is it you know it's a it's a two sided market place that if you have an entrepreneurial bone in your body you can and you can sell things like you can find financial freedom yeah  and that's an incredibly empowering them  thing to wake up and think about every day  and so for me   that was that was that was that was kind of the biggest thing I think at the end of the day and then the last bit is as a designer designing  a two sided market place is way more interesting and way more complex than like a traditional retail side  so many more problems to solve  so  they're people listening with us right now who probably have  I probably have a very similar decision to make right they have career opportunities and they need to make a big decision about whether they should pursue something new or kind of stick in the role yeah  that they're in now   on the one hand  you have to be patient right so yeah I'm I'm curious as to how much patience plays into that decision making process without being overly react they were just jumping at the next shiny object yeah I don't know  I don't know if I'm necessarily refute classify as a patient person I don't know how qualified yeah I am to answer that what I  I I think it's you know everybody's balancing act is like   complacency verses  you know just  anxiousness to go do something else right like how like how do you know if you're being complacent or if you're just happy yeah  verses your restlessness is actually a sign that you should go or you should just your maybe not thinking about it right  and so I think that those two things like in life were all sort of fighting that fight on a daily basis and I don't I don't know if  turn of people's careers are any different than that and   you know I guess the the thing that I would say is like  you know do you like the people that you're around you learning are you making things that you love do you believe in the place do you believe in the company  and  what it how do you balance that against the opportunity like I don't know and you know maybe you just need to make a checklist and objectively put him down those the the two columns   but I I tend to gravitate towards those other things sort of like in life like are you getting what you need out of it I enter your is your impact measurable if that's something that matters to you  out I just I wonder seniority plays a role in this though because  I put that kind of change doesn't happen overnight right so you can come the eBay and magically design became a thing like you right is working hard at it with the executives here and we'll get into that but  you know these things tend to play out in chapters yeah yeah you kind of first need to start establishing some principles and ground ground work in frame a framework for non designers to understand the role of designed yeah you kinda work your way toward hopefully  getting the kind of work that would lead to good design and then you hopefully get to a place where you ship good design right yeah   is there a way to like identify  where you are in that is probably not a linear map like where you are in so you've spent three for one year at a place and you're not happy baby unhappy because you probably stick it out just a little bit longer you things need to get kicked in again like I yeah how do you poke at that like figure that out  that's a great question  I mean I think maybe part of it is   like what you see and what what what are the things that you're seeing that are leading you to believe that you're either being successful or not successful  because often times in my experience anyway especially when you're talking about like change right  change is really hard  means people have to do something differently and  you know one of the things like thinking about  just my time at at eBay like  urban moments where it feels like nothing's working   and big because you know I'm getting pushed back from people or are you but that's just people trying to rationalize something new in their lives right  and so it's important to when you're looking at the things that seem like maybe they are going well you know it what it what it what is behind that with a layer behind that like  is actually a sign of something good yeah right if people are actually rationalizing the change that means they're trying to understand and they're trying to they're trying to figure out how to use it or maybe rejected but they're actually  they're paying attention is right and  I think we all have had experiences where you know the ultimate sign of failure is like just total apathy right there  but he's even paying attention and  maybe that's a sign right like maybe if there's just complete like disregard in every possible way for the thing that you're a waking up in the morning   you know maybe that's a sign that  things are going the way there with the way you want them to  but again it's you know if you just take a single a single data point and try to analyze that data point into a think about it over time  you can get in a bind something with everything we do  so we spoke about some of the questions you ask when you're deciding whether to leave  but what are some that someone should be asking themselves when they're deciding where to go   well I think   there's a bunch of    I think the the the biggest one that I would say especially as you're getting a little bit  well no I think at any point your career like what kinds of problems that you're going to be solved yeah right like that was the that was for me  leaving my designed comp that part company was a partner at to go to apple  I went from solving like  he   in a pretty basic  design problems I've been selling for a long time to something totally new for me    that's a big deal and then going from apple to eBay I went from this notion of   polishing the edges of you know quote unquote diamond  to like helping transform the company yeah so like I think thinking a lot about just the kind even if it's even if it's still you're still making things from job to job but like  what is the company do like what they stand for  how many people make an impact there  how are my decisions going to  change people's lives  or not change people's lives I think so for me I think those are that's probably the biggest thing is just like what kinds of problems do you want to solve   at the other one that's important for me and I I suspect for everybody else's like who the people are gonna be surrounded by on a daily basis like you like them would you go out to dinner with them like if you if you don't go out to dinner with them or hang out with them   is that you know that's that's a hard thing to do so it's my it's my own personal sort of   but I think it's a big part of just  how you're going to spend your time is and and who you're gonna spend your time with his like  sort of the fundamental question of life yeah without it sounds like you need to know where you want to grow   and you need to know who  what makes you happy yeah because it's your job to be happy rates cut your it's on you know it's going to do that for you and I think the other I I learned this  awhile ago  using  was    everything changes  and like   an inferior interviewed for a job a long time ago and  you know I was an interview process as like a our director or something and I asked the question of like you know where do you see when you see this role being in two years and we see successes like that the quintessential be like I'm here to do the interview  kind of question button that is like  and the guy just looks I mean he's like  stay here because every single thing that we're talking about right now in six months is going to be totally different and so you need to make a decision about like this company and me is your boss and a couple of other things  and  it's partially about what do you want to learn what's missing but it's also just about like truly  you're you're you're going to spend your time here with these people and  I think that was like sage advice and I would I would absolutely I believe it one hundred percent  everything's a  isn't it changes all the time and where you go in thinking and what you come out like literally in a couple weeks probably totally different authors options of the wrong and everything will change  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work  here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  of course we're inspired by our design program which is over sixty years old  today IBM employs more than one thousand three hundred professional designers and we've certified more than sixty thousand IBM verse in the practices of IBM design thinking  the result  divers teams working more closely than ever with our clients their users and our partners to create modern solutions  provide differentiated human centered outcomes to the world we'd love to share the story more closely with you  and I hope to see you soon at one of our IBM studios worldwide  I would also like to thank our friends and envision for their support invision is the world's leading product design platform powering the future of digital design through their deep understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One every Indy and that plugs let me tell you three reasons why I use it one poor communication is one of the biggest blockers for talented teams to we don't get  the back from others early and often you can get lost in the woods and that's just bad for everyone and three without a prototype it can be hard to show others your full vision for the sign invision solves all of that you can rapidly prototype at the front end of the design process and collaborate across every stage of the project it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers and developers and writers teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when they use envision sweet a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision apps are calm and use our access code I envy dash high resolution for three months free  today's take us through your first six months in the bay  especially the things that you prioritized neon  long time ago  you know I think it's  a lot of it is something and everybody would do right like meet everybody just get to know every single person that was on the design team that for  and not just on the design team but my partners in the business product marketing all that kind of stuff  and truly I try to understand like what matter to them and what the problems were  and when you're in a company as big as eBay  and that takes that takes like six months like it took a really long time even if I just broken down into ten minute intervals like was meeting with a couple other people trying to actually make sense of any of that well appointed you start actually doing the work  I was the price of  it's not work  yeah well I think that's that's that's part of it right because  I think what we all all learn as designers at some point is like you're wrong all the time like your assumptions are totally wrong and you know when I walked in here and took the job I had my assumptions as of like why isn't eBay shipping the products that we all think they should be shipping  like is it a problem with design is a problem product is a part you know like all of those kinds of things and  until you actually talk to people and listen to people and try to and spend sometime analyzing that like it's impossible to know right like  there's been a lot a lot of time doing at a lot of time doing that   you know I had  we did actually ships and stuff beef in that six months that I was here  thing that happened I was  pretty fascinating was   we went through  a couple of fire drills  around from a technology standpoint that   dropped me in with a bunch of people that I had had never met before on like that you know serve crisis mode kind of  you know five days in a room together war room style  and that was  the best crash course in understanding this business that that I have in any of my experiences  both building the bonds with the people that I now consider you know close our partners and friends  but also just learning indeed  on the fly of like what it means to make decisions here  and that was a that was a really  unscripted and important thing I would I busted  my bosses chops for a couple months after asking if that was just like a hazing like his I just what they do to everybody they just kind of with a fire drill and  turns out it wasn't it was just that just me  so  you know back XO adds to sort of I think what it every designer does whatever you're trying to solve a problem right you  you know it's like design thinking one a one and you're trying to understand you're trying to  make some informed decisions and then you're like I think that was my friend and I know that's pretty abstract  but I think as I was learning the people learning the pain points learning what the opportunities where where we're being successful what success actually looked like I think that was kind of the biggest thing I sort of mention this before of like   everybody has their own version of what right is and spent a lot of time trying to understand that and then how that map back to the company like what the company saw is right ands trying to find a delta is in there  and so that was a lot of the first six months there is organizational work that had to be done there is process work that had to be done   one and  if you guys are interested in that kind of stuff around   one of the things that we that we instituted not long after I got here and it was   is an interesting it was a it was a interesting maneuver and potentially painful it was  very painful for the team here  was we start instituting design reviews executive level design reviews  and very single project that was going through some   and if you can imagine  an entire product design tech organization that didn't have to do that before hand that now all the sudden had to go through this gate  yeah  the change looks different and are there a lot of people I can I'm here so the first one I actually felt like from here would you guys like to like it was that hazing for that designer like  right it was it was a pretty it was a pretty fast and you know it sort of goes back to  talking about the question of who is actually where we identified the  the question of do you love this thing yeah  we're sitting in is our interview  like second project to come through  and  you know designers presenting his work  and he's like what worst body language I would just like crumbled over  just so bombed out about everything that they were presenting them and  product manager sitting there right next to them engineering leads right next to them so it's like the whole teams presenting  and so I at some point  I pause and I was like so do you actually believe in this thing that you're presenting I do actually like this and  and you know he he looks over the product manager in primaries like  no I'm not used to like  and he said I said no non and I thought that was like a really brave thing to do and it was like a  a really powerful thing for me to to learn of a like a powerful insights and to learn about like what was happening underneath   and you know at that I think the the thing is that in like next time we talk like  you should show what  you love I do the other thing to do the thing that somebody else thinks is writer that the the the that's been road map or prioritize but also make the thing that you think really does solve the problem for changes the problem  and let's talk and we'll see which one attack  we'll see which one the data proves out is is right around and will probably be right fifteen of the time but at least you know  we have that and so  it was really hard for the teams to go through that because adjustments this whole new process  but it was really important for myself and for my boss to just  understand all of the work that was happening I was like the first part of it was just for us to see every single feature product that was getting put out into the world  and so you know we created a final where you know that with the final is hard because it's late actually slows down execution and slows down productivity  but it was super helpful  because we could learn and we could also  help share out what we thought was important as well as it as it is like a design leadership team and help  not to say that we are right but just the things that we thought were important  because I that's begins like stand on stage and say that stuff but in the end the only really comes to life when you're down with somebody making those decisions together  before the final helps invest the other people in the day yeah as well right yeah it's a very abusive usable yeah transfer process yeah so we did that  it's hard it's really hard for people  but it was valuable I think most people would say that it was a valuable tool we have since been lack of let that relax a bit because we don't want to be a commander control company where absolutely trying to push as many decisions down into the teams as possible    but it was a valuable tool at that at that moment  learned a lot from that just that one what what's different about so we got the picture of the year for six months here and what you prioritize then of course you understanding the world eBay was the most important thing back then  what is it today what do you what do you days look like what do you  focusing on  it's a great question   email   keynote   no  I think I spent  I I would say that I spend a lot of time  on alignment  that's probably one of the biggest things  making sure that people  on in the design organization understand the context for why are companies doing things   and why those why does that why we're doing this and why those things matter and why those why they're important to do  and helping bring people along  and then on the on the on the flip side is helping  executive leadership of the company understand  continued understand how design can play a big role in  continue to transform the company  so a lot about it is is a around contacts around of it a lot of it is around alignment  and and a lot of it is  continuing to bring to light   the important role the design complain so it's even though it's three years and it's a  it's an everyday job job security man to have security there we go yeah now it's super important    what are the decisions that the design organization I hear the vice president designed for email option right in what are the designs that your organization is responsible for the decisions that my organization is responsible for    you know it's interesting   if I tried to pinpoint like the the actual decisions that the team is responsible for  if I could I don't know if I could pinpoint that because I think it varies per team and I think it varies  in the moment  you know I think people like the the pretty obvious answer is like the end and customer experience  and  how that all maps together yeah  and how    you know how we actually how we actually managed to create greater experience for people  but I think I think it's just saying that design owns a decision I think it's actually a problem   so  you know it's hard when when ownership is distributed right like when decision making is distributed it's can be very very hard  but I think  one and when it's wife its design making decisions versus product making decisions verses engineering making decisions versus marketing making decisions  like when you get into a turf war  and I think what what we try to spend our time focusing on is  making sure the team is accountable and and with that comes the decision making the decisions that go along with that so it if the scrum team is responsible for you know a user experience decision it's not just the designer being like what's my  I made the I'm the designer and so this color red is  I've chosen  feel good again I in it is my decision and so you know like  like those those days I think are gone  you know I think there was a moment in time probably up until about ten years ago   design still was mostly rooted and  graphic designer product design where you have like  a designer it's about the designer right it's about the designer you hire to make the logo for you right like you hire Paul rand to make a palm and logo and there's no questioning that and it's just him and his way and that's it  but you know creating  interactive experiences is  center on people it's not centered around it's not self centered its user centered right and I think   we went through this transformation I think problems like her ten or fifteen years ago but we never really reconciled it as it is what it means for a designer to add in for for myself like going I went through that transformation without even knowing it yeah  but it is like if you're you know if you're sitting there just trying to own decisions as a designer  especially in a product design organization  and that's the thing that matters to you it's going to be hard it's gonna be it's gonna be hard because you just don't  system the way it's just not the way it works anymore and I don't think anyway  and I think you know you can like  owned the you know how you organize your sketch files  that's super cool now there's like everybody everybody out there like list of things like I don't know that that now but like I think  we're all better for it if if the teams responsible  for the decisions out so when design is communicating its function to executives to see levels  what should they be focusing on then is it implementation is a process outcomes money and this is tying back to the fact that the responsibility the product is owned between other roles as how to design  I think it varies I think it's going to vary from team to team from company to company culture the culture by I think it's so it's hard to just ten point exactly   what that means across companies and but I would say at eBay  like  for us it's about making sure the customer and  contact is represented that's like ballot like we have to balance the customer need an opportunity with what the business wants and needs  and so for us that's a big part about it  and it's you know I think you can probably try to get up to the three things and it's  sort of how we look at it  especially within our research organization you know what products remaking what products should we be making this what is the experience of that product and then what is the interface of that product  how is it use and like I think if you sort of  view chunk those things out like that's probably a pretty good way to to think about it and it'll you know the presentation of the contacts will will vary depending on  you're talking about it but I think those are pretty good sort of  rex to to sort of look at things and to   and it's a it's a good way if you can build some vernacular along those lines across teams and across the exactly there should be a walk into a room and say okay we're talking about the interface today we're talking about the experience today we're talking about the the what the product is and you know conceptual eight  it's it can be a valuable way to sort of articulate that and so that's I think that's  and it's again it's not the things that to just design presents its with the team presents and what's the team is is is is trying to push for what would you tell a business leader  that's on the fence about investing really investing in design  I like this mark  I would tell them  that  it's going to  take a long time for the change to happen and I would tell them that it's going to cost a lot of money out I'd tell them that it's the designers are a pain in the ****  and that they're gonna question everything  and I tell them  that we're gonna  blow stuff up  and we're gonna  we're gonna take a day of it out of out of your profits if and if they're still excited after I say all those things to them then I know that like were actually having a real conversation because they actually truly understand like how important is  I'm not saying to go do that had  I don't know you know like say if that's not like Dave's foolproof checklist to like food you know and  impress upon an executive the value of design but I think  again it goes back to sort of  managing change right like that everything we're talking about is change and   it requires  tenacity and it requires fortitude to to do it and if if you're just sort of like I don't know this design thing sounds like it's cool  maybe it's not right for you    I think it is right for you maybe you're just not ready for it yet need more and more   a better understanding of it  I think the last part of it is  then I would impress upon something at right would be sort of looking out to see how an executive responds is  by investing in design  you're not investing in something else opportunity cost and so  what are you willing to give up what are you willing to do you prioritize so that design can actually happen here   and the good seo would say nothing because that's their job is to have cake and eat it  but it's the you know those are  this important questions to get into because all they're all true like and we can sugarcoat it all we want to say like  but just wait until you see what you get at the end which is also  a super important part of it but I think understanding that there are real trade offs  to making something like this happen is a big deal  so assuming somehow someone talks to see  when they drop all those things the sign is a pain in the **** to work with that thing in there without a profits all these things and somehow there's there's still room still listening crane from him  and then from there they give you some free way to bring designed to this organization Marin  three months down the line six months down the line like what should they be looking for to show that this is actually working graphite progresses down  I feel like we talked we talked a little bit before of   you know there's the outcomes right like the outcomes like great product experience great acts experience  with you know everything up into the right is  I think that's what everybody wants you know and and things of design as a silver bullet   and what I I think we were talking about before was like you know   are people actually engaging it is  their attention is their debate about the efficacy of of what we're doing if that's in there if that's happening that's like actually a good chunk of people actually try to rationalize it  I think you know a little bit further down the line  when other people outside of design talk about  the value of design you know you're on to something  right when when you are not when people are doing your job for you you know that like your onto it  when you have people and the product organization number saying this happens ever but if you had people on a product organization  bring up their head count for designers or giving their budget to design you know you're on to something  you know that you're making traction within that within the company  and those are you know  their their status to that right  but I think it's you know you start to see how people accept things and then they start to make their own  and we're having a lot like an eBay were having more success with that right now were a lot of the things that we've been piloting over the past six months are now being adopted by the product organization  and part of the you know the initial response is okay that's our thing we we made that happen away man like  that means that if it matters so much to the organization that there were there willing to they want to take ownership of it and so for me like there's no better sign   of of of our success is when the rest of the company starts doing search thinking my designer starts doing like  Niners starts embracing it and taking ownership of that  close to this leads us to a series of questions that resource from our communities we reached out to a bunch of people in the community and we asked them you know what's kind of burning up in their mind at the moment we have a few days so we're gonna go candies with you now let's do this okay so  yes our first our first question is  how do you explain the role of design to people at the bay  I've done it a lot   I think it varies depending on who you're talking to  I think the role of design   as I see it right now is is again I sort of feel like a broken record is to like  bring the customer to life understand the opportunity as it relates to the customer and help actually manifest that that experience for them like that to me is kind of   a really important part of of everything that we do and that's the thing that we have to continue to push on and   you can't do wrong by bring the customer life   another question we have is how is the design organization  structured a bank account  perfectly    well the     without like getting in front of a white board and drawing and organizational chart  we are we're getting  yes is  yeah  so we're we're we're organized  around to sort of Maine  areas and one is the work that we do like we have  brand design team and we have a core product team and we have a  new product design team  and they're working on different channels basically   so they're organized by  the part of the business a support and then we have then we organized by  function right so we have researchers and writers and  designers and programmers and operations people and so we're sort of organized around those two principles  and the functions feed into into the work streams  we set within the product design organization so I reported to the SVP of product  and but we serve  pretty broad set of company outside product as well  when you're the only designer in a business there people by the way listen of this that are in a start up or even hard company whether a team of two yeah   how do you explain the value of design to the non designers in the company    thanks  I think that's a good that's a great question   I find that and it depends on what kind of design you're talking about are you talking about design thinking or you know because I'm the capital D. E. or you know the the activity of making  product  that that once that's a hard one to if you're at that level where people are like well I might have an engineer friend who can just make that as I if you're out  that level then that's a  it is hard one  I think what I found is  explaining it to the people is the hardest thing to do and just doing it there is the best thing I ever gonna do a workshop tomorrow design thinking workshop and we're just  spend  thirty seconds talking about what design thinking is and then just get into a workshop please  and spend two hours with a bunch of like sea level folks  with me now they're gonna they're gonna be sitting there with aluminum foil and pipe cleaners and all this kind of fun stuff  and  to me that that is the best way is to do it in practice and to  bring them all and make them part of the process as opposed to trying to articulate  in some well constructed you know theoretical  dissertation  about the value of design I think just get into it show than the value of it  another question we have is how do designers at eBay measure and present the results of this is coming from a place of you know designed for whatever reason being seen as abject did and that was not tangible yeah just putting it out there like a hoping for the best yeah  well so it's it's in part of it is being you know sort of data driven  and you know there's the  there is there some metrics out there that that are sort of tried and true like there's the AB test there is the the you know the sort of  before after tests there is  the qualitative feedback their survey feedback there's all these things that egg and then there's like an PS you know members girl the  things that I think are not necessarily design oriented but there are tools that designers can use to help articulate the success or failure of any particular decision    the harder part is Matt measuring   the more fungible the more intangible  components of of what a great user experiences right like how you measure delight right even to find a light  they truly how do you do what what is the definition of customer delight and so these are the things that like I don't know how many organizations are many folks  have actually solve that problem  I'm hoping that somebody on one of the other podcasts can basically say here is all of the  manageable here here's the here's the silver bullet  we spend a lot of time  working on that is one of our biggest initiatives as a design organization this year is figuring out a way to design to define and measure customer delight    and  happy report back once we get it  yeah  but it's hard it's really hard   so we'll finish with this last question as the function of design continues to evolve  what are the roles and methodologies that you think will emerge in the next five years now   I can speak you know I don't see the future but  I can tell you just some of the some of the things that we're seeing and  my new product development  team were designing  the buzz words conversational commerce  which  is basically commerce in chat  when we chat messenger Skype wherever   and  for us I guess there's a there's a couple things that are really interesting about it   one it's based on artificial intelligence so designing for systems that will change over time based on user input dynamically that's not a terribly new thing but it's a thing that I think is really interesting in that space because the main interfaces conversation now  so that's that's one I think just   the other part of that around conversational commerce is the main thing you're designing is conversation  and wait and we you know we would launch a product that's inside of Facebook messenger it's called shop bought   and you know we spend a we spent a bunch of time trying to work out   how we can manipulate conversation to overcome some of the challenges with the interface  and so I think what you'll see is the the the skill sets that designers have especially as things go  this is interfaces become more ambient  your inner voice are taxed or something besides the traditional interface that the skill sets that it is a designer require  to have our far beyond  than what we understand right now  whether it's  you know being a great writer    being a philosopher like one of the things were designing where does  the identity of the spot   and so we have lots of philosophical conversations about not like the brand personality but like what is the personality  of this thing there is it human does it no it's no it's a robot if so is it doesn't understand it's kind of a big deal right now like you know like what and so you find yourself like stretching outside of your traditional boundaries of what being a designer does and I think as more of these kinds of experiences come to life the more and more   Amin experiences and artificial intelligence experiences come to life here to find yourself in this place where   making other things you're making you're making decisions design decisions so that other things can make decisions later and that is you know traditionally something that you know computer scientists at and I think that that's gonna happen more more for designers   I will retire by that  skip well yeah well thank you so much Dave thank you again  he made it to the end

thanks for the support what do you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move with squarespace visit squarespace dot com and enter the code high resolution one word for ten percent off your first purchase  Stephen thanks for joining us sure thanks for having me first question what's one thing about designed it's clear to you that you don't feel is quite other people  that's the first question is gonna be fun   I I think that the thing that I think about a lot of the one thing that I think it's clear lately that I think other struggle with is when you think about creative industries thing about designer stuff like that I honestly feel like we're in a time right now we have an opportunity to influence businesses to influence products in a way that I don't think creative the scene since like the industrial revolution I think the challenges that were blown it because I think that there's a little  just when even in the question you asked about when people think about our contribution industries design I'd look at a little bit differently because I think that for me  whether you're an agency where you're increasing at an in house team like me or something like that the contribution that companies once is creativity  because there isn't such an increased demand on how to they separate themselves how do they do things differently how they do things better and a lot of that's creativity and I think that's what they want is they want somebody who can come in and show them how do I have better ideas and then how do I get those ideas out the door in a way that people still care about you because that's the struggle is so many times it gets this kind of like a watered down neuter down sort of a thing so I look at and say look our our focus should be creativity our focus should be on business to move the needle to take advantage of the seat at the table that we've got that we haven't had in decades  the problem is we just focus on design for me creativity's problem solving design is then the visual expression of that solutions so design is almost a by product but I think we we hit this crossroads where we've had the opportunity that's been presented by the industry but then we also have social media which suddenly you look at the troubles you look at the Pinterest you look at things like that that you have created this like internet famous focus on looks  I would love to spend my time with no tech constraints with no budget constraints with no and just design stuff that's pretty yeah they we have to answer for more than just pretty and and I think that's the thing is that there are so many people to just do the design the don't understand the business because they don't understand things like that I think that's the place where you can have that real impact and I think people are just starting to understand that but I think is an end to  then we struggle because we don't actually have the leadership constructs in place for how do you teach people how to do that you mentioned  I Ellison your podcast the crazy one podcast  and you have an entire episode on creativity is a blue collar profession yes I found that fascinating  I think that was the first time I heard it expressed that way can you talk a little bit about what you I mean if you've got an entire hour of it yeah yeah no I do I can I can give you the cliff notes version no I think yeah I mean I think as a reaction to this one for leadership and stuff like that and apparently because I have an allergy to free time I'd started the podcast and I think that one of the things for me was that I grew up in Pittsburgh during the collapse of the steel mills so I'd I really grew up around what were a lot of kind of like blue class working class people and as I'm going on in my career I had one distinct advantage of my dad was a crate of actors I've been a paid designer since I was twelve nice what that taught me or let the let me see was an industry from the time whatever it was like doing paystub teasing cutting ruby less than a whole bunch of stuff if you were after you'll to figure out what it is  I think that what it let me see is that  the idea the concept that ideas are light bald is bullshit like that's not we've all been conned into thinking that it's easy  and a lot of the times I look in trying to figure out okay like what are other industries what are other things I can use to explain what I mean and I think creativity is essentially no different than being an athlete if you talk about a football player they trying to the off season they work through the weight room they do a lot of this stuff to prepare for that moment of greatness to be on the field to catch the ball I think creativity is no different I think that you have to go out and treat it like it's a blue collar profession that it is work because two things one is the  add a labeled as inspiration it's not an idea it's it's identifying an area of opportunity to get you excited  you then have to work and grind through a huge amount of that work to figure out what's the what's the colonel what's the execution how do I get through all the bad to get to the good and again I think this is where a lot of that instant gratification kind of generation suffers with us because they just wanna do it once and be done  so I think there is that issue with it but I think there's also really treat like a blue collar profession because I think if you want to find great ideas if you'll find breakthrough ideas you have to find the opportunities and the moments in which those can live right because if you're an athlete you don't just show up on the field on game dance okay great now may be athletics right right no creative is no different than if you're working a particular industry you're working for a client is going out living that industry it's a living whatever that is so that you can say Hey look there's the consumers are going to work around their their something missing there that was harder than it should be to identify these areas of opportunity that I can then go back and put in the time against to be or have ideas there I think it's also just figuring out like I'd I'd go to chefs a lot I think it's an interesting parallel to the work that we do that I'd look to them for inspiration and I think that like one of the best chefs I ever talked with was the juror on a shelf behind your dreams of sushi and talked about like okay whatever young chefs come in how do you teach them how to be great how do you teach them and the the best explanation around this I ever heard he said like to cook great food you have to eating great food that's fair enough and I think design is the same I think you have to go out and consume whatever you're given medium is I think you have because you need a palette for you okay I found  opportunity I've had the idea how is it any good how do I know if it's gonna resonate with people on just a conceptual execution all levels of I'm not constantly working that palette of I'm not constant putting in that training but that's the problem is all that other stuff is the off season stuff it's thank lessons for opportunity that I don't know when it's going to show up it's not fun it's not like okay I'm gonna go make something I think that's the part of and that's why I talk about is because I think there's becomes such an emphasis was so many designers just on the making  making is gonna dad and your career there's a lot of people can make pretty pictures especially here in New York not hard to find people who can think people who can lead people interventions business unicorns  cool  yeah hi I was just as eating that up  yeah that's awesome so no greater process is the same right  but I imagine in your experience you come across many people straight across the seas and you probably identified some patterns amongst them that I tend to lead to good outcomes what are some of those things I think that a lot of it is one is teaching ever getting them to have the ability to externalize their process yeah too early on it's it's not the concept of fights the concept of we like that's one of the the simple things I do to evaluate team houses which one of those words that they use but how to wipe put whatever my idea is out to a group partially to have them help me write the best ideas I've ever had I did not have a loan everybody has a portfolio they did not created a long but it I so I think that's one thing is again how do I bring in the different perspectives you know to do that but also because I want a group of people the will do who do what I do which is to active  try to break my idea what are the weak spots what are the things that could be better what are the areas that weren't quite thought through because I think we just naturally fall in love with our ideas you had as a white piece of paper we put an ID on top of it there's a personal connection to that irrefutably so okay if I may be able to blinded to that how do I have this kind of advisor group they can come back and say okay look you need to think about this this and this and construct that away that it's not personal but I think there is the ability to externalize that I think that there is the willingness the hunt to fail to fail fast to figure out because I think so much of finding great ideas is finding a lot of really bad ones everybody has that process you start with what is the obvious place that we would start resenting that everybody would arrive then how do I start working out away from that how do I start to push out how do I start to connect those dots differently and I think it was right what talk about before we how are the people or they spot an area of opportunity to maybe other people didn't see I mean I'm I'm joke for years like I mean I've worked on automotive accounts their gas stations I'm banned from in like New York City and in Texas and other places because like I used I worked on Subaru for a long time and I used to go stand at a gas station and wait for like something a WRX to drive up so I go ask about their car you get a guided six foot for walking to the gas station   car people some people love it some people call the cops right like  everybody racks tool to differently but but that was the thing to me was like okay how do I put that idea out there how to like find empathy with it how do I figure out does it really work from I just talking to myself because there's an inherent understanding that I think which is the next thing that you have to have empathy and empathy is not that error  against that says  like a you know I use this product for a little while on the consumer you're not like ninety plus percent of time you're not you need to go out you need to spend time with these people you because there's a difference between what people do and what they say so build that empathy with them and I think like those of the three big ones because it's those ways were how can I put it out there how can I get the strongest idea because I think the people who hold it tight who wanted to be presses you don't anybody to see if you want to treat it like it's a fragile little object the world is not going to treat it like a fragile object though the world is going to treat it as the reality it is that's why I was get very mad when like if somebody put a product out no  we'll fix it to point out consumers understand what the hell to point  as they understand the product it's in front of them and so I think you know those are those are just some of the things but again I think that's the challenge though is that every single person is different so yeah okay so you mentioned  externalize process willingness to fail and the thing right I want to go back to externalizing processor  we spoke about going out there and actually figuring out what are the opportunities and bring it back and especially show to skeptics or cynics this is the thing that's been coming up so basically put holes in your idea right  but for designers listing what is that deliverable or what is that thing that you're putting in front of people because I imagine a lot of people are assuming it's a design and maybe it maybe it's not yeah and and again I think in a lot of times it can be a wide range of things I think it depends on where you are in the process I think that that's a lot of times in a row I work through the process on my work and in the first step but I'm often taking the first I'm taking the testing is a concern is just a conceptual test is to look for where the areas of opportunity when it's kind like where the edges and what point of my going to just simply put IT out there that's passed what can  Chris can stomach it's just gonna be somewhere they don't want I'm talking to myself like there's a lot of that sort of stuff so I think how do I figure out where those edges are and then I think that from there are a lot of times I keep it very deliberately low fidelity it's could be sketches it could just be written it could be it's anything that keeps it from feeling like a design like object because I think there's just a base human psychology that if it looks real people were treated as real you can put every F. P. O. disclaimer in like eighty seven point bright red blinking eat at Joe's Erro type they're still gonna go also is what the button looks like no so I think a lot of it is is starting there with them and bring them along but I think a lot of it for me is also been really teaching them what that process is that this is going to be a journey we're gonna go on together because again I think that that's one of the bigger challenges is how do I bring in my clients how do I take them on that journey with me because if it's just me kind of coming back and just showing them what it is they are really a part of the process and then it becomes much more like yes or no or things like that if I put them on the train if they go with me if they're invested in that nobody wants to jump off a moving train  there's just the base human psychology on the support when I'm a part of so I think that's a lot of it is like look you know because I'll start that by saying look if you want to I'm gonna hold you to your word if you want to be innovative if you want to do something that's truly different we have to understand that we don't know where we're going to end up when we start because I think that's one of the biggest challenges that I see with so many clients as they don't show up for the problem to be solved they show up with a solution to be vetted vastly different things I  thanks for us it's up to us to push back on that to not accept I'm just gonna go color in the lines but to be able to say okay look great on this journey and and that's gonna freak a lot of clients out because as creative as were all incredibly used to that uncertainty we're comfortable with being uncomfortable were used to going out we jump off the cliff assume that we will build our wings on the way down and we're not gonna Wylie coyote in the bottom whatever we get there  nobody else is used to that tech organizations are you so that clients are used to that it's why I see time and time again if you bring in design thinking bringing as a methodology that freaks out the entire company because they're used to go from a to B. and only would be as before they leave a  I think that's a lot of it is how do I get them used to and really like the same hallways coach my team on is like what I want in those moments when I come back with those insights when I come back with that stuff is I want them to know that I may be crazy but I'm not stupid  fast incredible difference crazy is the guy who will take the risk who will try to land and try to do something differentiated stupid is somebody who's just going to either keep inching closer just frivolously rescue and and kind of throw that away  that's the problem because the end of the day if they don't trust me if they don't have confidence in me because I think that's the biggest thing that I'm actually selling that process it's not one particular insight it's not what I'm selling is that they have to trust me if have confidence in me because if any of the work that I think is good goes out the door that has to be there if it's not not it's gonna CLA today  I'd like to go back to failure per second I still think that plenty of people playing designers the instinct is  you want to get it right the first time you're gonna do your best to get it right the first time but I'm not sure   I I've always struggled with  many people saying well you want to fill quickly anyone a bell as many times as possible is it that every time you fail it leads to the inevitability of finding something that works or is it is it by failing you humble yourself by humbling yourself you you you empathize a little bit better what I mean like I think that this thing for me is  there there's kind of an internal and external part of the question right I think from the outside from my clients and things like that I want to bring them along on the journey but that doesn't mean that I necessarily want them to see all of what goes on sure like there's a friend of mine is desired apple I thought of the best description I ever heard he always said look like as an organization what I want is I wanna be a dock on a pond you see it from above you just see that I kind of like smoothly gliding along underneath the water thrashing kicking it's complete mass but that's what I want is I want the reality versus perception I know I think that is the failure is just understanding how or why break the idea what really works and what doesn't and it's not being precious about that I think that you know like I have that kind of thing and whether you're coaching your team you're working on creativity like the first time it happens it's a mistake if you don't learn something from it then it truly is a failure because failing that does not make you a failure and I think that's where people get tripped up because failing it is part of that process is finding out what doesn't work it should be if I go too far I'm gonna again go past what people can stomach or they can do or they wanna be apart over there just not ready for inside to dial it back but as I said just because I'm feeling doesn't mean I've I'm a failure but that that's a part of it for me is okay if I'm not feeling if I'm not having problems of stuff isn't working I'm playing it too safe so the idea is you want to fail not for the sake of  and you want to learn from it what I think you have to because I think like the one thing I have a very big allergy to is like if someone comes in my office and goes over to design this is gonna be our version of insert brand names experience  right leg cover band never change the world right like I do for all we're gonna do is just go through and copy what somebody else did  yes it's safe yes I understand why you would do that no competitive differentiation no brand left no revenue increase no so again like if you're gonna do that he's going to be a future war then let's stop all the conversations about being innovative so I think that's part of it for me is is talking closing with the coaching clients about which one is it a guy one time had a client told me that they wanted a proven innovative idea  a proven to help me I was like that's it for a second right because it literally it was like you can make some rain and stuff but I think that's the thing is is which one is it because if you want to make sure that you're gonna hit this particular mark we can do a lot of testing we can do a lot of those things we can know within a reasonable amount of certainty  but that's the challenges again we're not going to know where would end up in and we need to find out what was what worked what was too far in and to be able to do that so I think that it but I think that's the stigma with it is like  no engine work how do I handle that they're gonna think we don't know we're doing now set up in the beginning and saying look we're going to go get it wrong a lot spectacularly and that's what we want what is innovation then how do you describe it to not necessarily your team to the  the managing up I think for me I did you know it it's a ten it's a tough one right because I think you can take a lot of different forms for me innovation in a lot of cases is solving a problem filling a need and not copying while you do it  and I think but it comes in a lot of forms sometimes it can be big and spectacular I think you know the work that it started when we said okay look the key cards been around for forty years we're gonna go out and completely rethink that because we feel like that that's a moment that could be much easier that we look at that and said okay you know we went back and looked to the consumer and said what are those point of friction I've been on our I've been on a flight for sixteen hours I get off I don't wanna stand at the desk I just wanna go right to my room I have something that they will be able to let me do that I consul you either de magnetized or forget the key card so there's a need there then that that hasn't been Matt so let's go out unless trying to figure out how to fix that that's big that's spectacular press worthy keno where the all that stuff I mean you can be much smaller but but that's the thing to me is like can we look at that and say that this is actually different better it meets a need in a way that it hasn't been done before and I think good but the challenge to that is how do I do it in a way that it actually gets out the door in a form that people still care about because I think so much of innovation people use that word like to know what the hell that means isn't there times companies once I own a release a screen shot a press release about something we might do Sunday not innovative right right press where the not in not innovative but I think that's the thing is it's only people have gotten caught up in that buzz word let's be agile it's the innovative let's be what do you know that means like and then I'll ask the clients will Gluck tell me what what do you think that means that I had I mean I had a fascinating process were whenever I went between start I went to city I would sit down and I so understood that the thing that I needed was leadership that could trusts yeah and even if they couldn't define innovation they could trust that other people could and you'd find some leaders who cut  founder CEO of a huge company and I sat down I said great you know I'm gonna need your support can you define innovation for me he said you know what I really would love it if we could like update the point of sale systems in our stores  thanks for your time gotta go this has been great  out right because that's the thing is it that's not innovation right but that's the thing to me it in I think that for me innovation is also for the fact that it's the willingness to fail because I I think you only find innovation if you're willing to put it out there and know that it's not going to be the huge home run like that was the thing you know that was the ship that we made we found success and star would we said okay look stop doing these huge your long projects were gonna come up we're gonna do an MVP of kilo sort of put into hotels one was here in in Harlem the other one not surprisingly was in Cupertino  and those were the two that I went to ten then I went to a hundred and fifty but it was like look let's do it let's scale let's figure out that if there are five people in an elevator that can become problematic because there's a key reader in there that you have to use it has to work in the gym in the pool it has to like there's a whole host of these other use cases we don't think about but let's start to do that let's fail along the way let's do it in a way that we're feeling smart we're not failing at scale  how do you define diversion and convergent thinking and what do you think it's so critical to our designers create a process I think I mean the thing that I would say is a divergent converts a thinking really comes out of design thinking which really is how do we just give shape to creativity because I think the reason why it's so critical of the reason why understanding it is so critical is because in most cases I interview a lot of designers and they come in and they sit down I'll ask them and also can look tell me how you have an idea  tons of blank stares  right I'm like no like what is what do you do whatever goes right what do you do when it goes wrong and I think most of them don't have the self awareness or don't understand how to use some of your creativity on demand because so much of growth in our industry is the ability to do that if I want to be ahead of design if I want to do things like that I've developed that ability to get feedback on the spot  but I think you know the divergent convergent thinking is just really again this goes back to a blue collar profession kind of question before that it's going through and say okay look I'm gonna have a ton of ideas identify a lot of areas of opportunity I want to diverge and I just want to go for scale how many ideas how many opportunities can I go for and then I want to convert Jonah bring it back together I want to edit it back down but it's not just doing that cycle once it's doing it again and again and again try to try to break the ideas weed out the weak ones find where there are overlaps do that sort of a process to be able to do that but I think again a lot of people you'll see him do it once and either they fall in love with the first idea they have warfare multiple ideas they fall in love with those and so there's a big jump initially but then after that they just kind of is pushing the pieces around much much smaller criminal change after that but it's in sensing okay look we need to make that leap of that size again let's do it like make it just as big push it just as far and it just it starts to kind of weed itself down as it goes with the weaker ideas will start to fall out the stronger ones will start to rise will start to Polish those and it gets that kind of sine wave that starts really big and starts to kind of trail off to a fine point but that's why I think it's so important for me is like I said  I think so much of creativity in the industry as well  somebody's eyes just happenstance  and so I think you know that's that's the challenge ET for leadership perspective on coaching perspective I think that's why it's so important to to understand concepts like that says it's giving is also giving younger less experienced designers a framework to think   yeah right that I would I would argue even bigger than that because I think is when we go back we talk about it if if our charges bring creativity and what company  a big part of it is the fact that like if my product is just design I can put out a visual artifact I can do in a certain amount of time especially for an internal team I've done a fantastic job of making my team a commodity  because of the fact that all I can do is deliver on a deadline if my product is then creativity even a shift happens not all one in perception because my group instead of now being looked at as a commodity is just a lot of this will come to light with a big because like  were service organizations  that we like it's why won't even go talk to like in house design team conferences because like I want to hear people whine about like over service or in the now what you're not but I think that's the thing is if it's about creativity then of my team is now in power to be leaders right because we've gone from being a commodity to being kind of the surepos we're gonna teach any group how to be creative and I think that shift is huge but then also because of the fact that now my team is become a critical assets you would have better ideas you want to do better things like that you need to create a team involved with it because that's again that's there's the perception from if the delivery is just design then I'm viewed as a commodity why do I need to be a part of a a brainstorm if my product is creativity we absolutely have to be a part of that brainstorm and people  one is to be there so yeah I think that's that shift in kind of what's the liberal how do you position at what's your products to your to get you to that I want to talk a little bit about how you lead people  but I want to start with  do you feel a sense of responsibility over your people's happiness people that report to you  it's a tough question I I think yes and now I think I I feel responsible for it in the moments when I let them down  because I again I think you know if I'm the one that's leading the way if I'm setting the tone if I'm the one that that's kind of the mapping that out yeah the moments when I stumble the moments when I let them down I had one of these moments yesterday where I completely west on something and the team is to be a recognition a shot of it crushes me right because I know what effects them they didn't they weren't lifted up the way that they should that being said  I I can't disclose all of it back to like do you know your creative process do you know how to have an idea the other question often as great as in an interview which I think throws all of them for complete loop is do you know how to be happy  again a lot of stairs because I think that most people and especially critters because I think by our very nature we look at things and figure out how do we question how do we feel the connect the dots differently like how do we figure out what's wrong with it it's a hard switch to turn off it's hard to kind of say okay I'm not gonna be that way anymore because creative doesn't have an off switch I'd I don't like you know go home and I know okay not not I don't see things that way anymore  that's the hard part is because you know do you actually know how to have a do you know what you need for a couple reasons I think one is because the concept of what you're gonna need to be happy changes over the ark your career by  just the fundamental nature of the fact that what brings you into any industry where you create designer chef welder whatever like the longer you do it the inherently the further you get away from doing it I started twelve years old as a designer I have to fight now to be the guy they can't leave the find the time to walk into a like a room and sketch on a white board to do on my iPad or because just responsibilities are different  because now I have other people who do that I have to give them the space to be able to do that so like my concept of happiness being that kid a twelve to mount scenes multiple times but the reason why I think that's important the reason why I ask about it is because I think that too many designers look to leadership and say you're responsible for my process you're responsible for keeping me happy I I'd take issue with that because I think if you don't know where your career is going if you don't know what you need to be happy there I can't be the one that's going to give it to you it's an unrealistic expectation to put on me right because the hardest person for me to coach whenever I sit down I see where do you want to where you wanna go on your career what you need to be happy I don't know you need to tell me right I I'm I'm not you I can guess but I'm probably gonna get it wrong more than to get it right which means you're gonna get frustrated you're gonna leave before we can figure that out also this because I want people who at least can question that and can start to be on the road to that because those are the people that want to improve I don't wanna hire people that are destined to stay in the same spot I'm hiring them for I want them to have a vision and drive in growing but I think that's the part of it but I think the other part of why I ask is because I think having ideas has an emotional component to it but I think most people do not talk about because there's just there's a base human psychology that whenever you're happier more creative  but if you  and it's  again I'll turn to sports psychology if you talk about like a baseball header if they're really in the zone hitting that baseball is like a basketball whenever they're really struggling they're in a bad head spaces like in a grain of rice I don't think it was much different so people don't know what they need to be happy and they put themselves in a bad head space their creativity drops the the the quality of their ideas drop and you know then it's a lot of time to go in and figure out how I kind of drag them back out of that and be able to do that and again I think it's just because it's just it's a hard space to go into  yeah because again if it starts to bring in you know things from their personal lives like there there's a lot of other stuff they can go into that but also just for the fact that I I I truly believe that I think that the best rate as I know also realize the fact that you don't get everything you need to be happy creatively just from your job are great I would like for me that stayed best job best moment seventy eight eighty percent  I think it's why do the podcasts why speakers why right like there's a certain part of like I just I need a different gear it's honestly it's why I cook every night because it just you know I'm working at a two hundred year old bank at that scale I would like to start and finish something and make somebody happy in the span of an hour and a half  in in so again I think you like but I recognize that in me that you know that that simple act of completing something creative does a huge amount forming  earlier you said that you with on on  the dog on on your team get a recognized for something  how often do you use make sure that your team gets recognized when you speak to the executives when you're when you're directing people above you  how often you put your team in front of them and what do you watch as much as I can because it before a lot of reasons I think one is just for the fact that again for my team to be successful  I cannot have a team that is sitting around just waiting for me to be the one that takes the action for me to be the one with the idea for me to be the one that doesn't like every single person has to be empowered to be part of the solution right because I think that's the trap as if you're kind of like again  culture that's up to leadership in my current it's up to them it's not and so I think you know that my part of it for me is is to put them in in those positions as often as possible I like to promote from within I like because again as we go back to the fact that I am not the one that had the idea alone I didn't do the work alone it's fascism boring for me to stand up there and say you know okay yes on the one you sure they're the meetings where they just want certain people of a certain title to be in there and yes I want to present but no I mean most of the time whatever they're dealing with my peers you know the the whatever it is the designer that's for two years down for me that's the one that's presenting to the person who's my peer because it's just you have to have that dialogue because again there has to be that trust and so the and also just because of the base fact that if they have an idea and if I have a question I want them to be able to ask it not that there's a greater director has a group project  asked me who then goes Astor pier that telephones all the way back down like we we need to be able to have that kind of flow to things so that gives them a self as a self pride aspect the sense of responsibility over the work allows them to grow okay notation and ownership any because I think that's the part is like you know for the last ten years I've come to companies and said okay look we need to turn teams around  that's the part of it is like the moment when it happens is when that team starts to believe whatever they go from this from stopping a commodity to being the critical asset whenever they believe but a lot of that has to be you have to walk your talk you have to put him in that spot they have to see change because  many organizations had too many other people who walked in and said the right thing and couldn't deliver

 and  I I was just sitting here is blown away but I I'm really curious how critical you think communication skills is or are too it is  yeah I know I think  you know me free is interesting thing well I guess that I I grew up in an ad agency I grew up you know learning typography on a seven hour pound letter press my parents basement and I think you know when you start working agency I think one of the things I started to realize was that even if I was a really good designers only gonna take me so far that at a certain point that the better job this were really dependent on your ability to present ideas to sell ideas to communicate with people to lead people in the towns that I had was it honestly all the way up until probably even I left college I couldn't speak in front of more than four people without being  a fight I mean I just I couldn't do it and it was one of those things where I think you'll from my current kind of step back and look at myself and said okay that can't continue and so I started to do little things like I would just be on my senior SRT of tourism and to cut my college just to be able to start to get in front of people here on how to do routine how do you make them laugh how do you do stuff like that  but you know the way that I use them with things I got incredibly cerebral with that  I started to go out and talk to like sports agents and venture capitalists I started to study with like poker players who can start to look at physical tells to be able to study things like that I started talking like police officers and  interrogators from seal team six the so like I mean you know when you see these people I don't know I do because part of it was like okay I can start to communicate and I start to get better at it  because I'm six foot four I can whisper in a hurricane like I just I don't have the projection problem that some people have but then I started to do more new business well the thing whenever you start to do new businesses I'm now pitching I'm selling to a cold room after walking and realize that the loud mouth guy in the front isn't the decision makers the quiet guy in the back and that he's the one I really need to sell to right to read that room in an instant figure out how to why adapt what it is that I'm saying so I think a lot of Israel was just wanting to start to study this the start to study how to why communicate better how to more effectively like I want talk comedians you what but I've started talking to all these people I took like mine classes at all kinds of crazy stuff because it for me was just like look at it it's not an option for me to be able to do this but I think that I then started to realize that it wasn't the knowledge was power it was that sharing was power and so that if I start to be able to share in my team and my company it because it also started to then realize that  cable companies want people they want to hire people that other people have heard of they want that like Gee whiz factor so for me to be able to do that I need to build my brand and so then I need to start doing public speaking and so now it's like they have been talking for like ten thousand or more people in so if it's a long way from a kid in college you can speak in front of but I think that was the part of it was you know my ability to deliver feedback  X. quickly so saintly my ability to to sell to really pitch to sway hearts and minds of my own team to my clients that's just like the bedrock of of what it is and it's to the point where they actually teach about a three hour class on presentation skills to all of my team and we practice it regularly because I think most creative have no idea how to do it and I think most of them present which is a massive massive mistake you're not presenting yourself like it's a very different mindset as a very different way of approaching what you're doing like if you have an excel spreadsheet you present it creative is subjective you sell it what does that three hour class look like like when you're teaching them the three a class it is it is a whole range of things I think a lot of it is is one is understanding just like your creative process just like your leadership process your presentation style is unique to you what is going to make each of you nervous what's gonna make each of you confident is gonna be different for me like I'm the guy who I need to sacrifice accuracy for storytelling I I said if I read off a script I saw the public access commercial I'm horrible like so it you know I realize that you know very bare slides few things pay attention to me listen when I have to say give me the ability that we've ever couple bullet points but I can riff on that so I can tell an engaging story and that my flow the way that I speak the cadence of my voice is has a much more conviction to it then again if I'm reading something so there's a lot of that sort of stuff  just getting to understand who you are of kind of looking at what are just like the base personas around you know are you an educator are you somebody who's an entertainer you somebody's gonna do can be inspirational as you guys you present you generally start with one of those but as you get better how do you combine the three of them together to then just the basics of how do you actually  give a presentation like how do you how do you use bills how do I tell a story and literally go back and use just like the classical Greek mythology arc of you know we started a problem we went away we didn't want to do it like that hero's journey use that map that back to a presentation again to bring the Klein along to bring them into that all kinds of crazy stuff about even again when you talk about you know the guys from seal team six are from the police officers up had even manipulate physical space because there's a base human psychology that says if I'm inside of four feet from you I'm inside a personal space so if I was standing next to a close you start to feel uncomfortable if I'm beyond twelve feet from you I'm getting what's gonna call disconnected space which means were far enough apart that you feel like you can tune out without any consequence so fun to be in a board room that was as a twenty four foot long tables stand in the middle but it also means that I somebody that's been a problem in a meeting go stand next to them to use that physical proximity to control them tons of like these nuances of how to get them to just understand the base mechanics of just how do you control room how do you tell a story about how do you do it your way  I'm sure any designer and want to sit in this three hour class but we don't have the time and no one no one can access it right  but what why would I mean what I will I will I will  going to say I did during their there three episodes of my podcast or go over this in great detail but for here today I think the thing is is how do you start to develop just like with your creative process we talk about self awareness your presentation styles exactly the same how do you start to recognize what did I do in a presentation went well what did I do and it didn't go well and the biggest way to do that is to record yourself because the thing that I was equated to is like for me  he I hear my voice on my podcaster here on the voice mail and I think for as long as I've been alive I've heard my voice in my head twenty four hours a day for every day I've been alive I can not sound like that much of the tool  but see that's the problem is the way rattles around my head and comes out is very different public speaking or just presenting isn't that different because the problem is that whenever I'm speaking out my brain is queuing up the next day I'm gonna say it sends it out of my mouth my mouth is talking in my brain is on the next sentence so this is where a lot of nervous ticks command this is where a lot of different things happened where the ohms this so that  that does little text were people who aren't comfortable with silence start to develop that but that is also just the inherent problem of that happens because since my brain my mouth her to different places I'm not actually aware of how well I'm doing whatever I talk so what I make people do is to go through do a dry run of the presentation everybody has an I phone propped up somewhere have a boyfriend girlfriend goldfish dog hold it whatever it is recorded due to presentation stop and say how do I think I did Matt axle that I was great the flow was great I was funny it was awesome go back and watch it it's gonna be hearing your voice on that podcast from that voice mail they're gonna be text that you didn't know you had there's gonna be the cadence really wasn't that smooth you're not gonna be quite as eloquent because again I'm glossing over in my head because it sounds great and feels great in my head weight comes out of my mouth to be totally different  you have I think a lot of people have had the experience of working agency side and client side yeah  this is something we actually explore with Scott Belsky as well but I'd like to ask you what are some of the differences between  freelancers  agency designers client side designers where they stand in contrast with each other then what can we learn from each other well yeah I know and I think I mean what we'll start with kind of agents and clients that is I think those are kind of the the the easiest to kind of against each other at the agency I think you know the thing that you learn is that creative is the heart of the house you know that they can that is the engine that drives that machine client side that's not the case we where I went to a star would you go to city where about putting heads in beds were about twenty dollars in bank accounts right like that and that's just the base part of what it is that we do so just the relationship to the business is very different but I think that you know that on the agency side you know that the challenge there is the fact that no matter what you do your disconnected from the actual business so I think with that you can learn on that side is the fact that treat it like you're actually part of that company invest in it invest in learning that business in in in generally understanding and not understanding it from like or stand the other side of the wall but just bend the times you can have the ideas and insights to general understand what that is but at the same time leverage the external perspective because of the fact that you've come in from the outside it does give you difference you want it I think you can be overly blinded by that because you're like all were new work some stuff you're right that that is an inside the room thought about some stuff we did think about it and we it's a bad idea I think on the client side it very much becomes about how do I preserve that agency spirits because the problems on the client side is the fact that whatever minute agency I'm working on an account there is an inherent threat that if I screwed up and getting fired it keeps the knife sharpened creates a hunger and a drive and just I did a willingness to get stuff done whenever you're on the client side you don't have that I personally maybe  I got fired but it's just it's a very different lesion since I think the the possibility for complacency is much much higher in so how do I keep that agency mentality but basically becoming internally to see with a client who just can't fire me but I think you know both sides have the the pros and cons go do that because whenever I'm on the client side I I don't have that you know several degrees of separation I'm on the inside I should be able to leverage that and I should be able to win every date of the week and twice on Sunday because I'm that much closer to it  I think you know me so there there's a push and pull between that for for craziness just understanding how do we do that freelancers then I think you know it it it occupies interesting space because I I always look at it  some people are freelancers because they should be some people are freelancers because of circumstance I think that they should be either because they are really good at just being the independent contractor the person who comes in with a very specific skill set the command there's something they can execute incredibly well and they can come in and and you value them for that and you bring them in and and you do that and then you kind of move on I think with the other one though is you know a lot of times it's a freelancer who somebody who either doesn't understand the process does not stand a creativity there is something that prevents them from messing with the team and so instead of I mean quite honestly turning and kind of facing what that is it's easier to just kind of keep bouncing around we can actually do so I see what you're saying but if you're a freelancer if you still owe mesh well with the team can actually do your job can you actually do the work of a designer well I I I think I think it's a big challenge right I think it depends on the discount on the size of the client because I think if it's if it's a big team that that does value the week and you're going to struggle and I and again I think that's why you see some people who go off in the  they do their own thing they they decide they want to work with small clients there's nothing wrong with that but it's just at scale big agencies big companies things like that when you need to be a part of it the demon the rock star is like the thing that I don't need right because I can't have somebody who thinks that they're above are better than the team  personally because I think if you does all the organization the right way and that there is that we're actually trying to break ideas they will reject the the rock star who doesn't want to externalize their process who doesn't want to so they already like the organism all kind of spit it out  and and and I think that there's a challenge for that but you know I think that's just  creativity is a team sport letters and it's hard to get around that I think is the same way it's it's a blue collar profession it's a team sport and you need other people to get better and it doesn't mean you can't do it on your own but I think but there is there's a shelf life to it and aposs certain point where you know I've seen too many people who go that road who are than five or ten years down the road really pissed off and frustrated about why is why am I not advancing past this position this role this skill set this whatever it is and that's the thing is because past a certain point it's about the we  you are the head of design at Citi bank Citibank is a really really old institution Ryan  I'm really curious what were some of the conversations you had with executives when you're deciding to actually come into this company yeah so disturbed just because I'm I'm the head of design for the global consumer bank  so obviously if you see the city branch or something like that that falls to me and I think I mean it was it was a fascinating conversation but the one thing that I I I have to say is that I do think there are a lot of industries just get a bad rap I think you you some of them you know banking had its challenges so if it's not  that's not understandable but I think is is you look at the role the design plays in a lot of organizations today me like some of point out to me the other day like Microsoft doesn't have a had a design so I think that it's just you know it it's more than just banking that has a challenge but I think you know the the thing that I look for it was the thing that I look for and agencies ad companies was a star rises city or something like that it was getting back to what I said before about leadership I need leadership that's willing to trust I need will leadership is willing to take a rest I need leadership quite bluntly it's going to put their money where their mouth is because I think the one thing that I've learned in pride the biggest reason why I left the agency what was I got too tired of working for too many clients who again were all about innovation rolled up change in ads on all that stuff right up until the moment where it meant that I was gonna ask them to do something different  and then all of a sudden they lost the force of that conviction of that sentence and things like that but I think that's the thing for me is like where are the leaders who are willing to back that up and I think whatever I went into city and I have that discussion I'll be honest I I didn't I didn't enter the job market I was talking to agencies and in house companies and consults his everything else I I banks wasn't at the top of that list but I think that was an incredibly arrogant and naive perspective on my part because at the end of the day whenever you go in and they say looking over two hundred four year old institution and we feel like design is gonna be one of the big difference here is for us going forward and that there is a massive appetite for it but we need somebody who can help solve and deliver it the opportunity to affect the way that people relate with our money but you're talking about yeah she wanted to put a dent in the universe government health care banking apple Facebook alike in there is there a few of those you can do it west but I think that  for me that that was the thing was as I sat down and thought about as I thought about the opportunity to come in and be able to do that and to have the executive support behind that because the other part that I learned is if you wanna come in changing organization one it's not quick  it takes time and it takes patience both of which are usually starts supply but I think that it's one of those things though that I need people who will stick with me on that but we're going to back me on that who are gonna you know be able to to really do that because just organizationally what I'm kind of what I find happens is you you come in you get the buy in from the design team they are desperate for somebody who's gonna come in and to lead them out of being a commodity into being a critical asset you get the buy in from the executives who are then really all about like yes we can see positionally this is what we need the problem is all the tears in the middle it's everybody has built up a little fiefdoms little kingdoms their way of doing things their process there but in color right like the website that's my we've tested at orange is better than blue whatever  but I think that's the problem is B. but by doing it that way and by getting that sort of buying what I know is like okay whenever I get into that middle layer and I need to start affecting change nice well we've done this a long time we study research I've got I've got this like to my boss and they're mostly to their boss interest like their boss like no dude on each of the top Mike what's great because I think that there is by and to do that because you know that the grass roots thing is harder but I think that was that was what drew me to it was I I found a sea on the global consumer bank I found leadership that really wanted to do that that whenever I went and said look these are some of my ideas that I have and I presented some of those to them  that they didn't get scared they didn't  make it smaller this wasn't the point of sale system thing because I think that's the thing I found is like you know what do the words we did at Starwood  it was only possible because we had a CEO who profoundly believe in what we were doing and who trusted us to go do it I mean there are times we work on those projects with apple there were two people the company they knew what we were doing was like I had it is on the ceiling that was yet and he to take a huge amount of heat for why is had a design would disappear for like months at a time but he had face to be able to do that and and the thing was for me like if you have leadership that does that if you want to be that leader if you want to expire to do that man there was no way I was going to go out and be and that sort of a contest to put work out there you know because those things are like the hunger games I wasn't coming in second right because I I was going to actually make sure that you mean what I'd earned the trust to get the opportunity I was not gonna let it down what was your plan of attack for grounding the design team in your first three to six months sitting a lot of it for me is on is incredibly unsexy is it can be as process because I think that really is just a gate way of looking at how do we do things what is our creative process what is the way that we do stuff because I think so many times if you start there and just fix the basics big changes can come in I think so that was my thing was just to go in and spend the first sixty seventy five days of my mouth shut only go in I wanna sit down I just wanna see what it is they're doing and I and I saw an organization that largely had really was more of that commodity they were just going in and somebody would say Hey this is what we want they would go do it and pass it back single kind of design and say Hey tell me what's wrong with it and I just said look this isn't over doing anymore you know we're we're actually gonna go through instead of just presenting one  things were presenting three were made to make a conversation instead of taking what they want as the idea in the beginning we actually gonna say okay look what's actually the problem that we want to solve and I'm in a lot of that to be honest was was a creation of their own making because since they had become a service organization the product people the the the business to clients it's constant will look like they are really kind of showing up with the thinking so we probably need to provide it to them is a very understandable relationship but for us we would go through just change that paradigm and this amazing thing happened the exact same people who were the ones with like all their that creative we spray good agencies suddenly we're the ones it's like wow that that this is the work we've been waiting FOR wow that would this is really smart wow this is really great but I think a lot of it was is going in and looking at how do we do that but I think also for me it is being incredibly almost brutally clear about what the expectations are for that because I think the other thing that you're gonna find is if you want to bring that change it's not easy there are days it is incredibly rough  but what you need to do is you need to have the strength to be stronger than the excuses and I think that when you know whenever we set with that process I sat down with the team and said okay look like this is the way forward this is the things we need to do and honestly guys one of two things is about to happen either about to start making these changes in the team's gonna get to a good place or we're gonna start making excuses  if we start making more excuses that we make change I'm going to start changing things until that stops  because again I I'm not going to lose the people who are bought and I'm not going to lose the people that are the producers and at some point in that moment there are some people who probably don't want to sign up for  that and that's fine  it's it's a bit of a warning shot of like great you you probably need to go ahead and move on because what this team is gonna be on those expectations is gonna be different what's a warning shoppers also permission no absolutely and and that's and that's why I do it is because I think for those who want to rise those who want to buy in the eighties permission to own it to run with it and with my complete blessing for those who just wanna make excuses and sit on the sidelines and be the spectators it has permission to go right  well listen in this next segment we reached out to our community and we asked them to tell us what they want to know most about and we have a few questions for you okay so the first question is how do you explain the role of designed to people at Citi bank  yeah I think  it's a little bit of going back to where we started right I think that it's not just designed the our role is to be  to come in and to be able to help teach organization how to be creative I think it one of the first things the one through the door was partnering with audio and saying okay looking out because for me we need to be using design thinking mainly because there is no greater what I think is also like a Trojan horse for change from the design thinking because if I go out and I just say okay look where to do things differently now so you get to your processing is my process if I say Hey instead  legal compliance business products were you are that that had free okay historically credit has been an apartment no not creative is is is what we all are and I can bring you in on this design thinking process and we're also only a part of it and and we're doing things like that that is incredibly powerful it teaches other people that it's okay to take that risk it teaches them and as we talk about the  four eight it is it is the permission right because the for it takes that one guy to run up the hill yeah go get shot don't get killed get shot but but to do that and then it's like brave are like everybody come streaming over because they know it's safe but it's teaching them that it's okay to do that but it's okay because I just think so many people look at kids yeah are you pain are you spider man are you welding they say yes to everything they're open creed of channels I think the society education so much that trains and out of us but I think you know the it's also the ability to bring them in and because you guys gonna be so you create a little yeah you designer nope okay so let's let's just focus on the creative part then shall we so I think that's really what it's grounding it in and I think it it really is saying okay looking  creativity is gonna be our stock in trade and this was before it empowers the team it puts us in a very different position have a very different conversation and it it makes our product about our thinking and not just about  executions  how is the design team organized a city bank so that the way that the design team is done as it were actually so the the golden serving as basically broken into three parts there is city fintech which is basically a hundred person start up it will start a little bit a little bit over a year ago that's kind of like the the tip of the spear for the change we have the the core part of the business which is the business and it really had existed and this is you know that the apps the websites things like that and then we have innovation labs and those are really looking at where do we want to go how do we throw ideas and concepts out there that we can test and so the design team is the only one that cuts across all three of those in the entire global consumer bank so in but I think was done very purposely because again of real effect change we need to have a common narrative cross that we need to have like the only ones reasons we did was  Donna Tomic design language so that all those experiences can look similar sort of studios can design similarly we have a philosophy in design thinking we have a common visual language in our design language and that between those things we then start to have a framework that we can build against started kind of leverage universally across all the sort of stuff but then it it allows us like I said universally accounts okay like look that this is not a process for the way that we do this to help kind of moved that needle through all these different organizations  next question is  if you're the only designer in a company how do you convince the leadership of that business of the value of design  yeah it's it's interesting I get  I get the question from individual designers I get it from the heads are designed some of the biggest companies in the world  I think a lot of it is and how do you show value  and I think that value can come in a lot of different forms I think you know I was talking to somebody recently after I had done a talking came up with blood in internal design team and I like look what how do I get less dependent on agencies how do I find more value for that and and again I think that's showing it financially the you know look there's been designed has value it has value through the way things convert it has value through yeah I just I a lot of different things like that you have the ability to speak business and I think that us as an organization that's why a lot of times they'll ask me I'll say like look should be you know you you do a lot of work in digital said should a designer learn to code us notice learn business  because if you can't translate that creativity into a form of the business can consume in value it's lost its it just becomes like  they're like you know in the corner wearing a beret doing a watercolor spirit animal like it's just like what so no I  it is it is how do I translate that into value I think the value then comes like I said before about it's not about assets about your vehicle class and is about creativity I I think there's a lot of that stuff but the hard part is if you are the individual designer  it in my experience it tends to be a very kind of binary equation because either you have somebody who is open to it he can have a conversation with you you can move over time and take those little steps or you have somebody that's just opposed to it and the problem is that you can't kind of your grass roots movements it's like okay well either I can do this or I can't but I think it but it is for me the the like I said the the philosophy still applies even a big companies because I think even at Starwood for the great work that we did there was a lot of stuff that was done skunk works like me in a developer nights and weekends to do a proof of concept put in front of the business so we can get a little bit of money like with mobile we got a little bit of money to the mobile website and then we do a little bit more and we did a bad app then we got a lot more money than we did a good app and then the like to start working with apple and that so it started in these very humble kinda like skunk works way it wasn't they just showed up and when we get it we understand it anyone can walk in and say I need a million dollars to put five people on this yeah I know and and again because I like I had to demonstrate consumers would be either had to demonstrate there was value there I did I'm sure there was revenue there that you know that and I did that was gonna be the sort of thing that yes we all we're gonna still have jobs for doing this sort of thing but I think it's just looking out and say okay for my business for this person how do they define value and then how can I search  merchandise that how can I start to go back and point out it performed better how can I start doing AB tests like that was a big one that I used to use it was like great let's do the crappy design let's do the better design and let the numbers prove it out  and I think even at city I guess one thing we do is we test constantly because again if you're to bring design into an organization two hundred years old design is like a year and a half old  very subjective put in front of consumers constantly not subjective  so  we get in here  as the purpose of design continues of all what are some roles and methodologies that you think might emerge over the next five years  you know I think that for me it it really is the hope that there are there are creative heads not designed heads critter has meaning that these are the people they can come in and really can take charge you can lead a company and the way they think their problems all that they can do those sort of things that you know yes there's always going to be the the design the with the ability to execute it but I think because the one thing that I looked out of the one thing over the course of my career that I've seen  the need for companies who can show up with people who have ideas who can change things will not go away  consumers will change technology will change like all that other stuff that surrounds it will change the core need to communicate hasn't changed and and because I just think like you look at all the technology in the world you'll get all the stuff it's no better than that ten  if I have nothing to write if I have nothing to say to draw to communicate in a way that move somebody  Auburn at Penn can be Shannon io shiny fancy animated whatever but that's the thing I think is a is I think that you were getting to the point in the matured in the industry we can start to see past the technology to see that it is about ideas I think it's just can we learn from that can we learn the importance of content of communicating because I I half suspect Gutenberg invented the print press and his best friends on stage going now contents  the king for her we are still having the same discussion but it but that's what I mean is I I think that like I said they're all these opportunities business the fact that there is a head of design at a bank  lose the opportunity I think the fact that you know you started it started twenty eight to that point where the companies like that see the value in design where we see so many of these you know so much town is going to in house teams this because this trend is happening I think it's up to us as an industry can we step up and take advantage of it can we lead can we make it about more than just pretty pictures can we make it about business changing ideas and being the ones they can have help shepherd that change because if you do that  all the doors open but I think it's it's the challenge of us embracing that of understanding that process and an understanding a role in doing that because I think that those are the roles that will change companies those are the ones and again I think that's why so many people want to look to start ups because they were they started with that thinking baked in but it's the bridge of how do I get from big Dan to never had and I think that's where those roles are gonna come most even that's a fantastic place this is great thank you so much thank you so much for having me  he moved to the end graduation thanks for watching the episode I really really hope you liked it if

resolution one word for ten percent off your first purchase  the end thanks for joining us sure thanks for having me so first question what's one thing about the signed it's clear to you that you don't think this is for other people  I think it's becoming clear to me about design  is that  the way you structure your company is equal to or more important than any sort of like process or talent when it comes to the quality of output right so  in which is designed sit within your organization  there is it something that's equal to  technology engineering and product or is it something that sits under those those functions  you know how do you incentivize and reward people you know do you reward based off of the  the amount of work or how quickly it's done or or do you  actually were people based off of some sort of way of measuring the quality flick it's out there it's a live all these other things that aren't usually considered designee things that you don't like learn in design school I think have a tremendous impact on the quality of work that comes out  so yeah I think that's something that's become more clear to me designing your design team design your company designing your company right you know design hearing is ation and like what what what are the principles that your organization works within around how do you allocate resources are you planning center a lot of that stuff that happens before what we would consider to be a part of the normal design process has a tremendous impact on the quality of work that gets done so something that's interesting about you is your maybe the only gas of our twenty five guys to spend as much time on the agency side as the client side or you weren't RGA for a sixty eight year someone that  I'm curious if if  the agency world informs your process in different ways and actually thinking about it  how how do you think the teams are designed in the in the agency world different to what you're experiencing out Instagram sure so yeah I think  when the  best parts about being desires needs he is like the  the variety of work with you to work on you to tackle lots of different design problems in business problems like in a very short period of time  you're working around lots of creative people  where the kind of  the capital is ideas yeah it's not necessary like what the impact of those ideas are necessarily it's just being generative right so you you you you learn a lot there  you learn about the connection between Brandon product in in just the concept of Brandon that like that and what that means  so there's a tremendous amount that I think I've I've benefited from by going deep with with various companies  I can ninety X. at our   and that I've tried to bring some of the good parts of what I've learned from working with those companies or working in a very design centered organization in and try to graph that on to working in like in house as you say but you know but like a technical organization or software organizations what are some of the opportunity cost to starting out your current agency versus client side of star yeah I think you have to take into account the context of time when I started  you know there wasn't a tremendous amount of of design opportunities within software ticket was came up on the east coast to so that there's a little bit of difference there  and I think that the because design practice within suffering musicians is a bit more mature now you can actually have like a full career you know working within  whether it's in the start up world or in larger technical companies  where is like that was a lot more established with an agency world like you can understand like I could start here and then eventually maybe I'll be be to a creative director now  it's kind of kind of equal I think  opportunity because starting on the agency side is that there is definitely a leap between  again being in this environment where the ideas matter verse is actually like execution and delivery matter in the impact of of high quality execution matter anymore  the types of people that you collaborate with our different there's not like usually at product management role for instance in the agency world as in  in in the kind of day talk to software world so  there there are definitely some leads that you have to make to your will make that transition and how you kind of measure  whether this is a good piece of work  is very different between the worlds right like a good piece of work in in need sea world might be what client really liked it or it's sold through work we got business because of it we're as good piece of work here might be something that that's that's sort of  may be smaller but might have tremendous material impact on the business you have to like retool that on that so we do have people that we do hire you know that that's becoming more commented and bring people from the agency world over but everyone doesn't kind of make it over there everyone isn't as compatible with working this way yeah I do agree about the way that for a long time   it that the the the design work on the client side or in the software world wasn't sexy enough and so the the agency world really did turn out to be the the the spring ground for some of the best designers in the world today  how does an agency think about brand differently to how you're thinking about brand out Instagram well I think it's pretty compatible now I think about an Instagram but like a lot of other companies yes it took a while from even think about the concept of  like what does it matter yeah like what you know and I think that  the way he  agencies thrive off of brand because they're they're often in position where they're trying to help a company you know express ideas air communicate something and that means that they have to figure out ways of connecting to culture yeah right you know and and and and not just getting a message across are being useful but also being interesting right so there's there's all these other kind of pieces there  and then I think that  also the what is brand kind of  you know has evolved over time from my Marshall  let's talk about brand is patterns and kind of more thinking about it more in the behavioral  standpoint of thinking about how a he  business behaves in terms or what their release what they say center over time being what brand is about and so it Instagram I think that what I've tried to take his thinking about both brand and what we consider to be product kind of at the same time and so even from team structure standpoint having people are thinking about brand brand identity sit with the people that or you can sometimes be the same person as thinking about how the I should look or how it should feel right so gnashing those things together and constantly having them influence each other I think is healthy  and also just creates  interesting work in and and I think unifies  no matter where whatever kind of  way you're interacting with Instagram that the dream and I think we're there yet sure  all kind of feels the same hall comes it kind of feels like it's coming from the same  small group by the same hand ideally but you know  that's were shooting for so before Instagram you work that  for spring you too nominee join these companies when they were  Lester's armature   I'm curious what kinds of conversations you had a steak was there and how you went about actually bringing to sign to the conversation sure I mean  both distinct environments both  really special companies you know like a great engineering you know cultures etcetera and and also you know seen a lot of success I think to break them apart a little bit I think the four square  when the main kind of contributions there was thinking about  bringing in  everything  for for  the customer you know it's very kind of visionary sort of company  but bring in that the voice of people actually using force grabby day was was it was an opportunity that eyes are so thing doing things like commissioning some of our first research studies like a particular come more ethnographic style research studies  which actually was influenced by some of the work that  that Nike had done internally where they kind of just get inspired by you know the people that use their products write them making the first research hire full time in and allowing that person to to be successful so I think that was one way of changing what design means within the organization and then the other pieces which it less about conversations with stakeholders but more about involving how we did what we did  you're running workshops with the sea and the room working with the team  doing a lot of scope sketching you know and try to make that I'm a part of the process  in order to not just not  take the work away from designer so much is helping people express their ideas visually and use that as an input to the design process   you know I think those people get intimidated when you put a sharp in their hand asking the draw something sometimes right  but I think it also helps get the team on the same page and then  than the designers process after that is a little bit more straight forward because they know what's in everyone's heads right so I feel like   put some of those experiments were helpful and carving out a space for the design team to to do better work  me since I like to tell myself yeah you had a chance at RGA to work on I would say maybe the first truly consumer rise commercialized wearable right the Nike fuel band   were you did you did you have any experience to bring to bear on that project like how how did you know what the design and how to June because I remember I remember using it for the first time I was blown away right top down the way it looks the way it felt the way it works all of it was really cool  but what were while you're working on that project what were some principles that you have to bring to bear to the jury so before we didn't feel man right there was  ninety plus was I had already been there  when I came in we done a redesign of like the web property and then  we actually took ninety plus running and and  and made it a full complete experience using GPS trip in in phones right into that whole Nike running experience was good precursor because you learned about what does it mean  do you know when you contract your data and have like social experiences with that  how does it doesn't change your behavior right what's important about that so it's kind of a good kind of learning ground at taking to the field and world world which is a lot more about we called like the everyday athlete   there's a  out of learning their thinking about how  how this product fits into someone's day and what does it take to motivate people right you know like that having a goal sounds obvious now but having a goal that you're looking at every day matters a lot no making that really visible  having like these behavioral triggers about the experience a lot of RGH contributions were in the U. I have of the mobile app and also thinking about that that longitudinal experience in like one of the principles that we had  mind and serve a mantra was    phone keys wallet fuel band right you know it's like we how do you make something it's like this is another thing you have to take take with you but how do you make sure that you want to write so there's a level of making it fun and interesting yeah and then  you come is like astro was  coming they did all the industrial designed an awesome job there and then when there's lots of opportunities around thinking about how do you make it kind of part of your daily  the rhythm of your daily life right yes thinking about will if you could sink via Bluetooth what sort of things could that unlock right so really there's this whole behavioral change concept that started with some of the earlier ninety plus work never able to broaden you know with feel bands and kind of owning almost the the hunger kind of full stack there  in really thinking about was it take to get one yeah what for this to be a desirable thing because at that point before that is kind of a scarlet letter to where I put on there it's like turn my doctors making where something that says reminder that I'm over weight as opposed to  I mean that you actually want to wear that becomes a conversational piece right now  and that is rewarding yeah how did you approach to be a real change because I mean it's fast they like the the concert and  yet another thing that I have to take with me in the morning and something that is synonymous with something that doctors give me that I don't want so you had two challenges itself making the thing that I really don't like likable and then reminding you to take it every morning   so what was that was this user research was just bringing people in like how did you guys figure that out incidents definitely research down around   different ways of looking at  what it means to be an athlete and how people incorporate  kind of exercise or or you know how to how to make that fun is a part of their their lifestyle so there's certainly work to be done there but there's a lot more kind of inspirational into the process I think a lot of the credit goes to our partners at Nike then and they're very good at thinking about  what makes an experience desirable right you know like and they're very eighteen into making something  connect with culture and in great things that are kind of cool and interesting so they pushed us to kind of invent those things so be it like the reward systems being something you just looked at and you just felt it in your got like  this is fun this is great right  in multiple points during the process they pushed us more to kind of think about how can you make something feel more rewarding  and this is our job to kind of executing figure that out yet suit if you're speaking to thousands of young designers which you are right now by the way  how old would you  how would you tell them to think about weather's starting their career in the agency world I is more appropriate for them versus a in a software company or a client side company sure I think  what one you may be useful bit there is that I think agencies often understood  end of story telling sure really well night in communication so if that's more of what you're interested in as opposed to kind of interaction and building product that's one way to kind of break it down and then I think also figuring out well maybe you don't know what your most passion about when it comes to design and may you need much more of a variety of experiences in the design challenges agency should be able to provide more upright in in a very short amount of time really where is making a commitment to you  either start up or or you know larger suffer company like this  you're going to go deeper right you're gonna get some really great technical skills as well and you're gonna have some impact on hundreds of millions of people right you know which is awesome but you got to have a taste for that you know  and so you  depending on what feeds you think you're at in your kind of design journey yeah I think that's a good way to kind of break now and as the landscape and responsibilities of design continues to evolve  what are some changes that you think will happen in the agency world  yeah I think agencies are narrates our to do this I think they're getting smaller more nimble on there obviously having real technical prowess is like kind of a  ace line for all agencies at this at this at this time I think one good thing is that  you know the importance of being able to tell great stories  no pun intended  is is is is becoming more important it's just a different format right you know it's it's it's not  something at you guaranteed attention from someone for like a thirty second spot necessarily but maybe it's an ongoing you know creation of stuff so becoming more agile having you know less overhead etcetera  be assisting some interesting things where every agency if they have a small specialty is trying to branch into something else and sure everyone's kind of do something else is definitely a  the world in transition and  but I but there's always going to be a role for  who are great storytellers and great communicators  people who are like specialists in certain domains of you know  graphic art communications etcetera that that in house me not to be able support completely  and they'll be room for I think a small boutique shops that are just like you know killers at a certain area  but I think larger agencies will will struggle that do you I'm I'm a little conflicted on this personally but do you think that so I get that on the communication and brand side  the graphic design side agencies tend to be stronger  they'd given the fact that now suffer companies are on this rapid prototyping  mindset universe right  especially you guys at Instagram and Facebook right   I wonder if agencies are actually equipped to be able to bring value to a software to make a product and a not a constant care you seem pockets of that right you know there's a shout out to working code in those guys you know they're they're doing some good work in is is a few different yeah smaller shops that are trying to focus on this  and they're you know incorporating some of the same kind of skill sets and and ways of working  but it's still there pulled in for pieces of it right now and and ends and it's rare that needs the world that you get on the whole thing  expensive for someone to do that and there's lots of reasons why you'd want if it's that important to you as a company that you need to have that in house  but I think that you know those sorts of shops can be used as kind of the their overflow or there was a need fresh  ideas are there with their their ways that tech companies like that can get pulled in for sure  but  they ate even those guys are the in different boutiques that are doing this well are  involving how they how they work rain how they position themselves very different  when you went into force where I need to but focus on maybe four square   when you were sitting down with the founders and talking about the potential of design  what were you telling them what were those conversations  fax explicitly like sat down say like it's all designed right that there is definitely a you know in the process of looking for they knew they wanted someone to come in and and help the design practicing SO it that door was already open  and so for me it was much more about figure out how to get in there and how to make that valuable  than actually kind of like you know come into my design wrote if you you know yeah yeah gotcha cope what was the state of the design team when you join us  Oscar I four square  small group of folks  that had been there for awhile it say it's about you know was actually remember numbers like probably six seven people  and  pretty pretty mobile oriented you know and it's very it's a very mobile first company it always was it's almost nearly mobile means couple with guys  and I think that they were pretty  side load and so they they hadn't yet been like a real formulation of a design team you know they're designers of course they you know worked with each other and collaborated well X. at around but actually feeling  like a you know a team I end in in I think the level of collaboration wasn't as strong as it because it could be yeah and I think that was a big focus for me is like kind of bring that together making them feel like a team  helping them  of all of it how Jenner if they could be how we were exploring problems exit or were there any organizational changes you made to like increase the teams visibility and execution I think the biggest one was probably  that hires researcher that I mentioned you know because I just broadens what design means and what you would come to a design team for I think that was the biggest shift now what is the  what does a strong designer look like to insult after sitting across if you're sitting across the  designer and they and they they wanna they wanna work for you what are you looking for in that meeting   well I think we look for products sense so the product thinking you know before you even get down to pixels like really kind of breaking down given to give a get a problem you know how do you go about and kind of solve that from a lot of plans because that's key to I think having the larger sort of impact is key to going from zero to one on something yeah  to having a sort of conversations that you're gonna have with very bright product managers engineers etcetera so that's one I think  a great sense of craft in in really caring about the details is important but I think having a good balance between I'm solving a problem and then it when I'm solving animus solving extremely well sure I think I'm looking for  some technical chops were heavy prototyping culture so that has to be a an ability to kind of adapt to that world for sure  being to specialize can be  you know or just say Hey I just work in you know sketch all day that's not enough  that I think a  self awareness is a big one which it which kind of gets back to kind of a more of a cultural peace but you know know where you are note know where you're going no where you're weak we're trying to build  because you know if you're joining a team like this eat there we here  my hope is that you're coming to develop right and that you can going come on a journey with us you're looking to actually get better and for that to actually be successful you have to be able to take feedback and and get going to kind of  Justin adapt arms that be another  do you think there are some skills  the designers seem to be overlooking today that might be costing them opportunities like this sure I think it's kind of goes back to the and see the world what were the things that you learn there is you learn how to pitch work yes right you know how to sell work that's like it's really critical to everything and that's certainly under leverage that something that every designer no matter what level  is always trying to get better at it is like to come in and say this is why this idea is you know solves this problem you know and to paint context really quickly and and then to sell through an idea to all different types of stake holders at every level I think that's a huge one  what  can designers who perhaps feel a little bit disempowered in their businesses out what can they do to increase their influence  question  I think that one understanding the customer is something that everyone an organization can do you should everyone doesn't necessarily and whoever gets closest to  the customer is in a better position to kind of shape direction right you know so  kind of comes in the product research side there are other ways of doing that other ways of gathering understanding about  the customer because any business doesn't page and other customers is pretty screwed right and so there's usually some opportunities there I think yeah  so that's one way I think that  from a story telling his perspective you know how you frame up your work in present your work is is tremendously important  to be able even demonstrate that you can think beyond just kind of feeling a feeling I order you know like you don't put yourself in place we just constantly a short order cook sort of thing actually say Hey I got some other things here it's like yes for this but I think the problem we're trying to solve this this so this is what I also did yeah right which is also something happens in in sees allies like you asked for this new thing but you know maybe what she is purple right now and and I think having that productivity and in which is rooted in a deeper understanding of the business problem yeah  can help elevate that as I it's harder for designers in agencies because they tend to lack the business context of the companies of the working poor right so  conversations tend to not come up it's almost always about the look and feel because that's  that's the role agencies play in most in most partnerships anyway   okay so you brought up story telling about four times  it's clearly a theme given here is this my transition yeah I   what makes a good story and and and actually maybe more importantly when we use the word storytelling right some designer Senegalese over and they  send us a all god storytelling again right so what does that mean when you say storytelling are you talking about novella style like storytelling are you talking about  just keeping the attention of someone wait where where where do you what what a story telling it to me I think it every Sir has like an arc right you know there's there's some kind of set up and situation then there's like you know like a crisis right in this kind of some some sort of resolution right so  and so sorry telling least likely presenting design like how you framing of the work how you can figuring your audience value wait what you're about to show them because that's almost like I guess them all and thought about this way was kind of a moment of crisis when you're actually show the work if you just get that right and you just you just show work they're not evaluated the value any web based on what they had for lunch right like so you need to kind of  bring that audience long so they want to come along that journey and then they're they're they're kind of configured I guess to evaluate the work in the way you want them to write and then getting to you in the resolution of course is that you get the sword feedback you wonder you get a decision made except right right so I think being good at that like how you setting things up you know and then how do you actually present the goods and and and you know making sure that the outcome is what you need  so that's usually what I mean by storytelling in the context of designers bringing that into their skills that there are other types of storytelling like actually going back to some that the Nike work where we actually did do storyboarding things like that which are really useful for when you're solving large system problems or anywhere there's multiple kind of actors in the system that you need kind of figure out how to play out or or in that case   there's a host lifecycle like figure out like where it where it is this the service fit into someone's day and having using in just leveraging  the language of like filmmaking I was a really useful tool but most of the story telling when I mean storytelling like in this context it's more about how  work it's get shared isn't it are there any tools and resources or books that you read about story telling that can help people  videos that you watched online mentors  let's see  actually  friend James  Buck house okay  he's got a good medium post about this he's workin DreamWorks and does a great job  like talking talking through story  Scott McCloud's books on on actually on comics right that's a classic text that that  gets reference that kind of what's the key to that you know I mean I I take the story telling piece of that away from that'll be two examples and then the last we created the ink let him look like that's just us essentially just get lost in them yes  I was sad when it was over  you know that I can do it again  I think  yeah Pixar's actually at a company that we we we actually are inspired by in terms of their process right so  yeah  thanks again to square space for supporting the show square space is the all in one platform to get a domain create a website or build an online store they

our friends envision for their support invision is the world's leading product design platform power in the future of digital design to their understanding of the importance of collaboration there use my some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook capital one Netflix in every ND I work with remote teams all the time I found the keeping a healthy dialogue is really important without it building strong work relationships gets a lot harder and that leads to poor collaboration I've also found the prototypes are great way for me to show my full vision for design and this helps cut down a lot of back and forth  invision makes all this really easy you can rapidly prototype  designs and collaborate across every stage of your project taking your ideas from concept to code it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration of core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers developers and writers  teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when the using vision sweet a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision out dot com slash high resolution for three months free  so you joined Instagram about two years ago  and one thing I find is the very best thing about this company's how design is always been an integral part from day one writing  but there's always room for improvement so I'm really curious what you did during your first three months here  what you prioritize and know what's what's your signal to for sure when I came in there is a very small you know talented team designers in the product is I siders by like six people or so but they're all like really super talented hand and then  the co founders of the companies  Mike and Kevin are two people that are you know very craft oriented people right you know where the quality of of of work or close kind of everything in their lives they they tried to date like a lot of intentionality around it and like things to be done well right that that's something they value deeply  so coming in it was less of a challenge to figure out how to make design matter more and just think about okay we got the basics there you know how do you  how do you extend that right  a heavy not mess it up and then to you know how do you go deeper what other opportunities are open as a result  so within the first three months and there was a lot of  there is some areas that had to hire four X. at around there is  we were working on our ads business and things like that so built out hold side of the team that wasn't there  but there was a project that was  listed under something that I would solve news listen before I actually got here which is interesting which was  you know new app icon and right so that was a major undertaking that didn't that started we start talking about at least in that in that first  the first three months and so that was a new peace and that was  missing opportunity again we're talking about this Brandon product piece right so you played it it was on while it wouldn't be a project I'd recommend anyone during the first year  it's it's it's a it it definitely played to some of  my strength  into these blades allow me to take advantage of my experiences working here you know for big brands and and you know and then bring it to Instagram and earlier you spoke about brand and product is I like being really close together was that the state here already or was that something you brought I see I I don't think there was  there is certainly some key brand assets of people he well like the app icon little lesser the cliff but one of the first things we did obviously is going to go through and look at  do not it if things and it was like kind of a little place like it wasn't really like  yeah a good through line through what made Instagram  Brandon identity like kind of together right there there wasn't wasn't stuck together so that was a huge opportunity and you knew that we need to solve that so even as we even the main project was the app icon we always kind of tested against what would this be like you know on a T. shirt or in the world and doing things that we haven't done before right so it's always kind of figure out doesn't have the legs it needs to to solve the problems not just seen front of us now with that ones that we see down the line so  what is your relationship with Kevin Systrom is my bus again of us that we have a really great working relationship as I mentioned you know craft is really front and center for him in his life  and so we've got a really good basis you know for for a good working relationship  and we took a shuttle over from place with that was  I'm curious what is the relationship between Instagram design and face with this I I know you know I share the same it's the same one but yeah so you know  where we saw Instagram is part of his book overall but we we operate as our own on company we have kind of our own skin of sub culture yeah say  but I I collaborate with the other heads of of design are at different parts of face looking so in that function looking at over   what it takes to help design  it within the organization you know looking after  career paths for for designers including opportunities whether it's like learning developing opportunities or how we evaluate folks to make sure that they're they're growing in during their time here regardless of where they're working with in Facebook Inc  we look at how we can help design can  to Facebook can help  design community at large right so what things can you do what our contributions we can make in the world as a result and then also it's a useful I find it is a there's some great colleagues there yeah and and so I find it really useful venue for me to work through some of these large scale problems right there's not  it's not that many companies out there that can operate our scale and not just terms of the internal but the people that we serve in the world and so being able to  have khaleesi can be openly share information with and  take some best practices or just share learning so there's that advantage as well  I want to talk about something a little bit contentious okay so Instagram just launched stories and I will say I love it I think it's great my tie network alliance around so this was a this was a big deal for me   can you take us into the room with you and Kevin where you guys first had the conversation and and and I want to because half the industry or I don't know it's half but a lot of people seem to think that  it's just blatant copying of Snapchat and the other half seem to think that it's a very natural evolution of of where Instagram should have gone would have gone anyway right  so what was that first conversation with Kevin like what you guys right yeah that was definitely a lot more than just Kevin talking about because as you know what you're getting to is   we start with problems right and so the problem that we're trying to solve it this was the overall quality bar that circle felt the pressure to post the best photo right on Instagram which everyone you know feels right and so we we want to loosen that up and we want to make you feel like you could share with everyone as often you want yeah you know  and so that was that that was that not we were trying to crack yeah so we actually didn't start with the stories format anything we actually look at it from a lot of different angles into but really just focus on how do we allow you to feel comfortable sharing whatever you want to share with you and share  we eventually landed on the format because it it did solve a lot of those problems but that's kind of the starting point Laker team you know you can't just like rafters new organ into you you know this this new  to to this  surface and an ecosystem and just expected to work that that almost always fails you have to really get into the details of how you make that  integration happen  and so there's a tremendous amount of work trying to get those details right in order for it to be successful and and the goal was for it to feel like something that always belong to their right in in that and  yet you know if you weren't ready to use it you know you didn't have to  so it was there in a project to let him all right so you guys built it use it internally yeah it's the night before you ship  okay come on tell me like there's there's gotta have been a moment where half the D. was like oh my god what are people going to think you know like well is yet so that's interesting is that  at least for for us that we we did we already launched like the a new app icon things like that we would have done had a lot of that sort of energy right in and so by the time we were we're launching stories we had already kind of  I think made people where that Hey instagrams changing right we're we're making some and I think by the time we got to stories I think that of course we didn't know how to receive but we worked on it enough to know that it was a good product yeah we felt we felt good about putting out there we just got about what happened with the lawn so I think there's a lot of confidence in in at least what we're putting out there adoption you know you just have to wait and see  but we've if we feel great about where land so we spoke specifically about the stories feature but also within the past six to twelve months a lot of strange with Instagram yeah from the Rio Grande color yeah  bringing back like the color within the up and bring in more actresses of the photos that's a lot of innovation in a very short time so I'm just curious looking from the outside like what change like what was the forcing function did you guys feel that you're trailing behind like your **** out I think that  there was a couple things so I think the the company got to a place of maturity where we could do more than one thing at once right so there's that this is a fundamental like team growth peace process growth piece to be able to say okay now we can take on take on more there was a recognition that that we did need to involve like I said you know that the kind of quality piece was like a hindrance to our people phone company creating that's like something fundamental that we knew we needed to evolve and change  think and then making the commitment to change something as fundamental as the app icon gave us the conference is a okay well what else can we push on you know because in this in in the social space especially you have to all right you know I've been  working  the first company work that actually was a start up that did  social networking back in the late nineties right so that's number one role you know like you have to continue to evolve so there's a recognition that doesn't happen and then  I think would allow us to do it well was that we picked the right problems to focus on me to find them really well and from a planning standpoint we made sure that we weren't taking on too much at once which I think I'm blocks a lot of it you know I think sometimes you tie too many things together you can't really execute on anything  well necessarily or things get blocked behind each other is I think we did a pretty good job planning things out and you know and you want to launch stories there's a lot that could follow behind it yeah and we had the momentum to to to keep it going so you spoke a bit about  your process for prioritizing these things that you watch spray  in earlier you mentioned that you had reached a level of maturity to actually work on more than one thing  Instagram is six hundred million users right and you know there there's a sentiment that at big organizations even slower you're right so it's interesting that you contraceptive that because of your size you were able to work and some things at one time so besides your process like what one of the things are you guys doing to get around a lot of the the hoops that many big organizations face when they try to move quickly yes I think  you can never underestimate like kind of your planning improvisation process which again it's not it's one of those things that isn't like  no shiny and and fun but I think that's that those are the things that I'm blocked teams that to say okay during this where she declines like now go run right now  and and I think that it's not to say that that's all it that's as we get bigger that's only can become more and more of a challenge right to do that well but that's why you also need  you know strong kind of curatorial voice at the top saying we're going to invest here when I can do that right now except or to keep the team focus because you know sometimes you can get so big and you have you have you know a big very talented team that can build anything you there's a temptation to build everything sure right and so that's the that's the thing that we're constantly kind of pushing against his to make those decisions around what to focus on so you're  since you've been here you're basically the change agent like the is that what you feel like the product team show the button and I think I think that it's more about the phase that came in I think I can  finding was a timing is right  but and and I think that we are close and we we we we have the  I think that  you're miking cabin or are great you know great team and when your art like kind of so we're gonna coming that is founder let you know they can make those decisions right and they can be like this is where we're going and that and that that helps thing on block a lot of things sometimes if the company doesn't have its founder anymore it's that the way decisions are made a lot more political lot more bureaucratic and that's those things down and so we have that we're lucky that way Facebook's looking that way as well  well listen I I perfectly I'm fine with taking existing paradigms of building up  as long as the person building it continues to evolve it and have it on it right so tell us a little bit about  where or how do you think about where Instagram should go next me don't I'm gonna details if you don't want to but if you want to but if you want to please do no one's watching  I think we were very interested in in helping people express themselves right so yeah I think you start to see a cadence of us of releasing new kind of creative tools and and and and differentiating there we're really interested in not just the sharing peace but we feel like what's most important is that  the connection that gets made yeah I know  you between people right now and and and the the the the fact that if I share something with you didn't have to call the bar but the creates a moment between us or some sort of understanding with us like we're actually  relationships are actually stronger as a result right that's what we're optimizing for so we want to give you a pallet you know to work with to just express what you're feeling any given moment yeah so we're focused on a lot of that and started to see some of that even products like live that are out there to give you that kind of real time  kind of connection  you know is starting to you kind of differentiate from like a standard you know stories product  so yeah we're excited about that world  how do you spell your week  meetings so glad conversations etcetera  so but I do try to structure the week we from the team perspective that we start the because the team in the week as a team even as we grow and so you start off on a Monday with more of a  stand up where seventeen for people understand just a high level what's going on with people focused on if you're new to the team to get to know people  etcetera and Fridays and the other part of the sandwich is like a  a large team credit which is this point is somewhere between Crittenden FY I where people can share work in progress get feedback from people that they don't work with sure day to day  and it's a it's just a good venue for the whole team to kind of get in the room and this seems usually have crits throughout the week in me I spend a lot of my time either with people I support in in doing when once  recruiting and things like that product reviews the whole exciting bunch of staff at the  so we've  we source some questions from our community okay and all our guests are going to answer these five questions okay so going to jump right into this thing all right  so the first question is how do you explain the role of designed to people on Instagram and so I think it is design when it comes to design and die research yeah can help  I nurse opportunities right and help drive wow what it is we we need to to work on yeah and then I think on the the product design side there's a dignified definition of how we're gonna go and solve a given problem right here there's a lot of collaboration with the product team the product management team on building out a strategy and and really getting sharper about how we're defining the problem  but then I think the designers can and can help or really focused on the how and why and how we go about solving the problem  the second question is how is the design team structured and organized Instagram sure so  the designers it's a kind of a general is pull designers they spend a lot of their time working environment like sketch doing layout peace or actually working a prototype  environment like our Oregon used  video and so each designer is is usually dedicated to a particular pillar or or kind of product area you know to be it cleaning tools for people that are on you when you're creating content for Instagram like a stories whatever that what is it with the tools that we offer there and they're kind of dedicated to that right or on our business platform side helping businesses or Instagram as well this whole suite of of of tools that we offer there and they're focused on that so I'm usually there are there's a pool of designers dedicated to each of those areas in this kind of some pieces as well and is designed managers over each one of those areas research is is is similar as well focusing on particular pillars that you can get  no good collaboration good healthy collaboration between product engineering design research content strategy is another piece  and so we we try to build little units that we are the designers that are building this is not one of the communications I just wanna follow one of the designers that are building or designing  and prototyping the poor Instagram experience also doing boomerang and lay out and all the secondary experiences around Instagram or is that a completely different I mean the the the other apps yeah the other I had a lot of those apps into being spun out from the the core team so like a team that may be working on  just tools that are that  impact the main flow of creating content French cancer  movement was example on that was also an example of something we said you know what maybe this is better to do separately  and then find the linkages you know it'd to come off and the main app so it's more the own the domain and on it or the problem space yeah  and they can kind of obsess about that  okay so this next question is  when you're the only designer and a company how do you can  Vince the business of the value of design he leave our  begin today  and then on the right where we're like you know if you're the only designer in the not building it up maybe you should think about that right yeah  but it but in lieu of that because you might need a child   you know it exactly  yeah I I think that you you should be well versed in the business problems right you know like so you can figure out how you can add as the designer because if you're the only designer you not just the designer you are are you right now and so I think that  figuring out opportunities to help the business right and and so don't just come back to look I just lay out you know copying images or you know I just designed you why but like really get in there and and meet with the people that are thinking about the business and then that should allow you to find new opportunities to maybe add value in ways or in certain design into places where folks may not expected to add value for the next question is how can designers measure and present the results of their work people in their business picture an environment like this I think that on the whole measurement pieces just hard wired in you know you've got you know products  part of management in their Exeter so I think that  but it is advantages for designers to get really fall first  you know in understanding and breaking down numbers and not kind of shying away from that right  because you know a lot of the conversations around where products should go next maybe based off of data coming in and show you Billy ask more questions about that  or  really be work in partnership with the analytics folks there and and that's another discipline that plugs into a design into a  to a by product team  and ideals and sometimes it's not just about measuring the output but it's also being inspired by what's in the data to I think that's one of the great things when when  we we do ward  quantitative research or you know be on to try to observe what are people actually doing on the platform in new products can spring and of that right so  I think being well versed in understand the data in being able to ask no good questions and collaborate with people analyzing the data is what's most important so we can end with this one last final question all right go get them crime OB so as the function of design has continued to evolve and will continue to evolve what are some roles and methods that you think might emerge over the next five years roles innocent the five years interesting well I think you know it we we are you know there's some obvious ones these days where you know people are thinking from TV three right thinking about  the leap that meat was made from something that's desktop and web based to to mobile now that seems to be emerging space and you've got  I think that  it's becoming more important if you're designing a service right there's lots of different touch points like where you know it maybe in someone's home isn't the different piece of hardware or you got in your ear or something like that so thinking about all those different touchpoints into like a different skill set you know think about that kind of life cycle  actually think it be interesting to see how designers can help design algorithms right because I think that while it may look at machine learning things as a very  the scientific process I think when you talk to engineers  you know that that there's a there's a bit of art and science to those things right now IT to getting them right and you know I could match maybe it's a five year thing but I can imagine a world where designers are designing algorithms writer  so I think those are a couple areas top of mine well it's a good place to answer all right thank you thank you  he made it to the end graduations thanks for watching the episode I really really hope you liked it if you did

       " \"he was losing my name's Bobby go shop and I'm jade around we're sitting down with twenty five masters of the design industry you've been sitting with us every single week for the past few weeks you've been following us all over the country we did a little road trip from New York right now in Boston or meeting with someone from today who were meeting with  speaking with the founder of U. I. E. and center center this year at school he's gonna talk about you what's designs recent coming of age the role design plays in a business and starting yet another design school give us a second stick around it's going to be worth it right after this partner message  this is Chris me through this important what do you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move with squarespace visit squarespace dot com and enter the code high resolution one word for ten percent off your first purchase  thanks for joining us  thanks for having me awesome what's the one thing about the design that's clear to you that you don't think it's clear to other people    I think it depends who the other people are but  I think the the big thing is is that people think design is about and and process that's about you know producing a thing producing  a service when design is really about solving problems and it's really about   understanding what those problems are and that any solution any artifact any  production is just an attempt  at understanding the problem better  and once you sort of see design as  robin solving it is a  a very different ballgame and you know it's one of those phrases that people use as lip service you know we're here to solve problems but the  what they mean is we're here to produce Aleutians I think what a lot of people don't see is that it's really about you know we're here to really understand why the problem is a problem  and once we understand why the problems problem any number of solutions will get us to a better place  I think design also does a good job using its process to find problems because once you have a problem I understand diving into why that's a problem but there's also the problem of not knowing what the problem is higher yeah so design doesn't understand problems because design is just a notion it's not it's not a thinking thing yeah  people understand problems and people understand problems Best Buy using design practice but not all design practices will get you to understand the problem so you need a set of design practices that really help you understand the problem and so the active designing for a  sophisticated designer is really  understanding how you're going to get to that place  as a high  are you how are you going to start taking apart the problems   that  that you're you're working towards and really get to address a solid understanding of of what it is that  makes the world a better place it you you recently I read your blog and I you recently wrote a very interesting article called why I can't convince executives to invest in U. acts now have you can't convince exactly as the rescue X. there's no hope for the rest of us up I want you to assume for a second that you're sitting you probably done this a thousand times before but let's try on camera this time you're sitting across from executives that are willing to listen and they are objectively paying attention to what you're saying and they want to invest in new X. how would you convince them to  to just push the needle and hit the button and say yes like this is this is something that that you must do all adds easy what problem are we trying to solve  let's say let's let's actually call it a no that's the question I mean that's how I do it all I see  Hey is you just say what problem are we trying to solve right what is it that we need you know the question I often use is let's say that let's say by some wacky chance this thing you want to do that actually works and we make the thing that you want us to make and it's a success in the world how's the world different  right what what is actually the difference in the world because we did this thing  and  often that is like what the first reaction as well because it will be all be richer like okay that's not that's a that's a difference for you that's not a difference for everybody what what is it that actually makes the world better because we've done this thing  and that's  that's a starting point for for having the conversation is to understand what that end goal is and that turns out to be one of the hardest things for people to get to is is to sort of say okay were  we know we have to produce this thing we're gonna produce this new version of our product and it's going to go out and okay great  five years later what's different because we did that how has the world changed because we did that and if we can get to that conversation as to how the world has changed then suddenly we now okay is this the tool to get us there or some other things to us there once we're done with this what's the next step after that what's the next step after that right and now we're on this trajectory to get to that thing five years from now that that this short term project is just a baby step for  and that that's the that's the key pieces to is to is to get to that vision of what what the experience will be like five years from now so it's thinking about the outcome before you make any yeah it's it's it's it's there's an old phrase of of starting with the end in mind right understanding why we're doing what we're doing are we all on the same page you know let's say we're going to produce a new watch thing okay so this is a new watch  why right what is it  that will change five years after we've produced this watch such everybody's got them what are they doing now differently how is that changing their life  and  probably one of the problems that we have with you know the apple watch is no one can answer that question is that right what is different about it if you look at two thousand seven when the iPhone came out and you look at two thousand twelve when everybody had smartphone type products suddenly we have this this vast difference in  what the technology can do and what people are doing in it and it's as not all what we thought that I phone was because member the first iPhone didn't have apps right the first iPhone  couldn't stand  pictures with taxed whether one have be a platform where people are making short films on L.  I didn't have a video capability did you know there are lots of things that I phone could do at that moment five years later it's a bigger deal ten years later it's you know an accepted thing in the universe that the the how did we get to that point what makes a difference in how is your product or service going to be   better  how's it going to to change the world that way and what is it going to do even if what you're making is something that you know just a tool that teachers use in the classroom how is education going to change because you produce the store the classroom you're making something for   sales people to sell better how how is it that the customer sales person relationship changes because you've built this thing and and and those are the questions that you want to get to and so when we're talking about you know how do you convince executives to invest in designing what you really want to do is get them to start talking about how are you changing the world what is it that you're trying to do here and then back into the fact that the only way they're going to get there is through well designed product but that's that's sort of secondary to that the thing why the why is yeah  yes how specific they should be getting in that answer like is this  you know the  you can run the risk of if it's too specific you kind of back yourself into a corner and there is a direction that the business will never go because that is the route that is going to be the  the the the box that you have to check every time you make a product decision right but if you make it too vague then you can do anything and might actually lose product vision focus specificity doesn't back you into a corner   stubbornness backs into your order right not saying  that's better than what we were thinking let's go with that right  that's what you used to avoid backing into a corner specificity actually helps if you can describe that experience in detail people can start to take a part pieces of it they can start to say  in order to accomplish that piece I need to build this infrastructure right and  that that's great  add  thank you for the way to think about a vision is it's basically  flag in the same   it's a giant flag on it post that's in the sand far away so far away that we can't get there tomorrow we can't get there the next week it's gonna take us years to be able to get there but we can see it it's this nice big flags flapping in the wings not only can I see it but you can see it and I probably just went because sunk on your microphone  not only can I see it but you can see it and    Jerry can see it everybody can see it and the  the beauty of this this flag is it's in the sand so if the market changes if the if the customer's changer for competitor comes out with something that that that chefs in the world right we can pick it up and we can put in the sand someplace else and think it's as long as we can each see it there the standing orders are March towards the flag and if we pick it up and move it it's still March towards the flag it just means we have to be a good at communicating Hey the flags moved it's now over here it's not over there but it's still inside I'm still marching towards it and even if we start in different places  working virgin  so when you talk to executives what you really want to figure out is where stuff AG what is the flag where is it and how do we make it is visible as possible and if we can make it is visible as possible we don't have to worry about it moving  we just have to worry about making sure that  everybody's clear  take a baby step towards the flag take a baby step towards the flag just keep doing that over and over again eventually hit the flag if you look at the the last three years and is starting to become a little bit clear the companies are going through a sort of a coming of age in the design function anyway do you think that do you think that businesses need to go through a set of levels forward to to reach you X. maturity  like how can a business pinpoint where they are and you X. majority  at  U. X. maturity is  you X. design maturity is I think a better phrase  is a  it is something that that has to do with understanding  how the design elements  actually play into the success of your products and services right so organization source start at this stage that that we call  the dark ages where they don't even know that  there is a design thing there is a U. acts thing and they're all they're about is just getting the product out the door technically and making sure that you know it does with the business needs it to do so there whatever design  emerges as what design you have right and and every product has a design it's just sometimes it's not an intentional design and so no one's thought about the design it just comes out and of course it's probably not usable it's probably not out yet but in some cases people love it the customer  as well but because they  it does something that nothing else does you know I can I can now yeah the first the first X. ray machine was an incredibly hard to use but it was a great actually machine because you could see things under the skin that you couldn't see otherwise and suddenly you can make diagnoses you can make before so so this was something that you had to be a trained professional to operate in order to to to use it and use it safely but the the user experience of it was horrible right and every every product every service score goes to that stage and companies go through that stage to where they should be out there so focused on just existing with they just get it out there and then  within organizations often what happens is  leader within the organization says you know we could do a little better with the medicine they they they create something with their team that is a better designed things right and the organization gets excited about this in many cases and and in some cases will can try to get them to continue but an organization it's not set up for design usually the weight of the rescue organization pushes back on on that thing and it dies off right and so we call that spot you acts decide where you know if you were if you were to take in a large organization if you were to take some sort of  fMRI like mapping of of this organization you would see good design pop up here and then burned out good design pop up there and bring out it was just you sorties little sparks of design that would show up in the organization but then  the organization brings it out the next stage  is when someone says you know what this design stuff is actually makes sense for us we need to invest in it so suddenly of a executive investing in this and they hired design manager in the design manager bill to design team and that team serves the organization and so that's what we call design is a service of that sort of the next stage in and design is a service you go out and you are  looking at    finding the the different   opportunities that design can improve the product or service and you go in and you do design things and and sure enough the out the team is willing you get them to produce something that's better  and a lot of organizations think that's that's the ultimate right we're going to build this design team and once the design teams in place they'll they'll have their seat at the table and they can they can make design happen everywhere  but that's not the older there's another point which is if you do that really well  one team in two teams and three teams start to realize that they actually need design more permanently than just going to the service organization and hiring their designers right before the release  right the beginning or whatever wherever they tend to insert themselves and that they need a designer that's going to think about multiple releases at a time and they need designers that are always on the project to handle any question that comes up and work side by side with the developers and product managers in the other people on the team so now you're in  this position where  design is now a function of  being indicted on the team so we call that embedded you axes are island and they are they are full time there  and summaries Asians are there and they think all that's the ultimate but it turns out that that it's not what we found is is that their team to go beyond that and the teams that go beyond that  people who  a conventional way have not been referred to as designers product managers developers other people on the team start to make design decisions turns out they've always been making design decisions but now they actually understand the difference between making those design decisions well and making them poor way and they start to actually make better design decisions and they actually can handle me  most of the small design questions that come up they could handle without a official designer getting involved and suddenly you're out what we call in fuse design right where everybody on the team is infused with understanding what design is and that's the ultimate stage as far as we know that's the point where if you had everybody in the organization you know including the accounting department in the legal department if they all understood the difference we good design about design and they understood where design plays out suddenly  arrives the decisions they make you know when when compliance says you have to present these disclosures on the screen to make sure our customers are aware of the regulatory  strange that we work under they can put those up in a way that  hate in order for us to do the job for you here's a little thing you need to know are you cool with that sure check the box okay we're ready to get going right suddenly they can make a good design decision and no longer you must agree to the terms and conditions that we not going to actually show you  right yeah how old I'm curious what  what is the designer or a design team in a company doing to get from the embedded design phase to be infused  how much time you have    what they're doing is  they are  primarily for   I'd actually there educating right the problem initially as a as a literacy problem  most the time what prevents organizations from producing good design is they don't they have key individuals who don't know the difference between good design and poor design so they're just putting stuff out  an eight day as far as I know it's as good as anything else since they don't know what the difference is they can't tell that the thing they produced wasn't good it seems like it is what's the difference and so then you're in this constant battle of saying now that thing you just produced that was crap you have to let us but they can't see the difference so you stay put them side by side this I understand yeah right right yeah so so so now so a lot of what design teams do is design literacy  and design literacy as  here is why this design is a good design and here's why this design isn't a good design and we can start to walk through and break it down into its components of of why it's you know you you you measure design on a scale of frustration to delight so why is this one more frustrating in this one's more delightful right the fact that that this one is more frustrating this one's more delightful is a huge awareness for some people right that they don't realize that you could have these two designs and one is more frustrating than the other and they think the thank you oftentimes because what makes something frustrating because you don't know how to use it but when you've designed it yourself you obviously know how to use it so it's not frustrating to you particularly if you just designed it but never used it so it's definitely there's been no frustration in that process so  that means that you are in this situation where as far as you're concerned there's no frustration there so it can't be a bad design right and they don't realize that that when you put it in front of somebody else they're gonna exhibit frustration and then it's like okay how do I fix that I don't know so so that's a lot of what those folks do at least in the early days is deal with that and then after you have sort of gotten past literacy that have to work on fluency right and fluency is is basically can I predicted Billy produce good design  you think about becoming fluent in the language and that really means can I actually string a bunch of words together in a sentence that sounds like someone who normally speaks that language and  are the same as  German design can I've consistently produce good design that's fluency and that just comes with practice and and the ability to tell the difference we good or bad design so I put something out I tell books that wasn't good when we tried again you know oftentimes we start with recipes here's the formula for producing the S. and then you you do that and I get you to be able to do a small set of things very well you know it's like learning to cook and I can you know once I were in a recipe I can make that thing over and over again I can't make something slightly different format but I can make that thing over and over again as long as I have all the pieces but then you become when you become fluent you can actually start to switch the pieces you can start to say all I can take that from over here and that that becomes mastery right so that so mastery is the last in Chicago literacy fluency mastery and    this what teams are doing is they're working first on literacy and then I'll fluency and once you get everybody to fluent you're in that situation  when you think of a world in which businesses are designed fluent and maybe design masters right just generally in the business world  we have these infused teams and everyone's applying the tools of design this design of that point become commoditized you think  much like say out  but you don't need a telephone operator today right  and and you you don't you don't need a  some of the the type might work process for you because you just have access to the tools and the knowledge of how to do it yourself  but what is what is the world design of this world  yeah I mean I think I think  are   designers  morph into something different than they are today but that's okay we ensure signers today or something way different than they were five years ago or ten years ago so  they are they are very different I think  I think for designers to go away completely we have to solve all of the world's problems so I'm assuming that's going to be awhile yet and so we're probably not going to be without designers for that interval because as long as their problems to solve I've but the thing is is that designers are solving way bigger problems than than they are  then they will be now just like designers today  when I started in the design space I was working with hot lead so I was I was working in newspapers and we were setting newspapers with with these machines that would make wed in real time  and I didn't have to deal with the idea that I actually if I needed an easy and there were no easing the type case I'd have to go car of one  I could use the lad that was out of the machine and I can just put it in and there was a there was a way for me to create a new easy in the type face that I needed  by just loading the right cartridge and so  I I  I didn't have to deal with the problem that designers before me had to deal with right and nobody today has to deal with hot lad right everybody  today they want any they type any in them and the face magically appears they don't go reaching into a tight case they don't go making type their their  their creating   they're creating this in   in real time and it's just happening and so so design is always changing and anyone who sort of worries about design changing out from under them just  has and have the right education to the nature of problems change the role of designers assimilate into whatever the new brave world is that we yeah I mean every time we solve a problem we create a whole bunch  every time we see   learn about a problem we realize that the problem is on multiple levels so we can solve it on one level but it will still exist on a bigger level and so the the  by the way we think about problems all in just changes but but the the the problems will be there   still need to communicate people still miss communicate those are huge problems right how do we make it so that  now take a problem happens every all the time like every day now someone type something into Twitter asking what they think is a reasonable question someone else takes offense at that they reply with something snarky now you've got this Twitter thing happening right how could we could how could we have prevented that  what could what  what way could we prevent that now what is the best way because if those same two people were sitting at the table across from each other that conversation would not have happened that way so why is it that that people who get along miss understand each other and then you know hell breaks loose on the Twitter right how do we how how would we solve that problem and and that's not a problem of Twitter not working that's a problem of people not communicating and people haven't communicated for years that's how wars have started and it's still how wars have started and now we have a president who's going to start a war over Twitter and and all of that is is  bound to happen  and all I can say is sad  but the but the fact is is that that's a problem it's an it's a solvable problem though I have no clue how to solve  so there seems to be a lot of  I love it's confusion or uncertainty just around hiring designers today right  and that may be for a number of reasons and maybe it's just a skill set that wasn't hot people  maybe could be the job descriptions that are just setting up the wrong expectations from day one I'm but I'm curious how you think people in organizations should talk to designers  and make sure that they hire the right ones for their their businesses needs  yes  so if you want to build a great design team you have to hire great designers I mean there's no there's no way around that you can't you can't build a great design team without that so the the problem is is that the way we have    learn how to hire designers  has been this  really poor process and it's just by copying what we see other people do and slightly modifying it think we're somehow improving it as this this evolutionary game of telephone and what we have today is this this mass of the hiring process in most organizations that have no clue how to hire how to even begin to hire people so we've been  we've been doing a lot of work on helping teams  learn a better hiring process and  the process that we've adopted is a process that  is very thoughtful very intentional  it's called performance based hiring it was invented by a dude named a lewd Lou Adler   and lose idea  is that you can you focus on  what you want the person to do very specifically that's really interesting so in most organizations that we go into they have a position called designer and they create a single job description for designer and then every designer they hire they hire to that job description of thing and and or maybe they've they've gone so far as to break it up and I'll have an information architect and a user researcher and the user research will have one job description information architect love a different job description and and they'll they'll just map to those job descriptions and and with the job descriptions are are vague and they're all based on must have three to five years of experience doing information are  whatever whatever it is and of course  someone who has  someone who has ten years of experience could either have this intense ten year experience where you can see their growth or they could have spent ten years at a job and done the exact same thing every year so it's basically one year of experience repeated ten times and there's no growth and what what you want what most hiring managers want is they want someone who has grown because they're gonna need to come into this position and grow when they're in need so what you want to do is you want to look at comparable experiences of what we do is we  work with teams and we focus on okay for gonna hire these people let's talk about what we want them to do so the assignment that I give teams to start with is a process where the first thing you do before you write the job description before you've written a job ad before you do anything is you right as a team you write and agree on a thank you letter and the thank you letter is a note in the future usually one year after the person is hired  to that person now we don't have a person yeah we don't know who they are but we're writing a note to that person thanking them for their first year and in detail spelling out all the amazing things they did over that year thank you so much for the incredible year you have changed our organization the first thing you did was you came in and you sat down and you did an inventory of everything that  we've designed so far you came up with the basics of our  design  system and then you worked with the development team to build out the design system and you got a pilot going with  onboarding team and they built their first tool with the design system you go through a new list out every thing with that person did beat and you get everybody agreement and what happens is teams look at this I go really I didn't figures no work on onboarding why would you want morning and we have this conversation with the team and suddenly we're talking about what will this person do when they get here and as soon as we have agreement on that now we can ask the question what do we need them to already know day one to be able to pull that off and that's what we hire for and then if we're having someone come in a designer designed system do we want someone who's actually designed to design system before or do we want someone who's going to learn how to design a design system either answers okay but we need to answer that before the first interview happens in fact before we write the job bad because the job I need to say we want you to come in and learn how to  the design system or we want you come in and create a design system that is better than all the ones you've created in the past right we want we're gonna create the ads that way and what you end up with is you end up with job ads that are  very specific so specific to what that position about because I'm not gonna hire for designers that are going to design systems are higher one right and so they're very specific to that that someone's going go check my dream job and that everything I've done in my career has been leading up to this job right and they can talk to that it's going to change the way you interview because if you know your hiring someone who has to be able to complete a design system in  first year you're gonna look for the things that they've done in the past that do that and what it does is it shifts the the the key to performance based hiring is that it shifts the arm hiring process from what we call    what we call it  my brain my vocabulary server just crashed  it shifts the hiring process from what we call gladiator voting which is thumbs up thumbs down you know love them Killam right to an evidence based thing it's like  I have evidence that he that this cat it she has created five design systems her first one was a very good and she improved it this way and that you got it better the next time in the fifth one was amazing and she's going to come in here she's excited about our challenges because we can talk to how ours are similar to what she's done before but not quite and she's really excited about that so I can get her excited about the position and the same time I can get excited about her work because I can see this path of her being able to handle the scale of our system because it's larger than anything she's ever done before and that's really key because so often will will get somebody and say well we need you to design system ever known yep okay cool has done a design system but we don't realize that they did one that had five elements in it and we need one that's going to go across seven thousand apps and have a thousand elements in it and they have no idea how to handle that kind of scale yeah right and it isn't until we have those conversations that we do and the thing is that you have all these conversations before the first interview yeah almost always in the teams that I go into who have not  I thought about their interview process if they have these conversations at all it's after they've interviewed the Canada and one person interview the candidate for someone who's gonna create design system and somebody else interview the candid for completely different issue because I didn't know we were working on design system  and  and suddenly we realize we've got completely different people who have the same design title but we're interviewing them completely different way and what I'm saying I think they're perfectly  Mrs I'm to get qualified at all and we and we're now having a conversation with the clock ticking waiting for this offer to go out and this person is like I'm going to get an offer from somebody and you know that's a horrible time to do that  thanks

now is this   here's what else  fresh well here here's what else has been testing as you are one of three amazing guests that were speaking to that are doing something pretty amazing your bill there's  I'm one of three one of three but I I you're building your own design school I am and I want to talk about that its call center center he  two spellings to use to to to spell two different ways center yes L. C. N. T. E. R. C. E. N. T. R. E. that's right   what did you see in the existing design school market  where you saw differ  since he and said this is something that you needed to do because this is no small feat neared you've been doing this for a long time five five years we've been working on this for project for five years right  yes so the the way the project started at   my co founder  Leslie Jensen in men and I  started started the project separately  unbeknownst to each other   I was dealing with the fact that the company is  the companies that we were surveying  word struggling finding design talent  they were we were spending a lot of time helping to bring people in and helping them build their skills up from within but  the time which is was now there's were not enough designers and design was was five years ago starting to get real traction apple had sort of made the case for everybody that if you design things well you'll sell more at a higher price and suddenly everybody wanted to be apple and and and all the sudden  design is now this bigger brighter things so everybody everybody need young get me some of them designers and and we're getting tons of calls and there were there were just not enough and  so  I was at dinner with  one of the people who invented the web   there's really no other way to describe her  Molly whole swag she she was one of the world's first  serious web design  honor she defined what people use on the web and we're having dinner in Chinatown in Boston I remember like it was yesterday and  and I'm saying you know we gotta get design we gotta get schools to produce more designers and she said well you just should Starscream's that was the stupidest idea I'd ever heard and it    in the mean time  it wouldn't leave right that idea just wouldn't leave and I start talking around and sharing it with friends and  they said yeah I know this is exactly right you have to go do this and  my co founders at the same time she was thinking about this from the education perspective she'd been teaching design  at the university of Tennessee and she was getting her  doctorate in education and her dissertation was on how do we create a better design  program that actually serves industry batter and she was working on it from the perspective that schools were not producing people the way that  folks needed and so  a friend of mine said have you talked to Leslie I'd known Leslie for a long time but I didn't know what she'd been doing it at university of Tennessee and  our show all right I know but I I will in and and didn't think much about it in a couple days later Leslie tweets  I've decided to resign from UTC to take on a new project I don't know what my wife is going to be like from this point on but  I'm I'm ready for the new adventure and so I'd I'd sent back at a center DM saying Hey we need to talk  and within hours we were talking about this school idea and she's like yes we need to do  and    so so that's where it started and then the first thing we did because  understanding the problem is the thing I do is I want understand well why aren't schools producing students so firstly is we went and talked to hiring managers and we talked to hundreds of hiring managers and what we ended up talking about was why why why do you look for in people and this is how I found out that the hiring processes were all broken but not only you know how do you hire people and what do you look for but ya have you hired students and what what's what's going on with that how's that work out what's worked well and what's been disappointing and what we found was uniformly hiring managers were disappointed with students to the point where  many of them had given up bringing in students at all day would they want people with a certain amount of experience because  as they were tired of of students who come in without having the skills necessary and so the thing was no one was feeding this information back to the schools and so we we said well there's an opportunity here so we decided yeah it's great the school and what's what's make the students industry ready so that's that's what we're doing is creating students who can on day one be you  for parts of their team and to do that we had to take apart  the way education is done because we operate outside the normal university structure we don't have to be bound by a lot of the constraints that universities are bound by their all these constraints that have to do with accreditation and and structure that that when we were designing our curriculum we were able to say let's put that aside for now we'll come back to it if it turns out it adds value but let's start with this idea of our goal is the end goal which is how to create someone who's industry ready and for that we came up with this two year program that is sixty six percent experience based it sixty six percent of time students are working on projects so in essence you get a year and a half's worth of experience by just going to school and you work on long projects they are  three to five months in length they start with an assignment with what the project is an a and with deployment and post deployment evaluation so students actually ship things which is not done in most designed schools and they  they go through all the processes they go through all the elements so it's not just having to create a great design for this idea I had and I'm going to pass it in yeah  in today's design schools   if you are in a student  your experience  is often   I'm going to   hi I'm gonna create this design I'm gonna handed in  you are going to to as my teacher you're gonna give me an examination maybe  right in the margins one or two little things I could have done better but because I was a student it's pretty much perfect so you're just going to hand it back to me and that's the only do that over and over again inside classes so if I take twenty five classes I'm gonna do that twenty five times get twenty five days get twenty five things back with virtually no comments on them and I'm going to think I'm a pretty awesome designer and then you're going to a workplace and I'm gonna hand something in that's a brilliant idea and the developers you're gonna say yeah there no way we can implement back to bite them and  the the the students like but I this is a work you don't understand you are you how come you don't understand what a work is I know this is a work of all we got names right and  we don't want our students to graduate with that attitude so our students actually have to build the stuff and they have to give them to developers and developers gonna say I can't build that they're going to say  okay tell me what to do and and they're going to learn right and they're going to learn how to be functional  entire program that's built that way so you spoke about getting your students industry ready right  what are the skills that you're committed to teaching them in this class and the school  all of them  what are all   we are   we're focused both on sort of the technical skills so they're gonna learn  how to god  how to create designs  already so we're five months and and  I took I taught the interview axe course and they they suffered through that for a few moments and then  which basically just are introduced with the two years of the program are going to be like  and then  they started with sketching or prototyping so they spent three weeks on sketching prototyping then they spent three weeks on information architecture then they sent three weeks on   user research practices and then three weeks  front end development  and next one is critique and design studio then they're gonna spend three weeks on copying content strategy then they're gonna spend three weeks on  scenarios and storytelling and then three weeks on interaction design and three weeks on visual design and we're going to keep doing that thirty times and so we it's a it's a  it's a combination of of sort of hard design skills so interaction design visual design  copying content and soft skills like critique and presenting and sketching and the idea is that  the students learn a mixture of how to work in a workplace they'll learn their learning how to formulate emails their warning how to reflect on their work they're learning how to work in teams and collaborate  all the things that that actually  a lot of  of  schools don't teach right L.  most schools when they do group projects they have three people work together on the short thing and almost always one person does all the work and the other two so so most of the the beginning of the th of the short group project is two people trying to figure out who's going to be able to get out of the work most and while the third person does everything for the team and  that doesn't happen are in our school we have full time faculty who actually are we paying close attention to the group projects and actually looking at the dynamic and if someone's not doing the work they're paying attention that nursing okay for this next round I want you to write the code and I want you to do the user research because it was the other way around last time so that everybody gets the practice of doing everything  and the way we have we have structured this is is we've made it a what we call a competency based program so instead of giving students a set of tests instead of quizzing them on book knowledge  we have this set of competencies every course has somewhere between five and eight competencies and set of competencies for instance for the user research practices course  some of the competencies were  observing a usability test  planning a usability test moderating usually touch recruiting participants for usability test  synthesizing the results of these ability test so they they  they take that we take the the skills that we break it down into components and then for each competency there's a set of achievements show for example for   landing usability test you had to figure out what the objective of the test was and how many sessions were gonna run and what type of participants you wanted to we don't have a text books to to help them here they're kind of doing this there as like as they go along in real time they're doing this as they go I'm so they're they're  we've broken it down the achievements get broken into four categories we have developing things which are basically you have to go out and read how it's done and then reflect that you understand the way to do this so it's it's just it's just you can describe what you learn by reading or by watching a video or something like that but not having done it  then we have what are called emerging achievements emerging achievements are to take some toy application and and do a little usability test on that here what you know create some sketches and test the sketches whatever it is and that's just to show that you've practiced it and then  we have proficient level and proficient means I've actually done this on a real project to the students are always working on a project as a team that is a real project that they have to deploy and so I go back and I now conduct usability test on that project and I may do it several times and said that  that's the the the proficient level and then we have distinguished level for students who may have come in already having studied user research somewhere having done it before where  they know how to do all this stuff nobody tests out of a class instead you go for distinguished and in distinguished you either teach somebody else so you become a teaching assistant for that class and you help teach somebody else to do it because when you teach something you learn something right so every time you did something you learn new things about it so  teaching is good so you can get distinguish that way or you do things during the course that show that you've gone beyond the course material in a way that we never taught you to do so obviously you must know how to do this better she do it a type of study that is different than that  so   he   those those levels allow us to separate out  good students from grade students they allow us to make sure that students are learning the things that are hiring manager be interested and and when we designed the competencies we designed them in mind where we can actually share them with the hiring managers why things we learned as we were talking in our research for the school when things to learn is that  for the most part  the reaction the hiring managers have  from people who come right out of school is they're surprised at what they don't know they're like this person got an MBA in in designer they got in it and I got a bachelor's in human computer interaction how come they don't know how to do a basic usability test right there just shocked at what they don't know and what we realized after hearing this over and over again was at the schools are very bad  and actually sharing what they teach  and so everybody imagines that they're learning all these important things and then they find out that that's not what's taught in school at all  and so we've decided to make explicit what they weren't right so so the competencies are something we share with the hiring manager so they can see for every course we've taught what the students learn how to do and in fact the students can share what level of achievement where they got it developing emerging profession what level of achievement they got while they were in that class and they can actually talk to the project work they got them that level achievement make and say oh yeah no I conducted usability test I can walk you through my research plan and I can tell you how I did it so that that that ex experience based hiring process  is easy to do with our students because the students come prepared to share the stories and so you can say you basically have a menu it says I need students who have done this done this done is done as that's the position I'm failing and we can give you that and then and then the students will be able to tell you what they actually did to get there so that their two things that your school does really well it sounds like first year teaching them timeless principles and they can bring to any business for around time and the second is your teaching them alert right yes what  tricks for tips and I don't use word tricks now trick what are some things that people listening or watching this  can start doing today to to generate a culture of self learning  yet I don't know if that if that makes sense but that's yeah I mean it's it's it's well so  indeed  are you asking what what can they do to to learn themselves yeah like  what what are some tips you can give for that because I actually don't think it's obvious that learning how to learn is a is a quote learned skill right I yeah I just can't right we we  we go through school thinking that  this school will know how we need to learn they will basically open our skull poor information and close it up and send us on our way and  that that's not how it works and it's stunning to me that we all come out of of these programs having never thought were selectively about how we learn so you know we we have a lot of track it and there are tricks to some extent because they're basically about slowing down and looking at what did you do so for example  one of things that I work with teams to do is what I call journey critiques  add a journey critique is a critique of work but it's not to decide whether the work is ready to go on to the next stage where the work cat has all the things in it that's going to make it a good design it's to talk about it's to critique are how I got to hear right I was given this assignment I understood it to be these things I then went on this journey and now I've produced this this and result  let me tell you about how I got there when we tell show   all the work I did when the show you the sketches the the stuff that didn't quite work the way I wanted let's let's walk through that process and how did I make decisions and what principles emerged from the decisions I was making so that I could in for in the future I can say yeah when I run into this problem again this is how I'm going to deal with that thing and so it's it's this process of sharing that and what I've seen that when teams do that  the act of just putting that presentation together causes you to realize and look back and say wow I learned a ton in this thing in here I can actually list out all the things that I didn't know how to do when I started the project that I now know how to do and just just that active making explicit what I've learned  focuses you on the fact that will sometimes I'm learning more than others  and we've gotten to the point where we build into  so you know at center center we have  what a lot of teams have we have a daily stand up or scrum right this meeting where we all get together and we talk about it has the normal things in it you know what do we do since the last time  we did this one of my planning to do before the next time we do this what are the big obstacles that are my way what's the thing that I'm working on its highest priority right these are common questions but we've added a what we call the fifth question and it's got a name we call at number five  and  the fifth question is  what's the most important thing I learned since the last time we met and how will it change what I'm doing in the future don't tell anyone but that's really to quest  tions  but it turns out that by talking about that and every day having to report on something important that I learned in the last twenty four hours and how it's going to change what I do going forward that focuses me to start thinking about what did I actually word and we've gotten to the point where people who don't participate in the stand up we actually now have a slack channel called daily learning where everybody in the company is responsible for putting this there and in the school each of our students do exactly the same thing they have a stand up that they report their daily learning in and then they put in the slack channel because it turns out that by keeping a log of this stuff when you're reporting your daily learning your your often focused on what you're about to say and not listening always to what others say but when you have them in this channel you go back and read them and go  that's right yeah and that so for reflection exactly and taking those moments for reflection are really critical and we we don't we don't give our time to selves time to do this and when you do when you have a question like that in standup suddenly you you create this culture where learning something every day is one of the most important things we can do that suddenly means  that we've decided that learning here is important and  personally I would love to see a shift away from this stupid idea of you know we need to fail  right I don't care whether we fail I only care whether we learned I know lots of people who have found ways to learn it without the shame of failing and yeah sometimes when you make mistakes you learn from them and that's awesome and you can be honest about that the either  I have to have made a mistake to learn something  and by the way I know what people make a lot of mistakes and never seem to learn from them right so so I let's focus on the learning none of the failing yeah let's learn better just sounds like where someone should start is just having that self awareness to actually ask themselves that question and then exactly so that we need to jump into the communications actually should be super rapid fire okay   we're asking every guest this our community reach out to us and said these are the things that are burning up in their mind in their mind they're mine it's it's got the money in the fire  actually mind burning so the the first question is how do you explain so for someone in a business how do I use the words right  how do you explain the role of designed to people in a business  design is the rendering of intent  so are the role of design is to ask the question what are we intending  and did we get that  so that's that in its simplest form that's what is it you know what are people's roles when they're designers their designers are to a figure out what the intention is and be  render that intention and then figure out if they actually got there and you can break that into lots of different parts of the problem but that's in essence what it is  so  in an organization it's it's it's being  do this and  yeah we talked earlier about this  the idea that that at some point designers go away and designers go away when everyone is able to do that  at which point you L. A. designer is not necessary because everyone is designing everyone's a designer  the second question is around team organization  have you noticed any patterns in how the design teams are actually structured and design mature companies  yes they're all made of people  arms  sort of like Soylent green    now I I think design  design fills a void  right and so in different organizations the void is different in some places they have the technology down but they don't ever think about who they're users are so designs role is mostly about bringing the users and their needs into the organization and other organizations actually are very  they're very confident in the understand who their users are and what they're trying to do but they don't actually know how the technology works so there the design is about getting the technology to do what it needs to do and I I I this this question keeps coming up in there isn't one thing that design does which is why this idea of hiring at designer because they were designer someplace else they can be a designer for us well if we have different voids than they had that person did very different things and may not be able to help us with our  avoid in fact if they come in thinking that we are just like the place they used to be they are probably not going to work at all and so   we have to get to a level of specificity that is way more detail because it it fills a void right if we're talking about rendering intent is it that the intent is wrong is it that the rendering is broken right which one is it it you're gonna need people with different skills depending on what that is and so designers basically fill voids and that's that's    it doesn't sound sexy though I guess on some level that is what sex is  but we don't have to go there the the  the V.  okay this is this  you put whatever all to put whatever label on this you will  the  the key thing is that that design is really about helping the organization understand  what is intentions are and how to render it and and you you fill in where you need to helping you don't fill in where the where the organization seems quite competent should designers measure and present results to people in the business in any specific way like is this   if you're if you're designing your presenting to non designers your body of work not in an interview setting but in your business day today design activities there are there any specific tactics  ways to present your ideas to people that aren't apps  right I mean a lot of   you did you first have to do is figure out what way can people receive the work right right so again this goes back to the literacy fluency master if they don't understand the different good about design your your presentation has to be all about good and bad design right you have to talk about how what you either have an hour had in the past is not good design it to talk about what are the failure to the design of your competition give to talk about what makes your competition good you think about what your existing stuff does well so the you don't break it and then you have to talk about how this thing that your building is going to improve upon that and you may have to break it down and put it into terms that have nothing to do with the actual design itself so you have to speak a completely different language  I I often and and helping folks talk to executives and  one of things that I learned a long time ago is that in essence all executives  are worried about  five things there's only five things executives really care about right increasing revenues decreasing costs increasing the number of new customers who are using this thing  getting much more money from the existing customer base  and that's often retention or  just additional services and  this amorphous thing on a shareholder value which   it's only amorphous because we don't know really how to speak about it but it's actually quite simple it's it's the long term sustainability of the business you know if if if there's a housing crisis how do we get through that  if there's an inn on economic downfall if there's a war you know how how we going to survive when our competitors can't if there's a new technology how we adapt so so   those those five things that's what executives are prime focus on that's what they're trained to focus on school that's what makes some really good at what they do over hundreds of years of running institutions they they've boiled it down those five things so I mean Gee if you're gonna talk about design of the talk about design in terms of those things house are designed an increase revenues how's it gonna decrease costs maybe it's going to reduce support cost maybe it's gonna stop developers from  building features that that nobody ends of using which is waste right how's it going to attract new customers how's it going to get more money out of existing customers how's it going to help us survive in the long term are we creating technical that are we latched into a technology that if it becomes obsolete or the legal  suddenly we can't use it anymore you know    so those that's what design is and so being able to talk in those terms get you way more progress with executives Dan saying this is great design uses of the trust me  and we can end here as the role of design but we're having so we we we really are and like I mean I I wish I could spend like ours were talking about me to  yeah I I am I'm sad   okay so as the as the role design continues to evolve  what are some sorry as the purpose of this I continue so Paul what are some  holes and methods that you think might emerge over the next five years   I have no idea  I mean I I think that  we're going to see  much more emphasis on end to end experience right so this idea that experience isn't just the application or the dialog box that I'm dealing with but is this bigger thing and we have to think about the bigger thing and and we have to think about what it's like when a customer first meets us and what it's like all the way through their lifetime with us and how do we extend that wife time and how do we get more revenue from them over that lifetime and and all the things and I think that that and how do we get them to tell other people to come talk to us  all those things are sort of that but that's not new that's been going on for a long time I  I'm not a futurist people ask me all the time so what's you X. gonna be like in five years I'm like well they're going to be people I can guarantee that part there's probably gonna be some amount of technology I guarantee that beyond that I'm not going to find anything   I'm a historian I asked the question  people came out with a product  what was their intention did it meet that intention now why was the blackberry a popular thing why doesn't anybody have a blackberry anymore  and why did the iPhone do better the blackberry those the question I'm most interested and because that's I think where the real meat of the problems are I don't think we've spent  enough time trying to understand what has happened in the past  I think we spend so much time looking forward and not looking back that we we've this wealth of information on the table that could be so helpful to us because we can understand why a successful products became successful or why failed products inevitably failed we we can suddenly got to this point where we can say wow let's not do what they did let's do with these guys and so  I think that we need   we need to be less forward looking so I actually don't care what the next three to five years have I want to understand how the last thirty years tells a story that we can learn something from that will make the next three to five years better and that's where I'm focused so I've I've I'm clueless  I I I think we will all have    processors imbedded under our skin and   is the alternate and airport  airports will finally be a delightful experience that in both places  thank you you're welcome thank you for for showing up in my office with some by surprise and  taking all right my dad  thanks  Hey you made it

       " \"resolution my name's Bobby Ghosh often I'm Jerry to run do we're sitting down with twenty five masters of the design industry were still in New York we're having a great time were speaking to amazing people and learning how to best designers in the world approach communication deployed design in their companies in this episode we're speaking cap walk ins cap is the VP of design at buzzfeed he's gonna tell us how to apply designed to anything how to build your organization and how to empower those around you this amazing episode is going to start right after this quick message  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  thanks for joining us things around all right so first question what's one thing about the sign that's clear to you that you don't feel as clear other people  I  anything that the easiest with simple Saint maybe I don't think were as important as we think we are I think like  design I I think that's a long time ago when I first art and design I think  a lot of designers are having to a lot of work inside the companies to make design like heard and have like a seat at the table and  to be discipline it wasn't just about like making something look a certain way on but to be part of defining how something worked I think that was when I started his ten years ago I remember listening to all these podcasts from different like designed leaders of the time about like the struggle of that like how do you get people to buy into design  and I I don't think we ever lost that chip that idea like we need this like we need to be special we need to like it means being more than what we are  then eight feel like and in most cases we kind of accomplished but we cannot set out to accomplish right and  I feel like  now where to place her actually to come back towards the other disciplines like tool I bring people with us like bring engineering the spring product with a spring like these other like business with us  into those conversations were almost like we started to push them away you know like push them off the table a little bit and I like I don't know that I feel great about that  we've done a  so how then would you frame what a designer supposed to be doing now  if it's if it's not all the stuff that we've been you know that we've been talking about for the last decade  no I I think it's the same I think I don't think that it's about doing something differently in terms of our job description I think like the job is still to help define how things worked  define how they look into it merry that all together into an experience that makes sense is delightful and impact and for the business insurance   I think  our job actually maybe I think we should add to our job is again like making sure they were giving a voice to everyone else and not a voice through our lands right think like I mean we're gonna probably talk about the term design thinking at some point this conversation which is a remake noted that that I am  and I think is like a is exclusive is like like prohibitive to other teens and other people   and I think it's like how do you like the job you have is to make the areas between design and other disciplines greater like how do we start to like merge them back together  because that's when like the best the best products have ever worked on or when that's been that that's been the truth the everything is just messy and everyone's doing kind of a little bit of everything and understand each other because of that we worked a long time again to get killed empathize with design but like now it's time to come  we have a lot we have we wield a lot of power now in this industry and it's time to maybe like reach back out  other teams the so give us an example right  you mention something interesting that the job of design when applied correctly is to make everything grayer and things are messy and when things are messy better work gets done because of it   I wanted to climb down from the abstract and come into the real world give us an example  well for a small start up actually that is a that's usually just how it is and I think a lot of people like a four five person start up like that was my living in my career was all like very small start ups  I would sit next to an engineer who is building the thing I was designing at almost the same time is signing it like you know you like or we have this much money in this much time so  we should probably run  and so like a lot of what we were doing like I learned to code right because like it would help him to not have to do certain parts of the code rights we can work on the bigger problems and he learned to like quickly make design decisions in this in a similar framework to me and so we were constantly passing back and forth you're sitting right beside each other like showing each other we're working on and like getting feedback in real time   and that was like a really strong collaboration obviously  and then I can a large examples I worked at the before buzzfeed  and that's the way I don't I mean it's been a couple of years I don't really know how works anymore but when I started  everybody in the entire company on the first day deployed the website to production code code like even the even the person at the front desk like would add themselves to the team page someone walking through it like would sit with you like walking through that process and like show you how it works and they gave you this wasn't about design right to give you an appreciation for even if you never gonna do that again like what it takes to push it out I mean at the system where we were deploying dozens of times a day  and it was cheaper to do an easy to do down and that but that was also was really interesting about that is the reason it was so easy because like that was one of the metrics that engineering is with like hand a designer deploy this can anybody to play this because they knew that we would want to and we need to  it's I wanted like deploying code and see all the time and it was pretty awesome and really empowering and that like I can I kind of gray area makes you appreciate what other people go through or like what  the strength of the disciplines are and how to like utilize them  to make the best stuff I think   so I mean that that's human isn't like a design example but you can imagine going both ways for like okay cool that's grades will bring engineers into design reviews you you know want their opinion on the design they care a lot about the designs they are building it and deploying it and measuring it  and so like that collaboration gets really tight because you're working in the same space on the same types of problems and is it and when you use the word Massey is a because the roles aren't so defined that if the structure is rigid and that is more fluid as the problem of all's well everything is like there's a there's a difference between like  specialty ends in like an execution of that specialty  I think like everyone respect each other's domain expertise right like I respect the domain expertise of our data analyst for hate to know way more than I do about how to look at that day they look at all the time   I may ask them all like questions and like challenge assumptions that they're making right but  but at the end of the day like they are the two minutes from my trust them  or engineer right his building something in there telling me like  this is really hard we may have a very long conversation about why it's hard and they're they're easier ways we can do this and I'm gonna disagree   but at the end of the day like their domain expertise is what is why were having a conversation the first place and so  the product designers at sea and it was here to talk about later like are defined I think like people know what their job is  but actually I and I can't speak for the disciplines but at C. like and now here like the job descriptions for product designers include product engineering elements to like kind of force that issue   so designers do write code at sea on they touch code and like they do think about products off it's like a thing we measure like your talent like your you know your professional growth by like do you think about product things in a product you anything about data to think about how things are built  it's a kind of big fat into the world's Christian so how does this gray area kind of organization thing play into the hot topic of design thinking  the the term I hate the most  wool with plans I'm thinking is I think we made it up as a way to  we give it a brand branded it yeah this is a sign of print things so we rented it  I thought about that  that's totally true see brand of this thing and we took ownership of something that everyone does and just like and we're like oh you're doing design thinking in there like nine wait I always do this on an engineer I just I've always it's a creative pursuit of well I work  like I go through an exploratory phase I go through definition phase I go through like a you know a  because report quest which is kind of shaping like refining the thing and I measure the result like I I go through and as I go through design phase  but  we do that organization like every to every bone in every department like in every company ever has that has design thinking and it just they never branded as just how people work  and sometimes  I think the lens of a designer on other disciplines is useful I think like there's something about  and I I don't miss in design thinking when I kind of miss it just like the disciplinary way and like thing from a user's perspective is really   that is really useful for people man out for other people in other departments are like to help highlight a problem are highly why something's important  and I think instilling that is really useful I don't know that we call the design thinking necessarily it's more like thinking about the end user at all in the matter that's an employee that works here if you're an HR or if it's like the you know the other engineers have to look at your pull request or if it's about your team or if it's about that person using your product right I think like  and again a lot of changes a lot of HR departments at all the concerned with is the end user writing about all the time and they just don't have what they've never like branded or described in that way   so the the work environment it sounds like we're describing is a company where design thinking we take out the word design were just thinking that way there is a process about how you discover problems identify solutions execute and measure right  designers are now moving into a messy environment where they are learning the skills of their counterparts and hopefully getting the same the other way around right  and that sounds really interesting to me what I'm curious about now is you know there there's many people who say that the sign can be applied to anything right  but very few who talk about what that actually looks like within a company then  so I'm really curious to hear how you think about that seemingly very abstract concept especially within a company like let's see a plan designed to other disciplines like problems yeah you spoke about HR for example right like caring about the and use the computers but other examples sure   Sunday I'm going to get into this later now but  but I also like I work across a lot of different I'm not I'm not just working in design here   ordering IT teams are like I manage a team which is one team that I work with and then I also do a lot of kind of HR type things for the tech organization at large here about speed  so most recently like we just had our annual review process company wide  but like I was tasked with picking out for tech the tech department like what that process should even look like like one of the questions we should ask  what are the you know what's the rubric we should use Stephen like make give peer feedback liking it should just be an open form should there be some rubric that can help people manage that  let me do that for a while I did like the mid year reviews last year hopefully anyways before that  seven kind in this for a while and   any signs I think it's like kind of like that assessing only doing this over and over and and thinking about it each time like what went well it didn't go well like how do people respond to this to the type of feedback they got like by check by the ball that over time  actually just recently I got like an engineer sent sent me like twenty points of feedback from his team about how this in your view went  which was awesome right and terrifying  the twenty things like this is great but I'm I'm nervous that I did a lot like many of this is that if you read the twentieth thing first just to make sure it's like maybe put the worst at the end right  but  but yeah I mean I think it's like and when and I'm doing I'm doing it from the design perspective of like okay like the end users on the people that have to do this in the people receiving the feedback and how do we create a situation where we have the highest likelihood of people getting great feedback right and people that people will accept and listen to  ands   again this is landing at the real thing is I can actually my product development thinking at all like it's like how do we try something see how it works for the people that impacts and then like iterate on it again  but yeah I think it's like how many departments working just happens to be like how I played it for the sort of things did you guys land on a specific part of a specific process in the in the review  in the media and the annual review that  it was an obvious up front and that now maybe other people can use as well yeah that happens pretty frequently on  so the first one I did was pretty basic it was just like here's a form you can fill out that says like what went well in the last six months and like what could be improved  in the last six months assuming people would use like their career ladder for their particular departments like the rubric yeah that was the very first one yeah got it turned out not to happen  I turned out to be like there's also pretty varied like if you had someone who wrote great feedback they were great feedback is just someone who did that they would do it  and a lot of the reviews for like  cannot kind of shallower like did have enough detail or like one specific in  this was thinking about that problem and the other thing about the other nice thing about working here particulars I can I can  designers are my Guinea pigs can do whatever I want to them and then as we try things sometimes  and so we are I'm all in Terry I hope I mostly Biggs normally that's all they  well it's like they they know the like the the point for them to give me a few talk about it right because then like that's the like  it's an easy way to trusting on impacting two hundred people or thousand people  and so we we rode up product design leadership principles like we like this something I'd seen on Amazon I actually felt was really useful in terms of a rubric for like movies you can see it online there's a leadership principles list that they have use company wide in like this we use for reviews at Amazon take a couple for each person your peer reviewing it for yourself from like   so we tried it we wrote our own principles elected much different companies and like kind of put together we thought represented us on the design team for lead like leadership not design skill and we use that it seemed to like actually result in really strong feedback like because it gave people something they like latch on to to say like okay this is the thing I'm gonna write examples of why this is the thing I'm trying not to conjure up a category like this is like categorical  we tried that it works really well there's like  we should apply this to the tech team like like the seems folks what started happening was the engineering or found out about it about this document and I got pain by the VP of engineering is like he can I can I just like copy this and finding replace design with engineering right now like what you're gonna do that  like make these tech wide right I'm so we're to the leadership team like we adjusted some of the principles to make more sense and like added a couple that like I hadn't thought of right we can enter it on this document  and we used it for the new year's and we used it again for the annual summer probably I mean it's still like it's a living document we need to work on it even more than than it was before but I would say overall the type of feedback we've gotten is better than it's ever been  has been really interesting to see that like like my started here I use design a lot to like try out ideas and then if they worked so like spread them if they were spreadable  our people were  and that's been working really well  we are you you wrote a forget the name of the article that you actually wrote a an article about  the power structure or the or the organizational structure we started the CO orders go down yeah you flip the permit around and and you create a not a power structure but a support structure right  number granted people then go out and read about it but I wanted to talk about it a little bit can you give us the gist of what you were trying to get  what what you were trying to relate with flipping the the power pyramid sure I guess I think the the typical way managers think about the title as it had in the past which is  the opposite of everything I've ever tried to do  I have thought about their job as  as there's power in that job right there's like I and I think it's not crazy it's like I I you still kind of perceived like I look I see on like wow that that person wields power right as like power to change things to like say things and things happen like that does it never really goes away like that's it's not untrue that that's that that's what happens  but    I think it's really useful for managers specifically like leadership in general to think about it upside down like to think about themselves as  like there are times were like I have something I want to happen and I want to like work with people to make it happen and that's what we do  but my pride that's on my primary mode like with a primary job is actually to create a scenario where like  supporting the people that are actually ask that the top doing the work like actually executing on everything because especially as you grow and scale like that band gets whiter than this than the packed in the leadership structure you know I mean like like the  the amount of knowledge is so much bigger yeah in that'll not layer right in that likes level of work  like there is there a lot of times I find myself like saying to a designer like they're showing me some some work in the couple of like directions and we're talking about I'm like look you know this better than I do like I don't actually like I can give you an opinion and like a semi informed opinion but really like this isn't a brand question this isn't like you know I can you know this better than I do so you should just make a call like what do you think is best  I'm going to give us the plans are for people like prepared for that when you check because that's not normal right so when you know it's not it's yeah I mean I think they're asking you because they're like I'm used to you making this call  yeah do they get terrified around  we we just tell them to make the call you to figure it out now I sometimes I was startled sometimes is there like a there's a moment where they they are like they had they know what they think but they haven't said what they think  and they're kind of like   and then they'll tell you what they actually think we still I mean we still even today kind of battle that a little bit it's not because  of the power structure I don't think it's the it's just getting designers feel confident up to make a call for themselves or even even if there wasn't a calling him just like here's my opinion  is just something with   like any credit for setting like people building confidence in their own opinions something we're always going to work on about a lot of time we do find ourselves like from a prism just stop attacks happen this week my first question is and about their lands like well what do you think person who did this like white like why do you think that option three is the best  tell us why let's talk about it  can help just like focus the conversation on to what they actually want to know is your is your ideal work environment than that people around you that works report to you but still work with you obviously that they just make decisions is that like the ideal set up I think so I I read this book called  turn the ship around just I don't remember the name of the person around it but the idea at the core idea that will explain how things and I  in the military like in the navy you the orders come down from the top right like you think of when I turn left like the captain tells you turn this person  last initials this prison term but like really the person here who's steering knows we should turn off the whole time there's waiting right not insane like I can see the iceberg right slot is like yeah yeah right exactly seems bird but let's just like hang on I got away to my gonna get that which I guess will run into it  but if you're talking bout speed anyone move quickly and like especially digital stuff like you think we can change just at that on all the times we can experiment with things can run experiment  see what the results are and make changes based on not on so I think we're in a position to not worry as much about it  it  but what I want ideally is  just to be informed ice one at like I don't like the thing we try to avoid a surprise  for like big things like obviously if it's like a small tweak or something I don't really care I don't know  but if for making it some decision that same semi critical like as long as people are aware like that's that's like two one the court things in the nineteen tries to do is like create awareness all the time with everyone like not just me and not just the design team with every single person on a product on the team  because then it's like it's up to me than to say like Hey hold on yeah right like if I don't say anything we're good to go like you don't you don't hear from me that's a good thing like that's like means like we're we're cool yeah   and if I didn't see it and it goes out that's my fault because you create awareness and I just decided not eye sight until occur I didn't have time and that's not on you as a designer right I need you to move quickly and in the teens to move fast  so I'm thinking through the lens of a designer now who is that a company is listening to this and sees that iceberg within their product right  and they want to act they want to turn left right how do they go about that without coming off as  what's what's the term like going against in the going against the growing insubordinate or allow I'll reckless or like just doing their own thing right well really I mean I think you really need the organization around it to understand that in now  I think there are I mean obviously the way you approach something is always very important if you just make make the call on your leg when you know I made the call didn't tell anyone right like that's a problem   again like how do you broadcast an idea and it is and I gave choice without making it seem totally fine all but inevitable at the same time right like if nothing happens is what we're gonna do like and no one says anything this is the next step right like I'm letting you all know this is what we want to do  and we're planning on doing this in a week they're gonna ship us like this is going to go out like that's the plan and  it's up to anybody to kind of weigh it like you you don't whenever close all I think people think making decisions closing the conversation like that's the feeling that people want to go over I made a call over but it's never over  like you know like there's been times like the day before like someone's going like cable line did you think about this important things that no one thought about in like with stop and like reconsider there's no end on  thinking about time and your work is a fluid  like a flu expect from like a fluid spectrum is like the only is probably the way to communicate with you know about it  without pissing people off too much so in that sense the designer is recognizing the suppose an iceberg has to present the outcomes  jewel outcomes right and maybe someone raises their hand and says that's not in fact an iceberg that's an opportunity or these are two things to consider before you actually there laughter may we should actually there right right and it's also to the that not just the design of a thirteen to to like figure out who are the people who  with no the most yeah right who are like if there is somebody there also times where you broadcast something but you also should have all like directly asked like don somebody for their opinion you know like where is like well this person actually is is a domain expertise thing we're doing like we shouldn't insurer like and it's not just a broadcast we hope they catch like we want them to give  back when we need that from this person because otherwise they would broadcast as we ship and then this person with some expertise comes and tells us that we were like we're totally wrong and here's why in we've just cost the business whatever how much money in like you know it's the whole mess so kind of identifying those people are making sure that you engage them proactively also save you a lot of pain so it's not it's not looking at this process as red tape it's inform decisiveness you want to make sure that you can make decisions make sure your informed when you make them don't be a rebel that's the gist of it right people that look at stake holders as the fighters but not there not it collects all collaboration it's like who are my collaborators like who knows the most right Michael my gonna get the opinion from as a manager do you feel the sense of responsibility that your people's happiness is your problem or is it their problem shifts both of our problems   I think there's only so much that I can do to make someone like happy with the job that they're doing or the team that they're on like there's a little bit of it there's responsibility all over the place right this responsibility to the people that work with those responsibly to the person who's on the team to  frame things for themselves in a way that is healthy  and constructive think like the  like I am here to help maybe re frame things or to point them in a direction or to give them advice on how to think about a problem that they're having there isn't a personal or the product of process or whatever  but like  it's  it should be rare that I am like reaching in to like touch like a team to like like like  this isn't working I'm gonna reach in and do something myself like mean something horribly wrong like that like this is not working   and I think there I mean I can relax my in my career to times were like I wish someone would have done something to really I should  I should have like just owned the way I was feeling and I tried to pay and like figured it out  like tried to work it out without feeling is also a problem  so I do I I do feel responsible to certain degree like I feel like I need to create an environment where people feel like they can be transparent how their feelings we can help them right  but the end of the day like I am like I can't force someone to think a certain way or feel certainly I can only try to create the situation that will I'd like they will be a successful and and that's that's kind of it  so creating an environment where the team feels like they can be transparent  sometimes that coincides with  feeling vulnerable so how can leaders  help make their teens feel protected yeah  thank attacked it might be the wrong way to look at it like it's it's mostly about just like   being able to be vulnerable like the real part of it in the son of man protected from the out come of the normal right because like that's that's also like just not healthy like you need to like this any impact sometimes from decision maker coming out    something I I do a lot as I try to talk to my team  like the main one ones or whatever about the problems I'm having  not only on the non I'm asking for help but like to kind of like admit that like I also have difficulty like there are  or I'm wrong like I try to tell people when I'm wrong like I think that that's something that is really important  like when I first got to buzzfeed we I want to make a lot of changes right like I this team I I didn't set up with processes I didn't think to do within like there are certain parts of things I wanted to start experimenting with and changing and that's hard and scary right for people on a destructive and painful they're like so many things especially with the bad change like here is just so many times right that you get into a situation where someone changes something for the worse and and they just like hold on to it and like your stock as a designer in the slight with this change that really sucks and you can do about it because the person in charge won't recognize it  and so with each of the changes I made I was very careful with the whole team like look we're just gonna try this and it totally blows up in our face and it doesn't work I need you to tell me because we will stop like I don't need I have no ego about the process we have or like the tools were using like I just want to have like something healthy that you all feel productive and we're gonna try some stuff and we change a lot of things based on the feedback like they are very open  I think we've created situational very open about the things that are working in things that aren't working  we we even like so if we're actually about to do our second one of these we have a we did a design off site last year  with a few the designers and they're in the management design management team  to talk about like some pretty hard stuff to talk about what we believe today what are we doing today that we do because we just have always done it and maybe some of you shouldn't do and it was changed on and like we found out that the roles talk that I wrote when I first got here that that actually like ripped off from the one I wrote it at sea was like wasn't working  likely like the designers are super confused and like we have you know I like it when you look at it there like on understand once just be doing my doing a good job or not  and like I think the fact they can say that and they all knew I wrote it right it wasn't all I have no confusion like that I'd done that  but for them to be able to say that to me at entrust I mean we when we wrote the whole thing I mean we spent the next like twelve weeks re writing the whole thing rolling out a draft to the design team asking them for their feedback making sure it was clear and probably an adjusted again right and like me trying to create that situation by admitting the possibility of being wrong and the and the desire to not like like I'm coming right I just want it to be the best it can be a right and so I think that makes that actually creates vulnerability for me which actually lets down  I think like the more vulnerable to us yeah on because they know there's no conflict as a consequence for being vulnerable and they also feel like an author is part of the process right right speaking of authors I mean you you write a lot  like that's like what exactly is like a   she studied creative writing is that right now  how do you use that day today outside of writing on your blog which is I read all the time a lot of  and then I'm very curious if you if you teacher team principals that they can bring in to work every day  through expressing themselves forget writing I mean anyway expressing themselves share  some managers say right all the time as my basically job now  as of I I like every every day start with Mike running up I'm running Google docs ally the like it's like every like all these lines of sketching like I'm like I just need to Google docs like it will actually be very upset like old Lang    some like my my job is communication right like this like the the if you boil the whole thing down like it's not designed myself not design my jobs not like anything's I'm doing it's just like the core of it is just like fi is communication communicating to people and helping them do the same  so do it all the time I write a lot  internally  as for the nineteen concern so  yes I think that's a lease base camp here to document the design process the designers like spike document their whole project in base camp requires a lot of writing  and  what that's like that's something we're working on I I don't know that I I mean I can't claim to have like instilled any principles of communication and then through not I think we work with them along on it  because hard like it's hard to   it's hard but important bill explain complicated concepts succinctly and  something I noticed recently that we do a lot on as designers is like we're working something hard research explained somebody whether it's in writing or like in person we try to explain everything major aggregate credit comprehensive about how complicated this is because we feel like well we understand it took me a long time so I need to like tidal wave you all's information  and I think like  as a writer that's nothing you never do you can never tell you never do that let you try to like cut it down to like what is the essence what you actually need to know what is this person have to know to understand him saying  or even what things now and nothing like they can ask a question about it then I can answer like giving people more of like a  spending less time explaining in more time and like answering  in line for questions I think it's something that like we've been thinking about a lot lately in terms of how we communicate our work on to each other into other departments on  as in like we kind of overlook people information still  it's not just designed to like that's something I was into making a hi how are you doing that with a team is like writing something encourage them to do yeah so  actually started this tech blog which is pretty cool and sweet and kind of challenging seniors liners to write for the blog we had it is like internal or external its external let's things just tech dot buzzfeed dot com maybe  that's probably wrong but   but anyway I think it's like a yes they like me we did have a design blog for awhile we had a few designers writing for it on medium which is medium and like we write about the CSS framework being rolled out its like the designer who worked on it would write the post in and we do I like I would help to pass on it and give them some feedback and market up in Google docs   and and we rolled out its like that was helpful it's not the same now like it's like writing like a post about something is there some similar issue not explaining your work instinct way but like it's a little bit different now trying to like the little P. R. at the same time  the base camp thing we've like we're still working out how to help people with that whether that's like just forcing a framework that simple like that's something that's like a constraints are good you know like treating those constraints to like really just like this is it this is all you should be writing and like over time kind of loose and not as people get comfortable Latin becomes a habit  but I think this is something always working again sitting there and hire more people we're gonna have to you know it's like everybody's different skill sets and work on it all the time so  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work  here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  of course we're inspired by our design program which is over sixty years old  today IBM employs more than one thousand three hundred professional designers and we've certified more than sixty thousand IBM verse in the practices of IBM design thinking  the result  divers teams working more closely than ever with our clients their users and our partners to create modern solutions   provide differentiated human centered outcomes to the world we'd love to share the story more closely with you  and I hope to see you soon at one of our IBM studios worldwide  I would also like to thank our friends envision for their support invision is the world's leading product design platform power in the future of digital design to their understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One Netflix and Airbnb I work with remote teams all the time and I found the keeping a healthy dialogue is really important without it building strong work relationships gets a lot harder and that leads the poor collaboration  I've also found the prototypes are great way for me to show my full vision for design and this helps cut down a lot of back and forth  vision makes all of this really easy you can rapidly prototype  designs and collaborate across every stage of your project taking your ideas from concept to coat it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone and project managers to designers developers and writers  teams that build digital products artist series vantage when the using vision suite of prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision I thought com slash high resolution for three months free  so earlier you spoke about the fact that you also run the I. T. team here grain and you've been here two years two years and how far into the two years that you  I work with IT about a year seven manager them since January I think or December of like the last like twelve thirteen months ago any so the thing that we're most cares about is how do you split your time because as of beef you design that the last thing I thought about was like I. T. right  but it's actually pretty awesome like you spoke about what that relationship looks like so got like what what is it they look like or week look like a cap  it depends a lot of Google docs yeah  yeah it's it's kind of insane with I would say right now there's multiple problems right now  where I'm actually one of my senators is doing a six week like residency off the team on a on an editorial she's making editorial work doing editorial work for six weeks some managing her designers temporarily for liking other couples just gets back please come backs   but   yeah so now right now it's completely insane but in general I mean the nice thing is like both on design and I see like the management the managers on that those teams are pretty strong and so like  and lean on them a lot to kind of bone the teens  which is a manager when I was not when I was just  design manager was like what I actually really wanted to happen I wanted to own the team right and what it's like with me in the design managers like have kind of like the bill to the division forth into the goals and so I think like   I'm a lot more like a connector and I like a guiding voice for them and like I say ten the manager meeting so we have a design and  meeting each week and I team manager meaning each week   we have team why meanings right that I go to solve IT and then like all of design meetings like I go to those and talk to them I have a lot of one on ones  a lot of white ones right now  with all the managers but also some of the designers on that I try to keep in touch with  I obviously I can part of like the tech leadership team so I have those meetings we talk about the whole tech team Hans working  that's kind of how my week looks I wouldn't that wouldn't leader seeing you that they said let's give the design guide this IT stuff  Olympic three that's exactly how that meeting went this is put the design guide charge of IT that's it well it wasn't that far off I am    what happened was we had done a us we do employee engagement service I don't know if like you know a lot approximately this but what happens is you send a survey out the whole company kind of gauging how people are feeling about the company's strategy like the communication within a company like another job thirteen dare managements like how things are going right  and we break that down by department we can kind of get an overview of how like design feels with intact  how tec feels overall and kind of see what the trends are  and so about a year ago we noticed that the  the I. T. team was in a knot was a non like an anomaly was like off like it was very low like the way they were feeling about how things are going on their team  was not great they were feeling very good  and they're kind of missing that like their director kind of moved on from buzzfeed in like they were kind of they were missing that person and  and so  there was I don't remember exactly how it went down but like someone mentioned in leadership meeting that like because I I think it was very clear about that point that I really care about organizational things and care about people and  and I had some success with the design team and kind of like bring like again that was a team that felt pretty broken and like and I a year and was feeling a lot like more stable and strong and healthy  think there's some trust there that that was something I was good at  cared about  and I remember getting a direct message from my boss who runs Dow she runs all of technologies like that oversees all of the department has eleven o'clock at night and she like message me on slack I was even on I wasn't even online like on my phone and like it she said like Hey like  research here about managing IT team was like I didn't never said that  well if someone else said that I should do that that's called inception yeah she's planted that in your in your right  did I say it even now I'm questioning myself like that I do not  and so she and I talked about a lot is I want to talk about it I can only hear the design team right it was still like I had a lot of work to do still  I look like I really care about I mean I knew that the only I teach him how huge or great in an attack as I knew them Anderson a personally I really I like them a lot of care about them as people I wanted them to feel good as it will look like if I can help lay as long as it's temporary I'm totally happy to like work on this for like in Iraq can be hiring somebody right to do this job so like no problem around a few months and now it's been over a year and that's what I want done I  yeah and so  sixty really cool I really it's on  I I I I like design stuff I also really like now it's obvious I really management things and I was really curious to see like is managing and different discipline what were the differences in what similarities and  that's been really interesting to find out like what the what the heck how common it is and then also like the ways that it kind of isn't what what were those things the the differences and similarities  well coming out is a kind of like  every team is the same stuff like at the at the baseline like there's  you know there's like nails hierarchy of needs your isn't the by bases like food shelter every teeny through in shelter there's no there's no other if if you don't do that nothing else on the part and it doesn't get lunch right like we need let me lunch and we should have some yeah we should do something about this hunger problem department  and so  and those things are all the same they're like  communication transparency like the you know  managers who are thinking about the team's happiness right like all these like  all these like you know not knowing if you're doing the job or not that's like the such a weird thing to like everyone needs to know everyone needs to have some sense like I'm doing my job and doing it well you know like they need to be able to like not have to get verified from Sony doing a job she is now on so there are things like you know  roll documentation that didn't exist so like we should do that's what people can read and now these are things opposed to do great at them like skills good    regular one ones with their manager work happening right so like when our doing now the managers are weekly wants with all the people that were fortunately teen goals like kind of like team has your teen collaborate with each other  these are all things like this nineteen needed I teachings engineering needs a turn everyone needs this these things to be good in order to do anything to execute it even the most like basic level right to get just to a foundational level of execution  what's interesting is the difference is  but there are departmental differences I find very interesting in there somewhere but they're also not we're like  design sometimes like gets like to actually a service sometimes right in saying that we hear a lot  but in like part of development particular particular here or somewhere like until it doesn't feel that way like it's like it's very integrated it feels like one team  it doesn't like a service but decision I. T. is a kind of always is like it's a piece of infrastructure I guess the core piece of light company infrastructure in so that I know that feeling of being a service never really goes away but all the pain of being a service remains do you know what I mean I like those challenges like with the design team you're like oh let's get rid of those let's let's try to get out of that right nineteen you can never you can never do that right you have to like like you have to respond when it's like someone's computer dies and their work was on it and it was a really important story were trying to get out right  like  yeah it's like that's like the it never really those challenges stay the same and it's been a really interesting thing to try to manage and understand how to make it the best it can be and make them feel really great about it  at the same time is like not not try to isolate white away from that idea you know on and it's been like that then last this really occurred in the last like three or four months even  seconds of the first night of time trying to like get a martini centric things that I know how to do already I'm are you see given the breadth of management experience you had at buzzfeed and the amount of work you've done with different kinds of people you're sitting across from two people at this table right now us to assume one of us is a direct report and the other one of us is a manager what would you want what what would you want to tell the manager about the direct report that they should know to do a better job and and their manager role  and what would you tell the direct report about the manager to make them do a better job at being a direct report  I think the manager stuff is all in a rehash of what we've said so far about like  being open about your own like channels  that you might be wrong or like you know kind of like  building empathy by being vulnerable yourself reading is like really important and then like listening to the  helping them I think there's a thing or like managers listen a lot but they don't do anything like that feel like  I listened and like that's when you're for it like a therapist and singing well now you know like division courage people saw them because of their also times you need to like actually help somebody and like that's important so try to identify with those are ask if they want your help  like I and everyone along with like two new thing for me right now is there anything I can do to help you   inside you'll see now and sometimes people think about it for awhile and then they'll say like holy and might be nice to whatever  all asked like if I did this would that be helpful right on to doctor port like I think that   director person to take more responsibility for making their manager get this is like a really this Mike this Michael **** up actually but like but I think  a lot of people and this is not the fault of people that are of the the direct reports I think  not necessarily but a lot of I mean my eyes half of my career I didn't know a good management was and I was getting managed and I'm getting is pretty poorly if I think about it like if I go back and think okay  how my doing this and how what I want to stop and like I wasn't happening for me on this because I had no clue like I had never had a good manners I never understood what that I never really pursued that knowledge of what it should be second I remember when I had my first one on one at at sea with Iran and I was like wait what  every week  and I can talk about my problems and you might do something like it was the weirdest feeling it was just like I was like all my god I was like this I spent six years I think do not having any of this like this feeling so ticked all the time and not be able to like talk to anybody about it  it was insane I just in the  and what's really the findings the information is out there like I think mention books are not just for managers I was started reading management books before I became a manager I was still like a direct report   because I just wanted to now like I had gone to a place in my career as a sex so frustrated management laziness no like why it was so bad  so it's hard to read these books and like  like I think I would encourage anybody to read something like managing humans  Michael lop like that's like it's a very easy read it's it tells you  everything a good manager like a again a kind of a baseline in some given the honor of like what a good manager should even do and then you should set your expectations  like they're still times of my manager did I ask for things that I know I need like I need this thing I need this from you like I need this direction from you I need you to tell me  this thing  because it's like I think it's unreasonable to expect every managers and expects a lot of them are first time managers I have like every manager my team as a for is their first time like new than doing for year two but like that's not that long you know hung to take a good design you know like a decade now and so it's the people see managers like I should just be really great at this and it's not it's just as hard to get good at that and so I think having expectations wrecked report it's also a responsibility not let about manager be a bad manager you know to keep pushing on that or to like raise it to their manager right like to keep kind of like trying to get what you need out of them and to realize what that is it's like I don't know that's the big thing I don't think people taking of us for the things you need  so there's something a buzzfeed called the manager Dan yes so I'm really curious what that is  and what are the outcomes that you're trying to produce for your manager's especially considering that you may  a good bit of them the first time yeah  to full disclosure I stole this from that's a two  this is it  are still  and and actually I just got I went down to I went to see if he wants to go to talk to their learning and development team about manager because they've been there for a lot longer than I than we've done it here and I only still like my with my memory of it and like to talk about how they've evolved over time like what their successes been like what the challenges are like and how to structure was really and they were like here's all the stuff like they just like gave it to us awesome  so it when he was stealing  they really she's in the the person I talked to she email me later would like all of these like videos that they use for like onboarding people in the dens and like it was cool is super neat on time I have a text book that she recommended on my desk that I'm I'm reading a text book  facilitation right now  is really cool so I mentored ends are for us our bi weekly there like every two weeks and they are a mix of managers right now across the tech team  that meet together to in like a space that we consider like a account like a cone of silence kind of really people can say what they say anything like the man just talk about hard hard manager things like you you have a design review redesign critique and people can get formal that critique ideally you can give each other feedback you can like turn on a hard the project is an unsigned critique nine managers on how that like many somehow that outlet that they have their manager and that's kind of it and the thing I notice is like if you a lot of bad managers also have bad managers like like that's not uncommon and so asking and hoping that changes it is an income isn't enough either right you're kind of like they're limited in their ability to get you back to a good feedback from people who are successor doing things differently and so   and so we've murder like me you know we have engineering managers product manager people manage product manager managers   design managers I team managers like all we've mixed them into these like four five person groups labeled bands and they like need every couple of weeks they talk about as long structure right now they talk about whatever's like right now I see that the topic is around  anywhere views and like how to think about compensation adjustments right and they're having like hard conversation sometimes means about like why this person and like this is what's happening and I don't know what to do in like but they have peeling advice from there like a group of people may have experienced before  are similar experience or think about something maybe in a different way and that's been really valuable   we talked about so re re re tooling them right now to be better and we're gonna include another department ran start including some editorial managers very soon and and that the person I work with us on Amy and I were like well we should pause the downs for like three or four weeks we can like really focused on retooling this thing we we suggest it to the people down there like now like we are not stop and they were like don't pause this like they were like really like Texas yeah they're really like wait don't do this don't with his super valuable right now and like so we just the right okay keep hi thanks for   but yes that's been really awesome on to a manager please talk to each other and to learn from each other on I'm really said of the editorial and that's going to be like way even more eye opening for everybody about other challenges from that apartment really cool so it sounds like  bus he has a really strong culture of empowerment and just education Ryan  especially around roles so I'm really curious what your stance is or not even stand just how you think about hiring from the outside versus promoting from within  I mean I I mean in terms of management stuff ideally were promoting within like and that's always a deal I think  where is my situation right now where no one is nineteen must remain under the only designers I would talk to them all back and everyone just like I'm good I wanna be it's not gonna be senior designer on the stuff is either like they're all like on that track and they want nothing to do with what we do so no choice like wanna hire manager like if we need a manager kind of host we have to go outside   but ideally like our mean it would be great to be able to cultivate that internally because you it's just like  number one I got at the I was I came into the from the outside as a design angelic came in as a manager    and at the same time two of the designs are promoted to design it with the first three design managers at C. like that ever existed outside of Randy   and those two in the two people can NJ either to design injures and been there for awhile like they've been there for a year to Jay for law a little bit longer  a lot of trust RT builds up like this afternoon with a word they they do their work they knew how they interacted with each other and so what we wound up doing was like I took on no designers when I started and they split the team in half because like that was just like it was so much more effective that way they know how to let go because this person  they knew who they were and so over time I went up like  I will design work for a while building Trussell Hey it's hard to build out minister to hire people for my team in line into the teams I was on and eventually like was managing people but  yeah I mean it's always better that way because they are you know who they are and there's no there's no tears buildup record everything that you mentioned you mentioned that   in the design team right now there are a lot of people who wanted to just take the road route of you mention staff designer senior product designer  which is awesome and I think there's  underlying question there which is  how do you see  the progression of a designer's career because there many companies where for designer they think that in order to move up they have to become a manager yeah right and  but in reality you actually like that if that company yeah but in reality there is another route that so we can take right but it's not really the find an established and some really curious to hear how you think about it and what you're doing here a dusty to actually allow someone to say I don't want to be a manager I want to be something else right yeah I yeah they're like people become managers because they can they have to and they're terrible I don't think that this is a very common tell you take your most talented designer talented engineering you make them a manager and also in all your productivity goes away and people are passed because they're bad and like everything goes wrong simultaneously you know and the managers frustrate because they can't write code in light or do the design work in like yes just all huge mass and it's because you didn't create that structure  so the way it is nineteen is leveled is that the manager and is on track for paralyzed arms they're not they don't stock there like on top of each other if I miss a lot of places are like it's stacked words like Sears liner creative director whatever it's because of this thing  for us it's like you know a product designer seniors understaffed liner principles and  we we aren't we have defined roles because they exist but we just don't know how anybody that's knocking on doors and as we haven't taken the time to make some real but then the staff designer role is the Cleveland to them angeal manager all like that's like design manager with mail for five people part and I'm like that's the same levels stock designer and like a prince was one of the senior manager and so on a thing  and so and actually like the designer levels go up to him trying to remember  I think they go up to the look like to my level like that just the potential like that that that track it's not friendly principle is your level no it keeps going beyond that like there's like principle would be the equivalent of like a cry of  director level gotcha interesting and and is this level like compensation power seven are like a power  influencer like yeah I mean yeah it's it's well it's skill influence on both tracks right   they mainly to find it and pass the stop sign  roles like me is no ones and I right now we have a few senior designers who are working on the staff role and I mean as you go up in any of them either track like things become more broader nebulous and more about leadership and like  identification problems and solutions falling more than it is about the like actual design works a certain point like if your senior designer like you keep getting better as a designer you know over time but it's like pretty good we trust you with almost anything I can give you a project like I know that's not what I'm worried about is like our like are you saying like  we don't have design principles for visual design system I maybe we should do that and that's what we want that level of designer to do that the managers like we're doing now but should be doing you know so senior designer is pretty common at this point what does a was a principal designer  well the staff is is after  senior and I we haven't defined the principal role okay   I mean I would imagine it's more cross departmental like influence where you're working directly with other departments to like identify their needs to like ahead of time or to think deeply understand that department  so someone who works on tools for our business team right on that team like  the poll designer in that role wouldn't know the entire business like every piece of it when would always be in communication with that like with it you know I mean it's like it's more again it's a great everything I think becomes more important some super important my role to know as much about everything is possible right claims will make those like mental connections when they come up is a similar thing I think for designers like as you at understanding of the business and of like the departments that you work with is like just has to get deeper over time   as well as our inputs on the nineteen right at large so so can we reach out to our community and we asked them to tell us what's on their mind and what they want to know about the most we have five questions that we want to go through with you right  so here's here's the first question how do you explain the role of design to people at buzzfeed  I don't is one thing maybe in  I is like I said I can't talk about them I talk about the mess of it I think everybody I'm running to be the doesn't understands that like the core kind of function as a designer like the kind of like  they they work on I've seen where princess person maybe and I've seen lately see artifacts and kind of understand that dot like kind of like code that we make and make some artifacts that go into a process that we work on together something   but I don't feel like I don't know that I ever really feel the need to like have to make them understand like unless again like the engineers understand very deeply without anybody Clinton because they work with there's all time and the designer bring with them based  that is  sorry  and the designers bringing with them based on the role they know they have right and like that kind of thing in the messiness that they bring in terms of writing code so they bring that into the team and so they don't have to really explain it very often  so I don't know I I don't  I don't know I don't know the answer the question I don't have an error on to really do that  which means that it's  sorry whoever asks a question  how is the design team organized a bus we'd  okay so there is  does he have a product on the team that I might help because that's how we're organized so there is a product nineteen it's non centralize like it's distributed into the teams they work with so we also they don't also we don't sit together since nineteen   so the part of a minority is there's a is the group a bunch of groups that work on consumer product it's like the apps the websites  distributed stuff like our instant articles apple news like the let's account lives in a few groups that work on the stuff RCM asks like other editors used to publish on buzzfeed like that all lives with the consumer groups  and then we have a series of tooling teams are internal tooling teams that are at work on  tools for our business unit sales in it the work on work flow tools for older video producers on to use to like published like to make and publish videos and then a learning tools in the works on more like  analytics tools like data analysis tools for content for the people to make stuff here to like I understand how their video did or how they're posted and how to like improve upon it and so designers are engineers and product people in designers are bad it into those areas  and   and working type team so they like working like for five people in a few couple engineers designer product person are working on that thing together  everyone's while like the shuffle obviously depending on need and business strategy and stuff like that but that's basically the organization  like design managers that like  the manager civic groups and his eyes and his group since that's like so that they are also semi accountable for the output now comes from the groups themselves so strong managers managing random designers from different places they're managing them directly  because that's the group that they manage  I'm going to put yourself in the shoes of someone who might be the only designer in their business and then he he merry go how do you convince the leadership in the business of the value of designed I there's a couple things I think the first thing to know is if you got hired as a designer they must value something they must value it so in some way I think it's mostly about again like the perception of what you do maybe might be different than what you're perception us of what you do   although like  you should bring that up maybe in the in the interview process   here now it's like I I guy  I don't think I've ever been blindsided by a I mean I've worked at three different start ups as the only designer and all three of them and I don't think any point was ever like man like this you don't understand what I'm doing here like they all definitely knew what they were hiring before we talked about an interview process then even thinking a couple named taught me some stuff that I should be doing and I didn't know I should be doing   it's a like a date you can kind of issue vetting that head of time  but then trust that like if you got hired they value you because they're they did it they're paying you they maybe they heard they needed designers they hire them hired you but then  like  they are paying you to be there so they they want to get the most value out of using its fought like proving that what you have to bring to it is valuable to the business  how do you measure and present design results of buzzfeed yeah so they're not we don't measure design results we measure product result like product outcome so like we do a lot of A. B. testing  some product managing maybe testing like tooling team and select open enough like about a year  is with tooling lets people run AB test pretty simply on buzzfeed although like all the consumer products on Twitter that right  feel like we've we've done great I think it's great design work that performs extremely poorly  and we've done because I work I think it's just kind of okay that performs pretty well like and it's kind of like you know  and at the end of the day I mean I am not here to make designs custom here we're all here for buzzfeed to be successful right we're here to make a business successful and if we're making calls based on our ego or based on our discipline that that's probably not a good idea  and then the telling teams we do what we like those teams are very hyper connect all of their like users are internal girl here right there all the building or they're all in an office and the office in a layer in the U. K. and   so they are tight tight like communication with those teams and they are working on this tools like testing the schools of those teams like giving them early looks things to play with them and like givens and came back and like that's like kind of user happiness and life of the business tools like kind of what they're measuring instrument unofficial a we're trying I'm hiring he's a researcher this year that I want to work on like making a little more measured for those teams I think that's like I would be really useful for them to not be kind of guessing about where they're out with that  yeah so they could design successes and like a metric it's more about the again like that output of like engineering and design and product and what is the result of that we get in with this last one as  the function of design continues to evolve  what are some roles and methodologies that you think will emerge over the next five years   I think as I will be a lot more invisible over time is something that thinking a lot lately  I mean you look at stuff like Alexis  or  the home and it's just like the first things   like some designing those systems I know some of those designers and like you'll never see it's not visible you'll never see it it's a system like there's a system designed happening that like the design things extremely useful  it like someone thinking about that experience and how the what the flow is of like if someone says this kind of thing how do we respond in like what's the track of that     that's something I think a lot of people are designers don't know how to do first of all I got deep system thinking is something it's just like a lot of companies make you do like I don't know that we do much of that you're busted outside of the internal tooling something gets really insane sometimes the light because their products are like it's not and it's not super complicated like system problem you know I mean like there's not it's not a deep deep white group problem that we're solving  so those are gonna be really interesting jobs I mean like like that will only grow it will become more complex and require more designers to think about it longer you know  have I don't even know what methodologies we can bring to that you know is probably that's always been thought of that were using old methodologies to try to solve this these problems with  A. R. is gonna be really weird I'm like pretty pumped for there was a movie are like I don't know how many are guy how many are and how many are guys here that's good I like the arts cool like it's fun I mean if I watch a movie or video play video games as need to like  augments yeah yeah but I don't like that word yeah like I would love to like and you can imagine like  having having no screen no computer screen and just like doing all your work like that's going to be a whole other thing you know I got it again like complete ever methodologies thinking about things completed from way   site yeah that's the thing I'm really excited about  now  well well thanks so much thanks a lot  he made it to the end congratulations thanks for watching the episode I really really hope you liked it if you did like it please leave us a review on the iTunes store and by the way if you have any questions that came up because of the content that that we covered with our guests going you to go on Twitter you can tweet us you can leave us a comment we'll get back to you will help you as much as possible at high rise podcast that's the the screen name or the handle for Twitter for Instagram for Facebook find us talk to us we want to converse with you out we're not going to leave here by the way without also thinking our friends at sorrel video they've been an amazing park on this entire project to Sir  video is a creative studio based out of Portland Oregon they've helped creative communities tell stories for over ten years they've done advertisements behind the scene footage  in documentaries for companies like Google slack XO XO festival adobe Intel they're incredible they've traveled with us through the entire country documenting these stories with our guests that's incredible thank you so much sorrow listen if your start up looking to elevate your product your big company looking to humanize your brand you're someone in the creative community you just want to tell a story you've gotta check out the team at several video it's Searle video dot com S.

       " \"Hey folks once again welcome back to the really is podcast I'm Zach Naylor co founder and CEO here to really S. as well as your host for the show our guests this time around is Michelle fits Patrick a senior product manager at inter com the very popular and growing customer messaging platform for apps and websites  Michelle and I had a chat about her time over the course of many years intercom going from a smaller team to very fast growing company and how to still make sense of your products and customers all along the way  she has a passion for applying an understanding of customers to her work as a product manager to make the best decisions prosper audible something I share passion for personally and she had a lot to share on how she and the inter county in does just that  shell even shared a few stories of how user research save the day from building the wrong thing as well as how they use customer research and feedback to make design product decisions in a calm  from a shell user research and creating a closer constant contact with intercoms customers and even the product help her build this sense of gut feeling or intuition that she really attributes to intercoms products access  she gave many tactical and practical examples of how to do this yourself in some stories and how she did so herself at inter com  it's a common theme here on the really is podcast that we hear so many never really guests talk about user research in building that intuition for your customers and how that is the most common factor for making successful products designs and features it's no surprise then that we built our own product really is to help you do just that really is is a user research and insights tool for designers researchers and product leaders to help you organize all your research and insights in one place  makes sense what you learned and share them with your team in order to make awesome design product feature decisions you can check it out for a fourteen day free trial over at our website a really a slab dot com that's W. W. W. dot A. U. R. E. L. I. U. S. L. A. B. dot com  okay let's get on with the show and our special guest Machel fits Patrick  welcome to really is podcast episode twenty five with Michelle fits Patrick she is a senior product manager at intercom Michelle walking the show  thanks for having me back absolutely so for those of us who may not know about intercom for those of us foolishly not using it  com is a product right now maybe give us a little bit of background of inner calm in the work that you're doing there  sure  so intercom is our communications platform for businesses to talk with their customers  it started off primarily as a way to talk with the people that are  signed up and logged into your products add to tell them about new features to get feedback from them or offer support I believe expanded I further  and that works on and I put on your marketing website you can talk with visitors and help try and engage them and get them to sign up for help sell to them as well  and we can use it at all stages of your communication lifecycle with your customers nice Wilson your senior product manager there tells a little bit about the role you play and write some of this   so as a product manager intercom I've been here a little over four years  and the role has mostly stayed the same and last time with what a product manager is responsible for an intercom I'm the way we work is we have  product team set up that owned a part of the product and within the team we have a product manager a designer and engineering manager and  maybe three to eight engineers and everybody on that team is responsible in different ways for solving customer problems as the primary role of the product manager is to define the problems that are as valuable for us to solve and then really old and at what the problem is and carry that threat old faces from when we figure out what problems we should be solving all the way through designing solutions building them releasing them getting feedback and all the research we do in between  the product managers role is to really keep that at the point of the problem we're trying to solve and front and center the whole way through  that's yeah that's a gets a really really great concise description too and I have one of the more clear ones I think of product management right yeah we we hear a lot of people talking about what product management is just as we do what is you acts and what is the role between those two right effort yeah for sure add added to come we as  we came up with this at Megan's been a number of years ago around basically who's accountable for what in the process going all the way from Hey here's an idea we should do until all customers are using it  and even though there's a lot of overlap primarily the product manager owns the problem the designer owns the solution and the engineers  in the execution of that  that in reality there's huge overlap between each of those but it gives us like a little bit of light clarity of at of kind of the pine trees between each role I have but inevitably lead we have engineers are having conversations around are we really solving the right problem or thought the problem should be solving with product managers poking and add details of design with designers and all parts of the process so this huge huge overlap between our roles throughout the process  the way we work here is everybody is sitting co located at sitting in a as same like bank of tasks we do  signed up together planning together so the team really works as a unit so that encourages all black collaboration between the different roles  but the the concept of the PM owning the problem is is pretty clear and I think that's that's kind of the easiest way to define what a product manager is primarily responsible for of course and there's lots of other things that we end up doing is all  okay awesome so though the one thing you said there too that is really the central theme around product management for for you an intercom is that the product manager owns the problem  can you just can you talk about that a little bit more maybe even in the context of  how you figure out the right problems are problems that are worth solving because you mentioned that too and I think that that's an extremely important point all right   okay so that's that is definitely a tricky one I think there's no   solid framework for for quantifiable Lee measuring which problems are more valuable than others I think there's always at a bit of judgment required from a PM  I am in terms of the problem  problem definition I think is the restroom we we have a four member we have that a single document it as short document like one to two pages at for every project that the PM is responsible for a filling item that that document  includes the problem definitions that's pretty so thank the kind of aim to be like in two hundred fifty words describe what the problem we want to solve is I will fight alluding to any solution  which can be tricky  and then we also includes a part arraigned how we would measure if we've solved this problem again without really being specific around the solutions are not necessarily going into specific metrics just yet but how would we know  if we solve this problem and that's usually the first as phase of the project is to articulate it I in this document and for me I find at that forcing function of trying to be really says saying  and describe what can be like an unwieldy entangled problem in like two hundred fifty words is a really really great exercise at being articulate and knowing what the value of the problem really is and how to actually pinpoint and what it is and really concise description at with by trying to sell it to people or whatever else you might be trying to to do to get your project off the ground I'm set since it's that yeah it's a really succinct way of doing as great forcing function and I find  for myself once I write those I'd add they merely serve the job for me I tend to not even look at them again by it by that stage I have a lot of clarity on what the problem is and that that carries me through the project as I'm interacting with all the different people that were working with on it sure well so this is interesting in and just to to kind of summarize that for everybody listening if there's  there's this document that you put together an intercom that is simply as possible I think you said two hundred fifty words give or take a couple times have to articulate what the problem is I have many questions coming out of that but I think perhaps the first an obvious one is well where does that come from where does that understanding of that problem so that you can properly articulate it come from  excellent question  so we we've got to stage four we've got a pretty good process for   creating in reviewing road maps for that teams I'm but that is as our process there has gotten a lot better more consistent the  the crafting of the road map  I guess is less well defined in this probably done slightly differently by each P. M. at into common depending on what product area they're working on her fourth the focuses I am usually there is a very close relationship with our research team to come it's quite small but  we were kindly with them and we have a lot of different inputs into this roadmap  and the there's probably a couple things like one is identifying the kind of the set of problems that we think Adam are most worth solving  and then it's figuring I as what is the order of which we should start at tackling these problems and then as we kind of figured that if I was working three each one to actually start digging in my articulating what that problem specifically is  in terms of  identifying all the problems with solving that's where we kind of look at all the different inputs that we have for a road map so  and we lean heavily on our customer support team is one where we have all of our  most common feature requests or areas of confusion in the products they are all the things that our current customers are asking is for  we also as has a good relationship with people and our sales team that are talking to prospective customers and we understand what things that they're looking for maybe things that they are looking for their product doesn't yet offered  we also look at M. and talk with we try our best to talk with a can be tricky to talk with a customer is that AT shirt and leave our product to find a what was it that didn't meet their needs  and then we periodically will do larger pieces of research  with like one much longer in depth interviews with kind of the target customers for a different product areas add to really kind of understand their needs  what were they what are they trying to get the product to do a probe really Hadley on on identifying those jobs ad that they have for the product  so with all of those inputs were gonna get this list of  of problems that we could tackle and and then we try and figure I will which are the ones that are worth tackling a which are the most valuable ones and for that there's probably a bit of  back and forth between the PM having just a good sense and what brings you here the most when you hear them what as which of those things customers have like the strongest feelings about it yeah that's something that you would like to have the speech your verses like all my god if I have to and came to this thing one more day and I can get this thing done as I'm just going to quit this product Evans like you you try and understand like the the magnitude of these problems  and then the other as strong input is ranger company strategy of I'm not just for the part of the product that I am the thinking of high that's feeding into all the other parts of the products that are being worked on what are all the other  product managers looking at doing so that as a whole at inter common things gets get shipped to release friend to come and make sense when they're bringing the product in the direction we want as opposed to having  a bunch of PM's building things and carrying off in different directions based on what they each thinks so it's really important that we have  of a coherent strategy that is helping us make these decisions are and what is important what are we trying to achieve with the products this quarter this year  and use that as a basis to help make a privatization decisions sure  that sounds like a lot of work  I am  stating the obvious  it is I cast like the reality is that most of that stuff is done and will not necessarily in like specific blocks of time it happens constantly and conversations with people all the stuff is I am just being absorbed by the PM so just  talking to lots of people within the company talk with customers very frequently reading lots of customer conversations every day  all of that just see you soak up this information and you build this kind of got science of as things that you start feeling are important sure sure  yes so we tend to do more like that and less like a we need to spend this week looking at Turner let's this week let's look at  feature requests or something yeah  well everything you describe their Michelle sounds to me like research  right we we might not traditionally call at that rate but when you're talking about your customer support team and you're talking about you know some of the reasons why people leave and and this is all this is all research user research to me a hundred percent yeah it is I am yeah because I think some is able to give you the research much more around like conducting an interview with people  and we do that as well am and I love doing that I think it's that it's after one of my favorite things especially a lovely loose unstructured interview and just got someone on a call or meeting in person and and just talk through understand their world what else is going on in their world turns that into com is not the center of their universe either in their lives or oftentimes in their job  I'm really getting a good understanding of of what part intercom plays in their in their work life what are they using it for what are they trying to do one of the other things are trying to date just  I think building back context is is hugely valuable to build that empathy as for customers and and help understand why they even log in and using this product to begin with   that helps us make as so many decisions especially the in person ones I find those winds and  they're much more memorable they can carry you through  so many decisions  but aside from that the other types of research I guess that we do is very very customer centric  it's much more exact than  like competitors or where I industry trends as thought inform some things and we obviously are always admiring that like any business  buy them but is very much around our current center potential customers I what are their needs  and that's the main thing that we focus on sure  well and you mentioned a number of  as you put it inputs to that road map  and I suspect those inputs are all those places that we might consider research I'm very curious  because because of my bias in what we do here to really is but I'm curious how do you manage all of those inputs you know how do you how do you start making decisions or or figure out what you learned from all these different places of customer important and what we might consider research insights  so we don't and we don't really have a lot of fast structured touring for this stuff and it over the years I've gone from being extremely diligent divided in trying to measure everything and then other times I'll be a little bit Lieser I'm winning I used to do a lot of was at times I I recorded download all of the feature quest my product area code them and I keep track of what things were increasing and decreasing and I have really granular coding  and then after a while it's doing that I realized I had just  build up the kind of innate sense of of what we're all the things people are asking about it and what was more important than another Alaska by the the bean counting up only got nine request for it this week and the seventeen for this other thing and you kind of just build up this more natural sense of what feels important and it's on a fairly the number of requests but again kind of like high  like how important is it in a more people are trying to do is it like just a nice to have for an essential thing I'm since being Kantian stuff doesn't add doesn't really get that across  but I used to be really really deliberative I thought I had a spreadsheet that was maybe like couple five seven pieces of feedback all coded really nice pivot tables at and then I just kind of stopped doing once I realized I had internalized so much but I'm of course that's not an easy thing to share always with other people but I am but it became like a at an unnecessary task I think that I may just I one thing I do is I it's set up like a  and daily email to myself the pulled at some customer feedback and just sent it to me every morning and I just scanned that one is on the way into work five minutes and it's going to read through it you just kind of keep that finger on the pulse of things that are coming up everything we see something it's kind of like yeah I've seen that before yep  that's new that's interesting let's dig into that and and that's really important for a PM just black staying really connected to your customers and your product just to understand is anything changing here  or are we starting to see a shift  or after we really something have we seen those request good dynamic something else is coming up  so that's always a really really important thing at de yeah  okay end up if one of things it's been sitting in the back of my mind I've been burning to ask since you even started talking about product management noting the problem and sort of this process  you know an intercom in for you where is designed to sit in all of this  you axe design right  many would argue sorry demeanor is meant many would argue that you X. design owns the problem right now I'm sure you've come across this argument for an up you be maybe they even had had that argument with some folks and you in the past  eight it as it's seven like a very close partnership I think and as we start getting to the phase of defining the problem that's when there's a lot of as a conversation between the PM and designer I would designer is thinking right the problem think about solving it  and that's when they all go like a lot of push back on weight is is this like is this the part of the problem we want to solve like how big is this problem like high fired we wanna okay deep do we want to go on this  because every problem we encountered it's never like neatly isolated it's always connected to another when connected to another one it just something else that we want to improve or change as a one part of  PM's well is really  thanks coping the problem of having those binders of like okay this is as far as we want to talk on this problem otherwise we'll we'll never get to at a solution or decision or will basically have be trying to redesign the entire product was link  so that's that's one part but then there's this kinda nice healthy tension of pushing back and forth as we start looking at solutions as come up with ideas  I figure I like it then you star probing is this really the problem maybe it's something else maybe we should or can we be tackling this problem in a very different way what are all the different ways we can tackle it and but there is a lot of that a lot of collaboration between then  I am the designer and oftentimes the designer will maybe take the problem definition and expand on it a lot further so go from kind of the very succinct version  and really break it apart and and add more color to it for the in as part of their process as well so surveys are definitely collaboration and and a little healthy tension sure in that healthy tension again just if I'm hearing you in keep me honest is really in the way of a designer maybe taking that problem definition in sort of stretching the boundaries of order testing the boundaries of it  yeah because I like the other thing is a PM that you're bouncing is and  thanks timelines for projects in a way  so we don't have the luxury of taking a problem and spending like months exploring solutions and and researching it intact this greatest that would be in as much as I'm sure we all love to really do that as we also kinda have a commitment with the engineers on our team that we're kind of planning that we're gonna spend maybe this much time on design so we're gonna be looking to start building this and  yes three weeks or four weeks so there's a there's a certain time boxing of like how much time do we want to spend exploring this problem more looking to solve it and and that's a nice where the role the PM comes in as well to to set those by injuries and give that focus and direction as so design can really folks and get to  really promising about able solution within a time frame and so that engineers can get involved at the right time because we really have to partner with them as well yeah that makes sense and actually that that makes me think of another question because  so we had a couple episodes of our our different track of the podcast you're called inside it really is it's just chose a phone I kind of talking about you know things are important us we're doing at the company and we've been very passionate recently about this idea of  engineers and technologists being part of research I'm curious you know how do they  how to how do you work with engineers and and and helping them understand the problem in understanding the the customer needs from that research inner calm are there other things you can share about that  sure arms I think one of the things that we do that I've noticed as very strand comes we hire very  hire engineers that how are curious and interested in product and interested in  how people are going to use what they're building and so as part of the interview process there interviewed by a product manager  such part of every engineering and interview them to come  so as a result of that the engineers I've worked with  across my time here all been incredibly curious about the problem we're solving a better  customers and also really curious about it  when we release something to customers heights being use water they say  it is working as a good like they're really really curious and eager to insure them what they're building actually has value in this purpose to it and it's not just a range of writing echoed or building something they think is cool and having it right there nobody using it off very satisfying I'm so that's one part as then we also include them in all phases of the  where most phases I think of the whole process from him up to design so I'll run walk through the roadmap  with the engineers and they'll have lots of questions and ideas  will do user testing and engineers will sit in on it  we're doing some user testing some concept testing  tomorrow and Friday it's something I'm my team of the researcher shared the shape of the list of interviews the time slots and engineers will be sitting in on some of those just to really understand   the our customers better and what they're looking for and and then I think of the other parts at all in terms of then  design and that's another huge aware as we start getting close to figuring out the solution that we're going to build  then we start partnering very closely with engineering  the men balls and it for like  these ability for their height ask for estimating this because I'm usually the designers in the PM have a good sense of like what is a what solution would involves like a huge minds of engineering efforts persons like something more straightforward  but will partner very closely with the engineers and they'll work on kind of initial  explorations and some of the new ideas as really early before we've kind of been settled on the final and design so they'll they'll input at into Latin they'll they'll explain some trade offs that we should be making so there's a good a good partnership  last season the process too nice so there really involved kind of threw out but you know the thing there I I believe it's a little bit harder to take down is that you say intercom looks for curious engineers they look for people who are  interested in understanding how people are using it and and why it matters to them right a hundred percent yeah and I interview engineers all the time in here  with injuries every week a few different addicts every week so and all the product managers and so the product designers are involved in those interviews as well yeah  alright let's zoom back out a little bit and talk about how all this research makes a good decision  I know that that's something that you're passionate about and  and I would say   it least in my opinion as being a customers of inner calm and I think many others would agree  so far you're doing a pretty good job with that so let's how does that happen how does research inform what a good decision is product for Iran  we definitely we don't have fun  I guess that process for high we do research on every project  problem it it may very so much  in terms of ambiguity of the problem with the complexity of it or  or high much kind of conviction we have fun what we want to builder or what the idea is I'm so it's actually quite interesting for some things we've done and we definitely kind of  god on both ends of the spectrum on it we've dined at someone's far too much research on very small projects and we really kind of gone into the details in ways that looking back we're probably a bit unnecessary we could've been in it scrap here and then other times we've done some big projects with relatively little as a user researcher user interviews  and that's been also quite interesting  and so some of the things that I find over my time is really to only to to think about how you're gonna spend your research time  we don't have we don't have a few researchers dedicated researchers in income like lots of times that PM's will do some research themselves  but the decision and to use research I think it's it's really only valid if you read there are generally have something that you need to learn that you can't flared with by doing at was I doing interviews are doing deep research or if you're like willing to change course based on the findings of that research  I think a lot of times looking back we probably done research at a rate very low level details and really to get confirmation of our decisions which is kind of it's a little bit lazy in a way and it's it's quite expensive way to do it  I had to kind of make decisions  where is usually you can just make a decision and and go with it you don't need to you test up so everything especially if you're just hoping at the research will come back and give you a thumbs up at you're you're basically planning for that to happen that's like a a terrible way to to use research  we definitely have projects in the past where  we've done research and then come back on their decision and change talked a few times and that's always a hard one to do at PM especially if your  if you're pushing for something and you're really invested in it to actually kind of  all the billing okay I think maybe this is not the right direction definitely  I'd actually love to hear a lot more about that if you have any specific example because I think that that shows great maturity in a product organization in fact yeah  thank there is what I'm  there is one last year that we definitely and that caused a lot of at  circling I guess we we have this concept and so the part of the product I was working on at the time was the inbox an intercom so that this is the place for teams work together to see the conversations that are coming in from the messenger  and respond to those  no one of the  problems were looking at tackling was how to better prioritize  conversations with in the inbox and  privatize the customer is your you are responding to you and we look to lots of different solutions of one of them that we came up with which we thought was just SO clever and was this idea of these like dynamic were smart in boxes and they would be like a view of your inbox based on some filters about who the people were  or what the conversations where she could say show me all the open conversations with my V. I. P.'s based in a better in French or something  so we had to come up with this concept of this really flexible and box system  when we tested it was customary is and they did not get it addled they thought it was really confusing and they it totally over search their needs and most of people we talked with did not need this superselect dynamic at in boxes that she just needed a better way to see the list of ones they already had and they had much simpler more basic needs and we were thinking more like but we have all this data arraigned at who your customers are like who the people writing into our what the conversations by it we could build something that would create the smart views based on those and add people actually find it really confusing and we got to a point where we were like well we we just keep going maybe they don't realize this great New World so we're trying to build for them and we realize we actually have to pull back and the dress kind of the more simpler problems as that we had in the inbox that needed addressing before we started adding more complexity to it and and that  remember that project was tricky because  we had kind their faith thank bank online yeah we'll get some learnings but we'll keep progressing here  and and that meant that basically engineers were  getting ready that in a few weeks they'd be starting to build less and the I was on a road map we were communicating to the teams that this is the price next project we're taking on and this is the direction I was going and I course when you as change course on that there's lots of other people impacted stands near thing to figure I'd or we need to figure out with them okay if it's not this what is it that we're going to work on at least tell other teams that that's not happening we're doing something else  so it's not as it is there's more like visibility of the change like of the river  changing direction than just kind of within research at because it's so connected to all the other teams and people in the company  so that was probably one and then if there's like us a slight frantic like okay that's not this that we're building what are we doing a reading something with that  we do nothing with it  and that's tough because about point you needs like that product in design side need time to M. digested and think about what we should be doing instead  yes well so how is that received I mean I don't think that that as you describe it I have to believe that other people have had at least I hope a similar  situation occur to them in in this case though  I am a little bit biased and home saying this but research save the date it save it solid you from not building the wrong thing a hundred percent owners is definitely the the right call at yes is something I I think just in the way that our product teams work if it doesn't happen that often but it's not and it's not a negative for seen as a negative I definitely requires like okay we need to change plan and we need to figure out how can we change plans quickly what you would be doing instead at but it's not and is never seen like a as a failure it is always like a a positive and always the sooner you can learn that before you invest more time into something by far the the better at so I think everybody else ought also sees sees back benefit  well yeah that's that's that's awesome and it's it's nice to hear that story because I think a lot of people who are who are designers are researchers arm  probably love to hear that to say Hey the work we do save the day it can and Hey look at this year's this example and write it you know in where it did there something else that you kind of talked in about their  I do not expect to talk about but it's interesting because I have personal experiences as well which is all of a sudden we pull the rug out under ourselves because we say  Hey this is not the right thing to build based on the research we did move  the thing that's interesting there is that you said okay one hour of a sudden everybody scrambling to say well what should engineers be working on  I'm actually just very curious like why does this culture exist because it's everywhere it's but it's a pretty much every company I've been at where all the sudden we have this this  anxiety that we have to keep technology in engineering busy all the time we have to have we have to be feeding them work all the time yeah  M. great question this is a may have been thinking about that a lot I I I I find it so that it is a real challenge like the the sequence of work between I figure at the road map figure out what problem does all working on the design and then getting ready to build a means a little bit water folly anyway but that's kind of the sequence of things I am each of those phases  aren't always proportional to each other so makes planning and people's time quite tricky sometimes things will take like five weeks to design and think about it and then it turns out that the solution that we got to is only going to take two weeks to build and then you're like okay  right we've got like one designer to four engineers here and all of a sudden we've spent our time like disproportionately on one of the other than these other projects that will add design in a couple weeks it will take many many weeks to build MC are constantly have this and this balance because we operate as like one team and everybody works together  between the engineers and designers it's not  we don't have like a separate bank of engineers to a team of designers and they just Haas work over when it's ready and and the engineers take the next available thing I am so there is that that partnership and and that the runway as I call it between design and and engineering how much of a room we we build up sometimes like it's eaten up really quickly at other times it grows longer you're you're trying to keep  at just the right amount of gap between a design and engineering so design has enough space to explore but they need to and every visit things that they need to they don't feel that engineers are fighting on the heels but also that they're not too far ahead so that engineers are involved in that process a bit I am but it's that's definitely at at tricky one to manage I mean they can always we always have via our lovely tech death backlog and issues that can be done and things that can be everywhere slide  engineers also want to work  but again because we hire quick weight product focused engineer is as there's always a lot of satisfaction out of  now building something valuable sometimes that is tact that's nuns it's fixing issues  and sometimes it's building some some new functionality to solve a problem yeah that makes a lot of sense and I like the way that you worded it in this in terms of this building run where this space between art design and engineering is  yeah you're right I mean the the balance there is difficult because you want and as you say you do it in a calm you want those folks who were in technology actually part of forming the the the the definition of the problem to then act on a solution  but maybe not so close as to where it's constricting of being able to explore that problem space right right and that's again that's another healthy tension to help like  you know if a little bit of pressure can also be good to force decisions and so  there is that at a good element of that in terms of we we don't have the luxury of unlimited time as so kind of having having that is that as of voicing and function on a kind of when we need to get something at least something done buyer ready buyer or ready to even start building and exploring and testing and that's kind of it that's a good as a good deadline for PM's and designers to have a mind nice  nice  you know I I I see that were we're coming up on the end of our time and I am quite sure that we could discuss these things for three times as long as we have but unfortunately we don't see and I wanna be respectful that for you in all areas I'm curious if there is  I started asking this is the end of all of our podcast if there's something let's say I had temporary amnesia and I forgot everything that we talked about you know what what would you say is maybe the most important point  that we cover today that people listening should really remember  great question and I think it is that as staying close to the people that are using your product and single sack your actual product itself a is just invaluable in helping you build at a good sense of what you should be doing as a product manager and I I think it's it can be very easy to get the tax from that dust with the nature of all the things that are going on in your company in your industry all the time and and not spend enough time in that but  the closer you stay to customers and and internalize and what it is their needs are at that just helps you make really quick decisions from having a good sense of what you should be doing in on that applying at your road map all the way down to like low level trade offs that you might get in the middle of a project you know should we do acts or wire or should we watch the defaults be air I'm understanding those needs and deeply understanding the makes you just have that really instant got sense of what the decision should be  awesome okay  all right very good  is there anything that you'd like to share with folks listening today that we maybe didn't talk about a cover in the show  well I think that we have at this time of and  great information and insights and thoughts on our end to come blog which you're probably familiar with so inside intercom it's blog dot intercom dot com ad that's really the best source to go and if you're curious about any of the stuff we write a by product management and research and how we build our company and our product all the time I'm aware expanding but I am constantly so there is a curious there's tons more information they're awesome we'll make sure we have a link to that in the show notes and then you know on that note I guess is there  is their best place to reach you of other folks maybe wanna wanna reach out have specific questions  follow up with something you discussed yes Sir are you can grab me on Twitter Chile fitz I'll give you that spelling words you can just paying into it to come into our messenger and ask for me and somebody will pass the conversation over to me and they'll they'll call you over the intercom at inter com I really I really hope that there's at least a real live intercom somewhere in your offices  there is  I don't know I don't know we have a proper into combo which we should get one I think that that's absolutely necessary at least in one office that you have  just to talk to the other offices to be good one yeah oh yeah absolutely that that's a perfect idea  okay Michelle thank you so much for for joining the show today I know I've really enjoyed the conversation I think everybody listening and have a much better idea of how we make decisions based on what we know from customers and  and how to how to manage some of the struggles between that stuff  thank you so much travel I really enjoyed it too absolutely alright everybody we will see you next time  if you enjoy this episode consider

       " \"by Margaret Kelsey and this is the sixteenth episode of design talks web in our series brought to you by invision today debate Darman team shares with us the one type of user research that will transform your company let's listen in  X. Margaret thanks for having me it's  it's an honor to be here so yeah let's kick off by saying a few things about myself right that it helps a little bit to say who the speaker is concerned ability and I want to start by but it's it's it's it's an honor to be here and and kind of made me think a little bit back up to the challenges of art of the possible people ask me so they'd what exactly do you do right so I kind of see myself as a person that's with both products my background is very heavily productive worked on interfaces and  experiences for quite a long time but equally up I've done a lot of work in marketing so I kind of see myself really there like in the mid in and and and yet these whips with hard earned and I'm with my work as a consultant in the past this has been I think a big advantage and at the same time the more we work with both product and marketing teams it's it's interesting to see how I think more and more people are going to start working out at the cross section between the two and so that's kind of what I kind of call like a technical markets and or or or a marketing designer right so it's it's interesting to see how these two words are working together so in terms of of my backgrounds and as I said I'm passionate both product and marketing of work for consulting for quite a long time and I said I've ended up specializing in gross so pretty much making changes that are expected to have an impact on the bottom line at least being able to measure them  and and in the context of my career over the last kind of decades of launched a lot of tests right Sir actually measuring these changes to see what the impact was and and I've been lucky enough to work with some really awesome brands huge Browns global brands and yet been lucky enough to be trusted to kind of delivered to them so wins but also some some not so wins rights and someone else is what  but that's how we learn so that more recently I am also the CEO and founder of hard during  and how does is used quite a lot will overturn the thousand sites now we're growing quite fast and also we've been lucky that business wise of also performed really well and and the businesses is growing  quite fast and I don't mention these things to kind of show offer anything but in a way it's a testimony of what we're going to look at today right that's the methodology that's kind of influence how we've been the best business and some of the winds we sat and but also like to say that and why some of the content you're gonna look at today will feature a chore it's what I'm talking about days not about such a right so there's as many of you know there's many tools out there that you can use but obviously hundred US feature parts of the content that I talk about purely because and let's see my career influenced me or inspired me to build hearts are right so it's it's kind of and pretty much very well connected with with with who I am so yes so I'm on the notes I'll stop the webcam because I know that's not the most interesting things to look after them and let's jump into the slides  so what to do was actually starts with  my evolution right so let's give some kind of context and and the story behind where I kind of started off in this journey to discover this methodology right this idea of using user research to transform businesses so in the very beginning when I started off in my career some of you might identify with this but you typically starts being obsessed with aesthetics and styling how things look and I've worked with many businesses that are kind of tend to focus on the stage as well like with projects called project slick or whatnot maybe you've heard that before and I then moved on to to build a team and start doing more testing and be more focused on the numbers and measuring the impact so we do a lot of lay out to what's called multifarious testing thank god it's not that much in vogue anymore it's it's this idea of splitting like it experiencer page into different areas and then putting in multiple variations for each and this kind of gave us wins but it gives good results but it tends to kind of  end up with diminishing returns and then the next phase of what I see is my evolution was a kind of this this parts where I started to discover the impact of copy right of text and how important it is to the experience and and and the design that sense right on the results at the end of the day and at the same time it was also focused on okay if we can't have tests they give us great results let's do more tests right but actually it was interesting that during this phase of my career actually realize that more tests actually gave us worse results overall because we were just so focused on velocity and then came the last phase right which is kind of what we're going to be talking about today which was really  M. start to focus more on user feedback listening to the users and and then spending more time to to compile that research I know many of you are probably have done this  and basically doing bigger changes in bigger which in today's session we're going to be talking about  how you can do user research in a very simple way and still have big impact it doesn't need to be very complex research so yeah  what did I learn throughout the journey  the first one is the best practices sock rights and and the thing is it's so easy to get caught in this trap which is  this big brand that this sort of  look at this awesome experience maybe we should do its rights but it's essentially a mistake to think what others have done might actually work for you purely because obviously you have different challenges and even if it is a competitor your customer base our user base is probably still quite different your legacy as a company is different and who you are as a pro this different right so obviously stealing tactics or or copying other people is typically a good idea the problem is and this is the marketing side of me speaking is that there's so many people out there writes that in the roles that they're building contents which is interesting and what their blogs to do really well right so unfortunately there's so much and kind of investment into building these awesome best practices  the second thing I learned is that there is simply too much data and I'm by this I mean we kind of live in the face of big data but it's may be so big that it's to the point where we kind of still sometimes lose contact with with kind of reality right in the things that are are important will be called the more qualitative sites and  and then this is interesting coming from the right the see of a software company the other thing that I learned is that the best tools are actually free and what do I mean by this like I noticed there was a phase where and myself and my team actually spent too much time stuck behind screens and and tools and looking at data and and it's easy to forget that actually the most important thing of all if you're going to do anything with it should be to listen to observe and actually speak your customers and your users right so so the empathy part is really important thank god no one has yet found a way to put the subscription around these right so it's important for us to remember that this should be the thing we should be focusing on week a week day on day  so  because of these three key learnings M. I found that in order for to keep myself coming on track and focused and I want to develop a methodology for my team and this is something that evolved over time which would give me what I call the big picture now what do I mean by big picture it's it's a simple concept  it's it's it's the equivalent of if if like if we consider what we're doing within their organizations but the brand but at the end of the day improving experiences impacting the bottom line in some way it's it's kind of like a game right and let's see if you were playing chess it's really difficult to make that next move towards a win if you come see the full board so in a way the big picture approach this methodology is all about making sure you're always keeping your your eye on the on on on on the big picture in the things that really matter and what I found is that it's effective to kind of break down this big picture to three areas so no matter whether it's a size zero sites it could be an apt and whatever the experience is there is always three kind of and let's say points right there's one entry points and to exit points in the end of the day so the M. two points is basically all about drivers so what is bringing visitors to your site what is bringing users to your app why are people actually taking the time investing their time to kind of use what you have been or what you've you've created and and these digs deep right so here with drivers are going to look soon what this actually means but we're talking about getting to know the person is and what exactly are the challenges that they're facing and I'm if if there are if they're telling us that what the needs  is it really like we don't stop there we actually dig deeper and understand like what they're actually looking for is a hold writer  what is actually needed for them to hang a picture on the wall right so so the drivers is digging deeper understanding that background because that gives context and  what is body is right so it's the second point which is an exit points and typically most people that come to us the hard during like to use the tool they typically focus on is what their people leaving where they're not doing what I expected them to do and this is important rights but it's it's both the where and the white and so it's it's understanding which are your pain points and I'm right where it's not necessarily a page for rights it's it's we're kind of what stage and and what what what was it the trigger it it's and the why of its rights like what was the reasoning and the third point is actually the one which I found is the least understood and the least kind of actually investigated which is what I call hoax so what is it that persuaded your users are visitors to do what they actually did it rights was it's kind of your pricing was it the bread was that the design was it a mixture of these things and what I like to think about is like painting this picture is is kind of very powerful to have all these three elements visible at one go for both you and your team it's very effective for you to understand when you're making the small tactical changes to have this kind of backdrop and and its impact the the the decisions you make so obviously beautiful design skills here right so I still still manage to use Photoshop every now and then and basically the idea is we do this methodology we did been touch are from all the things that we did learn rights working in the in in this industry and we want to teach our own dog food right so what we've done is if if we're kind of trying to build up to and and the methodology that we want our used is to use that we should use that are set up so what I wanted to share with you today is basically what we've done a charger actually using the to ourselves so looking at recordings of people actually using larger doing surveys with them and actually doing funds to see where people are dropping off so this is just quick examples and basically by doing this it  allow this to build what we call the big picture worksheets now if you are interested in having this kind of template you can just go get a big picture worksheets are big picture hajj are there's a PDF that you can use I find this to be extremely powerful to have printed out here my office and and basically we went through the exercise our sense of using not just how much are right there are multiple other tools like views for example you're going to take some extra hundred kind of gets to filling out this worksheet  and I don't have the time today to go into all these details but the slides will be sure to do so it's interesting to see kind of what the big picture looks like for a larger as a company but I want to pick up on one particular use case right because today we're talking about  user research can transform your business right so I wanted to take one example from here and just show you how powerful this thing can so I'm going to  also you to look in the bottom right corner here where we have a top three fears or concerns right and this is kind of part of the whole specter it's so what are the reasons that persuaded them to convert but also in the process what was it that nearly stopped them right nearly stopped and that's so powerful to discover it was interesting that we discover that was cost and price we were surprised in a way you're right because hunters quite the for the bill yes our plans for bigger at new data needs to go higher but it was interesting to see that so we were kind of surprised so let's dig deeper rate because we didn't expect to see that there and so we looked at our pricing page we said okay so this is the page were pretty much all pricing decisions and opinions are kind of being formed right this is kind of the gate twenty where someone who's deciding whether to use or journal to the value waiting our pricing and someone who used to using the app is coming back here to evaluate which plan to go rights okay this is a good place to start so we decided to ask a very simple and straightforward question on this page and  the question was this super super is our pricing clear and if not what would you change and this is something that we as you can imagine set up literally within minutes and we had to replace coming in instantly and was really really interesting start seeing what our users have to say not typically when I speak to people use our during I I show than this the typical objections they have is all my god it looks so ugly or oh my god I don't want to interrupt my users or oh my god this might suspects conversion rates stuff right but the reality is that I can actually disapproval three well maybe that it's not likely because that is quite subjective and but at the end of the day  whether this looks good or not and and its objective to think how it impacts kind of the experience in the end you really cannot afford to not know what your visitors are thinking right so think of it as a small time window where you're reaching out and asking a question maybe it's not the most amazingly elegance and sophisticated aesthetically pleasing way of doing it but it gets the job done right and it's important to understand this because then you can go back and have a big impact on on the experience so let's look at how this impacted us so what was interesting was the besides the poll we also did he did something that we typically do and it's also a tip we also gifts essentially it's kind of examining a page in the way kind of how it's being used at the same time wire people using it the way they do and it's kind of it's kind of looking at something from two different angles anything it's powerful because I kind of cooling call this process connecting the dots writes what are they doing and what are they saying the first this was insane because basically what we discovered was that in the feedback everyone was talking about one area which is what we call it snapshots right it's it's the size or the amount of data that you records when you're creating say I keep that purports or form reports or collecting like video replays recall the recordings of what people are doing on your in your app or in your site  it was interesting you see that red area there and he laughed was interesting was that consistently there was always a lot of attention specifically on what is called the song or the data collection right which are two very different things we're saying hold on where people speaking so much about this aspect but that interacting and and kind of typically we don't see that typically we see alignment so is it okay that's that's the deeper so so we spoke to some of our users and basically what they said to us was they were completely confuse  they were so confused  they didn't even realize that they were completely two different dimensions the way we price and what's interesting was that we were equally confused because we had no idea that this was happening and it's interesting because as a company we consider ourselves to be close to our customers we speak to them and that's where we invested heavily into supports we we keep records of what people say to us but because  they didn't know what they did in their own right they couldn't give us this feedback so it's quite interesting that just by looking at this in in the way we did we uncovered this really confusing confusing discovery  so what did we do  we jumped in we looked at some recordings of actually people interacting with this page to see what was the flow what did they do before what were they doing after and that was interesting to give us some empathy we actually had some and use the tests and in this case moderated right so we were kind of doing the remotely asking them to to basically show us the pricing and they show us in the app what they thought what's meant walks and this obviously the more we dug deeper the more we were literally shocked that kind of we had missed this completely  so the big question is what do we do about that's right this is the transformation parts and this is really important right because you can't have the insights but you need to do something with it so  we're lucky because obviously we created the methodology and we are the founders of the business and it's part of our DNA  it's it's part of our culture's values to kind of act on feedback in put feedback at the center of the way we run the business sonar case the first thing we did was pretty much in our next quarterly review we said okay let's look at our product roadmap it's the kind of take road map let's rethink how we can make this much more intuitive and I'm I'm basically rethink completely also the way we price the products are then this is not a small thing it's it's a it's a huge thing  we also though did not wait to kind of just through the big stuff right that is more long term basis said okay let's look at all the other questions we had on this pulled right so we austere member the question was if you have any question like what was it like what is confusing so we said let's address pretty much every question that we got on the page and the way we did was we split down the responses by percentage so if if for example forty percent  of all of the responses relates to one query then let's let's really get forty percent of all kind of the area on the page dedicated to this kind of consent right so it kind of we waited and how we kind of changed the experience to the feedback that we were getting the big impact we also started working on a new in app experience and pricing structures so we've just announced this to our user base this week so it's it's really exciting am and and one thing which is huge in the experience in itself which is if people are struggling with this and they don't understand our Jr works then we'd leave really need to make it effortless right intuitive and so what we're doing is we're invested quite a lot of at Dave resources not didn't just building a feature this time or functionality but actually showing how the product is collecting data and putting our user in our customers in control of kind of of the limit so we hope that this at least based on the feedback we're getting from users we hope that this was a big impact on on how they understand the product is working  besides that we also organize the hackathon were reluctant to pricing structure with not so we literally met up we flew we're remote company right so we have people all over the world but we few people in small talk we spent some time in the office and we looked at how can we quickly create  solutions together and then literally jump on on a call with our customers and our users and get there quick reaction and then and and change from there  so in other words what I'd like to call this and this is an important theme from a transformation standpoint is that we actually give a damn right and this is important because there's two things that I want to leave with you today which is the user research methodology aspects right so it's a two one it's a powerful way to identify opportunities for improvement and the second thing is a way of thinking which is actually giving it up now most of you might be thinking how the hell can I do this from my team writes in a big organization how my gonna bring all these things together and I think there's two things that I can say which is one bring people with you when you work on this type of project so use tools and where you can actually bring the team on board so obviously I don't advertise Roger but to the culture for the week kept the team in mind so don't kind of isolate yourself as a team and use a tool like cooking at six hard earned mixed kind and  any survey tool right and and and isolate the people and and sit on that data so invite people to join you visualize it for them creates meetings and events where you can share this right we had uses a hardware that sent the photos and videos of them where they organize small in turn of events and where they kind of shows the power of this this insights and actually visualize how people were actually really using the site that what they have to say and and many people in the team were shocked by what was our coverage right so bring people with you and then second find the champion rights so governance's importance by governance we mean find like a V. P. anti rector someone who is high up and hopefully involved in both product marketing support someone who can actually a champion this concept for you right and then in the end rights if if your organization is not giving a damn and you're the only one giving at them then yeah I think you know what you need to do and so how can this work for you rights I don't want to just give you this example and say Hey we're do  amazing stuff so I want to give you some some really specific examples and the questions you can be asking to build and this kind of worksheets for yourself and identify these opportunities so  let's look at how we can put the three pillars of the practice so first is drivers right so ownership with you some of the questions which are kind of my favorite the one that I've worked the best for me so I'd like to ask how can we make this page better how can we make this experience better might seem like a very simple question but having tried many variations actually leading with a hollow and seeing better kind of you're not raising the bar too high and it's a very easy entry points to see like where where they feel like they we can kind of be changing experience from raising the bar and second question is what exactly did you first hear about this something you might be thinking why is this important it's important because it gives you context rights of like you can literally visualize the journey of how they exactly came to here right so it actually gives you important information about kind of the chain of events that led up to the experience and gives you again that big picture of okay so this person's coming from that background or the company didn't we getting people are hearing from there and there and you might be seeing but yeah whether textiles they can give me source right but this is not fixed not it's not the same thing rights so this allows you to understand like what are the influencers on people kind of coming to you  and then finally why are you looking for solution today right where are you looking for this type of experience today so this allows you to understand that the war of the challenges that they are facing where are they coming from writes a dig deeper Elizabeth into and kind of the root cause of of why why they're actually using your ex your your site your app  in terms of targeting like who would you go off to here so this is where you want to go with with pages or areas of your app or site or pages from your site where you are seeing the most activity rights or where you have the biggest entry points and the reason being is you want volume responses here if you want a lot of people kind of giving your replies you wanna try showing the question quite quickly so for example five seconds so you don't want this to be delayed door triggered by specific events you want to be quite quick naturally you're gonna get a small amount of people might say Hey give me a second I'm just getting started or you might actually get some kind of  very interesting let's say yeah creative responses but obviously you just put those aside and and focus on the value that you're getting  barriers and my favorite questions here quick question what stops you from signing up to date what stopped you from actually adding this to the court's what stopped you from creating this reports right this  it's pretty much unlimited now you can adapt to steer business taken action or an event that is important to you or or related to a project that you might be working on analyst what stop them from doing that's right and  the second question is what are your main concerns or questions about could be the brand name it could be a feature it could be a piece of functionality rights so it's it's good again to to dig deep on a human level like what are your concerns what questions do you have and you'd be really surprised how with this question works and you might again be asking is if I get this quite often like people want reply to this the reality is our serves as people who wore the builders and creators of the optimizer is we don't typically kind of fits in to the to the target group of people to reply to these questions but you'd be surprised especially with fans of people who love your to your to your solution what you've been how much they want to actually help you improve it so you'd be really surprised by the response rates  in terms of target things would you go off there so I'd say target pages with the biggest drop in in fun and so I find it is basically where you map out kind of the steps to go from start to end right so you can you can clear the funded in any way you want to pending on what you're trying to achieve so identify the step for you are getting the biggest drop off and then I asked the question there so in our case right so we look to people that we're going from home page sign up sign up steps registration going inside the app that may be creating a heat map so we identified where were the biggest drop off points in in that journey  and then we ask these questions there start by showing the question when users are abandoning I'd like to start from there so most survey type tools they allow you to show a question when actually someone is showing intends to leave or abandon the page and or also the to the lights kind of for those of you are more technicians kind of loss of control this from a Java script point of view reserve if you're using up  let's say I'm  a single page app and someone is leaving an experience you can answer your that's rights and so that's a great way to start if you don't get responses than just increase that and and maybe go for more blankets approach of hitting getting more people  I'm fine the hawks so quick question what persuaded you to sign up to add this to your car to use this functionality to upload a photo to download the software right so it's really important to dig into what are the persuasion points this is really powerful and  and then thanks for whatever you did how are you planning to use its right again so this is the whole and understanding what is the root cause rights and this this definitely allows us to also for example Taylor the experience and so that we pretty much make it more specific to the use cases that they mention right quick example here is working with an ecommerce sites and I help them set up some polls rights to understand and how they were planning to kind of use the bicycles that they were sending it was interesting that we identified some interesting themes around wait and and and this sparked a lot of ideas for them to kind of create and let's say tools were you can input your way ten type of space you have at home and how you're gonna use it and kind of give you recommendations right this is what we need to be thinking about which is making that experience effortless and intuitive as much as possible  and then targeting wise  to reach how do we get these answers solvency target the thank you pages or our success pages are sexist steps and but again sure the lady you don't wait too long the quicker you get this response the more fresh the experiences in their minds and and you can target multiple thank you pages using like contains all schools have this right so you can kind of expand this to kind of look at multiple different experiences and group them together  so I also want to leave you with some interesting tips within the school within this context so I mentioned this already find or be the champion for change really important especially if you're struggling or think you're going to struggle within your organization to get this done and  show what you have described the discover to the organization help them empathize with empathy is a key key theme here put them in the shoes of the user show them are they using the product and what they have to say and you're fine the champions team work together  and also create a task force him to to build your big picture together I tossed force meaning and open up to let's say if you're in products to people in marketing and supports to to kind of come together this this big picture together  yes Sir can more tactical  tip don't force on says into buckets when asking questions you sometimes it's actually interesting of I've seen this tip which is used you start with the kind of   I'm a multiple of kind of a multiple choice question or like a  billion kind of question in order to get things started so did you like this experience yes and no and then you follow up depending on yes or no with a question for that but at the end you always want to be be collecting like these big white boxes right so qualitative juicy comments right because you need to be able to read this in order to truly empathize  and this is the boring parts but it's a good tip you then download the replies what I talked about before and you start kind of marketing them  by seem to see on the top and what I usually do is I read quickly through let's say one hundred two hundred responses and then  I start to identify the themes and then I read through them again and start putting them into each call that  this is kind of a little bit of a painful things actually not  we're we're really starting to kind of try to type with ideas of how we can put this directly into the survey itself that's something I look forward to and and yeah and then use the exact same words your user using the replies right in this is interesting  whether you're in marketing our products or or or or support like the ability to connect with your user is when your ex explaining something to make sure the kind of the experience connects and it's really important to also look at what are the exact words that using one of the phrases they use and and and for example I highly highlighted the mains here and this is an interesting example through that same poll we looked at before that survey we asked on the page on our pricing page we saw that everyone was pretty much saying the maids but we say sites and on our site so that was interesting and it was interesting to dig into the support matrix and to see we had so many questions also they're asking us like how many the maze can I use this on so that was that was an interesting discoveries which  so so yeah so we've come to the end I just want to summarize with five confinement take aways and we can open up for questions and as we said best practices suck for the really big wins and by winds I mean whether to split the story change or transforming the business right first get to know your users get that big picture and  connect the dots between analytics and feedback and the ability to look at an experience from both what people are doing and why they're doing it is is really valuable   yourself to be surprised and ask questions investigates follow up face to face really don't be scared to get out there you'd be surprised how many of your users are really came to help you out  give quick feedback on your new concepts by speaking to users I'm assuming most of you already knew that already do this my point would be too early like we do in our thoughts right just jump in there as quickly as you can  dear find the champion to bring the whole organization with you supervisor was super important M.  I finally give a damn right in the end I could you don't act on the feedback and insights you collect it's kind of pointless right and as I said and put yourself in a position in an organization in a role where you actually can get at that  and that's it  fantastic so we're right up at the top of the hour  so unfortunately that's all the time we have today but David thank you so much and a big thank you to everyone who attended today I hope you have a great rest of your day and keep designing awesome things  brilliant thanks so much for having me it's been a pleasure here we're huge fans so it's been an honor as I said in one of you out there in the spirit of feedback I'd love to hear from you on Twitter so connect with me sure feedback if you have questions that we did not today feel free to ask me directly love to hear from you thanks again  \",\n",
       " \"hi my name is Tom Bergeron and I'm a Google search user experience researcher and the author of lean user research  I'm here to help you ask your customers users and potential customers better questions and get even better answers converse like a talk show host think like a writer understand subtext like a psychiatrist and have an ear like a musician this beautiful thing was said about interviewing people and interviews gathering information through direct dialogue  before you start an interview though ask yourself why before you get into the how to phrase the questions  think about the reason you're there what is it that you're trying to learn  a key aspect of interviewing people is getting familiar with the phenomenon that is called rationalization rationalization is when people when asked about a certain situation that happened in the past fifteen to change reality a little bit to be perceived as good people to be perceived as smart people the example I have for this  is if I ask you  would you throw a banana peel on the floor  if nobody's looking you would probably say no I don't do that I'm not that kind of a person but given the opportunity to no one is looking two weeks from now you might do that and it's not because you're a bad person it's not because you  you don't believe in what you say or you're trying to lie to me you rationalize you want to be perceived as a good person as a helpful person  when you interview people when you ask people questions look for the story this is the most important thing in an interview ask about stories about things that happen ask about behavior for example so in that situation you keep quiet and see what people say better yet if possible asked to observe behavior if you're asking how they read email how they check their email Aston to show you that show me how you do that  ask about perceptions not because you're interested in them but because they will help you again to pull out the stories for example what is the difference between X. and Y. not a very interesting question but it might cause them to remember something about something interesting that happened  the most important thing in an interview is what is something that doesn't look like the most important thing follow up questions these will tell you give you a lot of insight into what really happened why do roll your eyes when you say that what do you mean  why do you call your phone my third arm these are extremely helpful in understanding behavior  a few don'ts  don't ask people about the future three questions product developers tend to ask their interviewees are would you use the product would you pay for it and how much you pay for it these are all very very bad questions why because they ask people to predict the future the problem is people have no idea the even bigger problem is that they think they do have an idea and they answer  another don't is lied about leading the witness  don't insert your opinion into the questions you're asking and then buy a seeing your interview ease into understanding what you're looking for and then give you the answers that you want to maybe don't intimidate if you are stand over the shoulder of someone who's sitting and then ask them a question that is an intimidating body language don't do that that will affect how they answer your your question  don't explain the question shut up and see what happens when you ask a question sometimes their silence from the other side  maybe maybe the person is thinking maybe the person is trying to remember something maybe they don't understand the question  keep quiet your intuition would be to explain the question don't do that just wait a few seconds and see what happens people will fill in the gaps  and finally don't ask for feedback this is another very popular thing up product developers do during interviews they describe the product or show up the product and then ask for feedback if you have the product asked people to use it even if you have a mark of it ask people to use it use a pencil and use it to sum it up here is a little exercise about leading questions I'm going to show you a few questions and let's talk about whether the leading on  first one  would you rather use the current version or this new improved one the word improved is a way for you to insert your opinion and biasing people into the answer that you're looking for  how does this compares to the way Netflix works now  now you're biasing people with their opinions about Netflix good bad you're biasing them into an answer that is not neutral trying to ask about the thing without comparing it to anything else  what did you think about that when you ask that you are forcing people to think about something they might not not have thought about if you didn't ask don't do that  would you click here to log in it's exactly as saying click here to log in this is an extremely biased question  what's wrong with this again inserting your thought that this is wrong and then expecting people to cooperate and say that it's wrong  here are three resources I recommend for learning more about how to ask questions a book an article and a video the book is called interviewing users by Steve particle the article is sixteen interviewing tips by Michael Margolis from Google ventures and the video is what people are really doing by I tease institute of design  here's a quick recap  look for the story  ask about behavior better yet asked to observe behavior  ask follow up questions extremely important  don't ask about the future  don't leave the witness and don't ask for feedback but do ask great questions thank you  \",\n",
       " \"hello everyone and welcome to envisions fourth design talk of twenty sixteen today we're talking with her name up you just Shanker engineer and entrepreneur behind stingy here about how

other links we discussed today so keep an eye on your inbox for that that's it for housekeeping without further ado I would like to present you poor Nina welcome let's start by you telling us a little bit about yourself  sure thanks everyone for joining me today and for those of you who aren't familiar with my background I actually got started have my second my second job was as the pounding engineer admin dot com and it was a great experience I was there from the very very beginning before we actually had a product and it was very fundamental in introducing me to design prior to that I really had little to no experience and had to quickly learn how to work with designers importance of design and also she is designed to really differentiate our product from what was out there in the market so I'll definitely be sharing a lot of my learnings from the experience with you today and I was basically there until the acquisition and then after the acquisition decide to strike out on my own and began building products like busy bee which is a CRM solution for fitness business sense I've also been a lecture I Duke University has most recently an entrepreneur in residence at five hundred start up  I'm during the time that I was working at meant I actually started walking on fan junior this was back in two thousand seven and I was writing my engineering entrepreneurship and around twenty thirteen I decided that I wanted to go from being a blog to a business and so today from junior is an education company and we help techniques such as yourselves build products and companies are level up in their careers  so I you know I know a number of you out there are already designers or your friend in engineers or know how to design some the goal of this at the weapon are today is not to teach you fundamentals of design or to talk about you know how to make pixel perfect designs you already know most likely got that covered what I really want to focus on is leveraging designed to differentiate so if you've already got design work that you've done or maybe there's a certain direction that you believe we should go in this is an opportunity for you to really take me out learning was that I'm giving you an item within a business contacts I know I've seen over and over again people come to me with amazing designs and you know there's always a business person that's like how does this relate so I'm I'm hoping that this will give you more ammo to deal with those conversations and so to that extent I'm gonna focus on our talking about product but I also want to talk about some of the other areas in which designers need to be involved and often aren't and it actually impacts product adoption and one of those key areas is definitely in marketing I'm in the same thing can be said about sales so I'll talk about how you want to get a little bit more involved on break down some of those marketing silos  and then the second thing I'll talk about is obviously evaluating a competitor's design but I want to say that to one of the end because I don't want you to get obsessed with what my gosh is what the competition is doing on but instead I want to show you how you can take the time to evaluate it and then position where product against what's already out there so that you appear stronger this is really critical especially if you are a start up or you're a growth phase I you're dealing with like an eight hundred pound gorilla I know really large company that's been around for a long time and has a lot of entrenched our branding and and people are just drawn to it because they might be the leaders in a particular category so it's a good idea to evaluate were designed versus bears and the position accordingly and then finally I'll give you a couple case studies to just drive the point home and and you can't you all the different things back a couple of these companies have done and hopefully that will teach you some lessons on what you can do and how you can actually make a big difference with your design regardless of what size you are what stage you are at your company  okay so let's start by talking a position in which I know is very different from design I'm back again when I was at an end I read this book and it was just very eye opening to me open to that point I had really read a lot about marketing I didn't really understand how to position products and how to build them but I didn't know what is going to take to differentiate so I read this book and one of my favorite quotes from the block because what our reasons basically saying is that you know as innovators we always feel like we need to build something new it needs to be cutting edge what really that's not what people want on what they want is to understand that there is a new spin on what already exists and then it's up to us to make the links so that people understand how this new thing is or better from the old thing and if we look at examples today in the market on all the products that exists today have been a new innovation Google was not the first search engine and the iPhone was not the first on mobile device so we know that there have been a lot of refinements and is this the smaller innovations that actually make a difference Black Rock people to understand how our product is different you know we have to bridge the gap we have to make those connections for them  so I'm gonna talk a little bit more about positioning on and then you bring it back into design so if you think about positioning there are basically five ways in which you can position product price is always what people start with because they are either going after and neglected customer segment needing a luxury or meeting  inexpensive product but I often tell people not to start with price because when you start with Christ actually into commoditizing your product so we're not going to focus on price but know that that is a tactic on the second is promotion now how do you get out there and talk about your product during you you grow marketing do you get out there and make you know infomercials how do you how do you actually promote your products is another technique I'm thirty distribution you know are you in a retail store are you online I'm so these are three techniques that you can use a what I'm gonna focus on obviously the last you can not competition how you position yourself versus the competitor as well as packaging and in our world design is basically catching  so I don't know how many of you out there are like need by if you grew up in the late nineties and early two thousands probably walked into something like a compu serve or passed by and you stop products like this on the shelf writings were what I like to call shrink wrapped software and what was interesting is you know there were just a few players because getting retail space is hot is difficult and it's also expensive and so what this why don't you wise clunky software and as a result you know these companies could just keep putting out in a small update every year we would go in and buy these products but we don't really have any say in terms of  the should be like better design it was just what's out there we buy it me I'm package it we install it on and then you probably remember that there were things like user manuals right open up a box it would be probably like a twenty page guide you have to read through to know how to install your product how you run it and you know how to use it so these were sort of older artifacts and what's been interesting is that  now that the model has changed you know we've gone from shrink wrapped software shoes socks models software as a service  we distribute software online it means that more people can distribute it and it also means that there's more competition and a lot of competition especially in the last five to ten years I've been around design and you see this not just in consumer products but they're also enterprise companies now that are realizing the importance of design and how usability is actually going to transform the way that their products get adopted and so what I always say is no there's there's more than one group that's demanding ease of use certainly there are that gets your millennials who have grown up with products like Facebook and Snapchat and demand that things be easy but there's also baby boomers have just gotten tired with those clunky shrink wrap solutions and they want something that's also push button the same damn time  so a lot of D.  need for design has come out of the demand for ease of use but that's actually not the primary I know a lot of conversation has been revolving around it there's been this rebirth in in design which is great but I would say there's actually something that's more important dandy ease of use and while this is important it should actually be on a secondary in terms of priorities and that's actually trust so when we think about trust what I mean by it is we're doing business online and we're no longer in a brick and mortar place where people can come up to ask ask questions or pick up the phone and how best to provide them support they really got it have a level of trust when they're using our product and so to that extent our eyes out position that we really have to think about how we're going to develop back  and part of the reason you know you might wonder like why is trust so important you know who cares if people don't like a product like move on right well the reason is risk right there's a lot of risk that people are taking when they purchase products or use products online I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with no element of fraud there's a lot of father goes on online on but there's also people who want to know that when they use your product their good experience away and that might be in their personal life or it might be in a business context and so anytime they're evaluating your product against competitors or against you know not even using the product they're wondering how is this going to impact either my bottom line or my personal security or you know is going to make me stand out  and so we've got to think about those elements as we are positioning our product  and the  again another great quote from one of the sales trainers and says the reason that we have to think about risk is because all people want to like sit down and look at your features and understand the benefits it's an emotional reaction that they're having and so for them risk is that emotional reaction and you have to be able to connect with them in order for them to be willing to take that risk and use your product  so this is become you know one my favorite mantras when it comes to designing any product that is going to be distributed online  whether it's you know software or something else and not you know repeat after me like I must build trust build trust they'll track you can never stop building trust on because it's basically how you retain users how to attract new ones and it's also how you keep people hooked in your products  so when I talk about trust a lot of times you will think okay well we just got it you know make everything secure war make everything look good and people will trust us right well I would argue that it actually is a lot more you really want to take a holistic view of building trust and this is where I think a lot of on the ammunition for designers high you can you can take this and use that in a business contacts because if you can explain to the stake holders that look you know in order for us to get that our adoption we have to have users trust us and they're going to understand that we're not going to be like no we don't want to do things in a chain right I'm so to that extent what it means is as the signers not just involved in product we were actually involved in the entire experience this comes back to that whole element of branding right so it's about the landing page when people come it's your front door so whatever your landing site is what is the experience they have there what is the information how does it look how can the interactive  and then the second phase is definitely a product phase if they've decided to sign up what does the onboarding look like and how can you give them a positive first time experience  and then the third is obviously ongoing experience so customer support teens know how are they responding what kind of  what boys are they using how are they navigating people through the product all of that is important and the final is providing that ongoing value so I would say you know as designers you wanna you wanna put your house on again and use design thinking to help with the whole experience and that I think is training that you uniquely have that you know engineers pianos and other people in the company may or may not have because no one group meeting focused only on like shipping another group are the focus on functionality on but as designers your goal is to bridge the gap between that the person who's actually using the product as well as you know how you make them feel in that experience  so the first thing I always tell people to start with is your landing page that's where you start to build your trust again it's that front door and so when people come to your landing site what did they get out of it  I am so part of that is you know it doesn't folks get really obsessed with conversion like what's our conversion what's our conversion and what they don't realize is that conversion basically comes down to not just you know what you say on your site bought the overall design of the aesthetic and house more that is to the product as well as the copy that they use you know their voice and their town and again this is where we can't just leave the work opt you are marketing team because a lot of times they can come to sales me or it can be this sort of thing where they just any tax the hell out of town  but they're not really developing a deep connection with the customers and so it's important to take the time to be involved in that process  and so we talk about a landing page you probably heard this over and over again so I realize I'm by like a hundred person that's hang this on but it's important that you list out the benefits of your product you know what is it that's going to do what's the value that it's delivering and not the features again seen a lot of times when marketers are given free rein it always comes down to like  what we have X. Y. and Z. feature and then it's a it's a matter check boxes verses and the competitors but we should take the time to actually define the benefits it creates a clearer picture in terms of what the end user is going to experience rather than  you know they're missing this like one particular feature  and the second is in the area of security and privacy and this is so often overlooked and it's amazing  people feel like  you know we have the second version what does what the security and privacy matter I would say it actually matters a lot especially depending on the type of product you're creating your doing anything if it's in the financial services healthcare social networks are I would say people really want to know that there are some level of community moderation or some level of privacy in terms of you know your own on detached and that things are gonna be Capstick your and I always see these convoluted no security and privacy plates and pages that I don't know who they're intended it I know it's just legal means by I don't know who they're intended to make feel better so it's important to take the time to explain know how your product and how you as a company value people's security and privacy  think about who is going to use your product and explain more about what I need by that on  is really what I'm getting at is it's important to give people a sense of who your customers already are so you can attract other customers that are like that  in the final I hear a lot of you know when when you are designing landing sites many pages there always concerned back out appealing to multiples personas and what I would say is it's not actually about multiple personas it's about who is the decision maker and if there are multiple decision makers and you need to make sure that there's enough information to address their concerns  so let's start by talking about the value proposition right this is again where we want to focus on benefits and not the features and so what that means is what's the first time experience going to be like when the customer uses the product you know what's the win button can give back  so here's an example of you know Airbnb friend in page and you see here that you're very clearly I'm coming to this site for the very first time the wind that I'm gonna experience is having a comfortable bad in a place that feels like home and if I don't experience that I'm probably gonna write a bad review if I experienced that heck I'm gonna read also review I'm gonna tell my friends about it and no word is gonna spread right so it's important to give back element that emotional first time experience in the landing page so you you see here it's not things like  you know can I book a place in Hawaii or you know how to their team at work or you know it doesn't get into all the nitty gritty details are really just pulling in with me first hand experience  now you probably so yeah I saw here from people saying like what about teachers not so important right they're gonna ask us questions they want to know we have all these bells and whistles  and what I would say is having something very high level is good certain how the how it works section with just two or three or just a few few ways in which your product works then that's enough when you get into the nitty gritty of features that's where again war product gets compared to other competitors products it's also where people get tripped up is asking you one thousand one questions you know they get really into the minutia and at some point you know they'd lose focus of why they were there looking at your product and looking at your landing site  so here's a great example but I took from calling me and how many will use callin me on it's basically a way to soccer schedule and what ball easily Bach and I just love the simplicity of this because they're not sitting here telling you out here all the features we offer you know integration and we do this and they're just saying what you start by setting your preferences and use another link and then people can at themselves and they've basically taken away all of any new shot and kept it really high level so that people just have a sense of okay I see how this works you know maybe I have some more questions you know go to the faqs page but from a high level I understand that the point of this product is to helping with scheduling and to kind of get rid of that back and forth when I'm having a schedule with somebody else  so we will call this a lot word of mouth is really really powerful and it's very hard though as an online  product or in as fast product to get that word of mouth going despite what we silent despite having Twitter and Facebook and all the social media  it's still hard because it comes back to that element of trust right people aren't necessarily going to believe everybody online they want to know that  they're actually been successful customers have used your product and so when it comes to a word of mouth testimonials can be pretty powerful what what I often times is testimonial that either don't really make sense or don't really cap sure who the end user is an art relatable so whoever you take a testimonial from make sure that that user is representative of the type of users that you want to continue to interact with no other people that you want to convert into customers and so to that extent we're gonna make sure that there is an element of relating on and it's almost it does kind of funny like saying you know any downturn that people will see that this is realistic  so here's a great example but I talk from skill crash you'll see here about Charlotte Baker you know went through their program and she's you know she's using her own words and she says stuff like I'm not exaggerating when I say skill crash changed my life and so I was somebody who is reading this I'm gonna think  I wonder how it changed her life okay well it looks like wow she was fired from a job she hated you know how many of us never had that experience I know about you but I certainly happy right this is a lot more believable on because I'm seeing this through the lens of Charlotte Baker this isn't just a company Tooting their own horn and if I want I can go on to win the war of Charlotte story but this is a great way for me to say wow this customer is just like me or my friends and it becomes a lot more relatable so this is another way can build trust on war manning site  here's another example arms companies called home care and they provide a home care assistance to the elderly again that's an industry where people really care about trust right if they're going to be having somebody come into their homes if they're going to be having them take care of their parents or family members then trust is really important and again even the imagery that they use know that looks like somebody's parent not  right and so again it pulls  and help them understand wow okay there are people who are getting assistance here and what I like about this is even the subtle team in terms of like aside the fun thing use it's pretty bank I'm not because most of the people who are signing up for elderly care are going to be the children or again the loved ones  you might also be in the middle age so it seems kind of silly but no the bigger font is actually helpful  they're also addressing the major concerns that customers have your pricing like exceptional home care is in town on eight you know go ahead and call up trust on and they talk about how valuable it is to have these people come to your home  now let's talk about the topic of multiple personas because a lot of times when people come to your landing page landing site they might have many different personas so how do you address all of those and pull them into your product  well again like I said you really want to start by thinking about how to design for the decision maker and not Michael multiple people but you want to think about it in terms of concerns  and so here's an example that I took from straight on they basically had the payment gateway for people to use it there are creating their sass products are mobile products and your number of your pretty familiar with them  what you'll notice here is given their copy they say like design of the whole company night so they know that as a payment provider they're actually impacting a lot of people in organization it's not just engineering also finance probably security and public customer support and they've taken the time to address all the concerns that each one of these groups how they talk about how they have awaits you on your provide font protection provide accounting integrations on and make it pretty push button to set up if you are the engineering team so they haven't really called out Hey if you're an engineer here click here if your finance click here but instead they realize that there's gonna be multiple people coming and looking at their site so they need to address all of their concerns because there's multiple makers  yeah same thing here with home care assistance again thank sample used before again here you've noticed they're taking a lot of time to address concerns on and they know that there's been a lot of decisions involved and so what they've done is they've said no basically white white shoes home care on and they've talked about being a trusted partner talked about how they work through cognitive therapeutics on the talk about how available they are and again these are all concerns that people have when they when they're thinking about okay should I invite somebody in to take care of my elderly relative  now we talked a lot about the winning site so hopefully that gives you a sense of the things that you need to work on and how you want to work with the marketing team  shift gears now talk about product so that first time experience so assuming that you know your landing site was great got somebody to convert they signed up how are you then going to give them a positive first hand experience to get them hooked  so I would say you know the purpose of the landing site was you made a promise to the user inside sign up and the benefits that will touted on our landing site are gonna be the benefits that you experience in the product and so you want to make sure if you actually taking the time to  make that make it make the parallel because a lot of times this is where the disconnect happens they go to a landing site if you like also amazing and then when nobody converts Norman either sign up but they don't actually come paying members are scratching your head  and this is why we have to break down the silo between marketing and sales as as well as product in our lives designers on is because that's what happens you don't see the increase conversion don't see people paying for the product upgrading because they feel like they were told one thing and experience something out so that promise that you made on the landing site needs to be carried through  and so one of the ways to do that actually depending on what stage you're at is to get the customer to a win and get them to that positive first hand experience and determine what that positive first time experience is for that  and sometimes it can be as simple as like giving them something on I want to give you an example here of this company called pronoun   familiar with them but basically what they're doing is they're making it so that self published authors highways to sell their box on an inner providing a platform and they haven't watched yet so what was interesting is they were just building up their email last and they wanted to have something to give away and how to create that first time experiencing quite a little bit of word of mouth and so for those of you who you know may have self published you know that you have to have an ISBN number for your book to sell it on things like Amazon or wherever else can cost about a hundred hundred fifty Bucks on what what they decided to do was they decided no give our customers a first time win let's give them something and so when you sign up they basically giving you an ISBN number so you don't have to necessarily be no deep into the product it can just be a delight for first time experience  I'm actually one of my favorite quotes from Maria jeans he's been your experience on our desk now she says it's not about that minimum  viable product it's what's the most minimum delightful product you can go out and so if that is something very simple not that's fine as long as it's going to delight your users  and to bring up example with me and I remember in the early days one of the most delightful experiences that people would have was just getting their weekly summary email or walking in and seeing all their accounts no they didn't need all the bells and whistles they were just happy they were able to connect to their bank account or credit card account and we were all their money went you know it whether they had money or not remember in dad or the you know it didn't really matter they just wanted to have that visibility and that was a really powerful experience for that in fact I still hear from some people that say you know I just look at my weekly summary and act like good enough for me I'm so it doesn't have to be this complicated Senate leaders there can be a lot of value in just a very simple first time experience as long as it's clear and obvious well designed  there's obviously going to be times and you mind experiencing this now or you might experience before where you know people for whatever reason decide that the product is it for them and they just want to leave I'm not okay because a lot of times it might be that they were expecting more it might be a mainstream customer not early adopter on or they might just decide you know now is not the time on just out of new product and Big Brother into something else so you got a first take the time to understand why they leave and this is why it's important to now connect with customer support because they're going to be the folks on your team we're gonna have the the most you know emails in terms of like cancellations stop right so you get a sense of why people are leaving and use that and then you know redesign your product resent your features are redesign your landing site and then use that information to hold them back in  so what I'll I'll tell people is it doesn't matter you know if you had customers who sign up six months ago or six years ago or whatever if you have been updating and improving our product is very important that you are sending out your yard updates I know everybody there is our our hands in the air and they're like oh my gosh we send out people unsubscribe you know it's like that's fine that's just the nature of the business but it's not telling them the improvements you've made it he's not telling them that you addressed their concerns and  then and now you will build what they had asked for then you're missing out on an opportunity to get all those people to a doctor product so it's important is down again with your marketing team and make sure it back when you are keeping you are inactive customers are people who canceled are aware of the work that you're doing  okay so now we get to the part about competition and are giving you a lot of information here on just the element of trust building but there is really important to talk about that before we get into the competition space on because I wanted you to focus more on the things that you have control over and what you can do before you focus too much on with a competitor's doing so now let's talk about how to actually sit down and critique the competition and you know I give you this information not because you should then do it apples to oranges comparison and be like we're so much better than them but instead she uses it as a way to portray the benefits that you offer you don't have to offer in terms of contrast and then it can just be what you offer on and a lot of times customers will pick up on this on these cues and realize no who they want to use like this product one use  so the first thing is how long does it take to set up  it doesn't matter if it's a beauty product for consumer product that is always an issue for people aren't especially for consumers right they have very very little patience and so taking the time to figure out how you can at how your competitors products either push button or it's not can be really valuable if you can make your is very simple to set up then chances are you are going to adopt your prop person bears the second is you know I was there following the steps in the first time  have it easy or is it really complicated and throwing them off  and then again coming back to the competition on is their first time interaction dot in parallel with the benefits they talk about on the landing page is a lot of times  competitors will see this over and over again and I see this morning to be to be space where they'll have all these amazing  you know reviews and they'll talk about how wonderful their product is and then when you get into the product it's clunky it takes forever to set up or there is like a really lengthy sales process or there's a contract that you have to sign and those are all things that people don't want to do but they might have just been allowed by the landing site right  so it's important to make sure that they're actually in parallel and if they're not it's a great leverage point for you to compete against online  and the last is confusion right there's always things in a product that people find confusing and it can be a point of frustration if it continues and so what are those frustrating thing was that you can avoid doing or you can provide a more delightful experience with your product and that's also what gets people to switch away from whatever product you're using today if they know it's going to be a much more delightful experience  all right now I mean any couple case studies Robison's heart with an instant  my background and I wanna explain to you how you know we thought about our adoption because for us we certainly didn't entrenching mark get as you know of a prime member there were definitely a number of incumbents in the space already and he had a number of competitors was tabi was another start up who actually launched about a year before us on quicken which was Microsoft on site which was into its product was also on the market and Microsoft money on was another product and they were getting ready to end of life their product and so when we when we started to build manage what we quickly aren't realized why is that with money they actually because they were and wiping their product not left a hole in the market for all these PC users with quick can benefit was that again never shrink wrapped and it will only servicing PC users they had actually and a wife there mac product so it meant that if we could build something for mac users we would get a portion of that market was sunny and they were really focused and more online community building and in fact they're set up was really clunky at required you to like download these files from your bank and then upload them and we were just like you know we don't think it's a good experience and so we were aware of our competitor's product but we didn't sit there and say like  we're so much better than the other guys we just took it as a sense of okay this is what they're doing that we think is not quite right and we can provide a more holistic experience that's going to be positive  to that extent again we start off by building trust we work financial services product we're twenty somethings living in Silicon Valley was gonna trust twenty somethings with their bank information right and so is really really important to us that we took the time to build as much trust as we call it on the landing site and so we talked about things like bank level security I'm I don't know why people just trust banks despite all the stuff that happened throughout history and so we had to draw that parallel the other was that we invested in automation so we need our product push button as possible none of these like downloading files uploading it importing we just made it so that it worked and that people didn't have to worry about the set up process out on your first hand experience  the third was you know with in the product itself like I said we start with the landing page we want to make sure that the design was coherent and so we didn't want to have a pretty landing page grilling site and then  a product it was like so so honestly major the design was consistent and that the workload kind of we have for a trust  now here's another company called a lark and for those of you who may or may not be familiar Ozark does live chat and what's interesting is again they were in a very competitive space you know there's a lot of live chat companies out there today on that provide that customer support widget commerce sites or your websites in general and so again they were thinking of it with the element of experience they were thinking how can we provide a better first time experience for our customers compared to what's on the market already and so as they didn't go into their space they realized a couple things first what they realize is a lot of the competitors it takes a long time to connect for whatever reason it just takes a long time to connect to their like support which I'm it's also really hard to scale operators and young multiple customer support people using the product on it just gets a little bit bogged down something was very slow and then some products actually required the customer to download stuff just to like connected customer support well how annoying is great  and then there is the element of just trust and you know where you can find the customer support like you have to go and look for the contact agents always buried in and they just made it so that it sits on a portion of the website and it can be on every page so whenever people want to be able to connect with the company you can just type into the chat box  so they started off by realizing the importance was getting customers and the main set up a simple as possible they basically gave their customers three lines of code and they were like you don't need to know how to code no just cut and paste and here's how you do it and it and it actually lead to more adoption on the second thing is if you look at it you know it it looks like she'll check Anthony will might be like on a rooftop G. track  but really what they did was they use a familiar product a familiar design winnings familiarity it actually builds credibility right people believe in global they believe that they don't do any no evil  and so who better to you sort of mock than using Google art so that's that was actually designed on purpose  and then you'll notice at the bottom they actually put a link that says you know free  lark life how will this actually helped with adoption it was baked in branding so the companies that would adopt their product and put them on their website they would if they decided to not  pay for the upgrade they would basically be like free advertising so anytime a customer one of their customers came in with the  arc and then they'd be like oh that's cool I and a lot of times  they were also started people or our online on  as owners and so they would start to adopt them as well and the final was connecting with an operator quickly so when you're there there's just you state your operator has to be there or you have to say are off line there's no in between a state of like waiting for ten minutes to connect with somebody yeah that's that's very frustrating experience and they don't want that affiliation so they want to make sure that the whole experience  for the end user and it may not be their customer is a positive one  okay so that basically wraps up when I wanted to talk about today and I wanna make sure I get you guys plenty of time on but in case you want more I've got a book called how to transfer ideas in this offer products back and giving out on about five hundred copies of the the first five hundred people from this weapon are you want to get it and there's a link here and since Margaret sending out the slides you will also get a link in your in box sold when I write it down and get it right now you can are going to wait until just about five that's fine tale  and then if you want even more I've got and of course coming up called ship it and it's basically going from idea to obtain prototype walking through the entire process and myself and actually a couple other designers David Catanese Jerry duty on actually to check with you all online and it's lives you get a lot of experience interacting with us and other students if you're interested you can check it out at engineer dot com slash a bit applications are actually you by the end of the week and we have a info session coming up this evening at six PM PST spell check out if you're interested  all right with that I will take it over to you Margaret awesome thank you so much so in just a moment pretty more answer questions from you guys so I encourage you to either use Twitter with the hash tag envision weapon are to ask then but also feel free to use that go to weapon our question portal to submit and if you prefer I'm so I also want to note I know a few people had some trouble getting in today we did do a full recording of this and it'll be up on our blog and either tomorrow or the day after we're gonna get that up for you quickly and just in case you missed any part of it so while we wait for some of those questions to come in want to launch a quick hold I'm and this is for those of you who are currently collaborating with six or more people in your design process we have it envisions enterprise platform is specifically designed for teens like yours so it has some really powerful features that are included in our street team our professional plans that can enable your team to position your product through design and I know are a mixed bag of folks on the call someone a spare you the details of those features if you are interested though in trying out a free trial of that enterprise platform and all those features with your team just indicate so on the survey and I'm gonna have any reach out to you to help you get set up and okay so let me keep out pull up for a few minutes while we start answering some questions  what   a bunch people are asking for that you are out for the book again so sorry let me yeah I know I know downloading it already  okay  wanted to pull it up I can yeah I'll go back you got a minute closed up in right at  yeah make sure that our invasion and so that you get it for free download free  let me  all right and so Luciano had a question and he said how do you create a great landing page when there aren't just multiple personas but multiple decision makers struggling to simplify to simply articulate all the benefits and glaive give that clear CTA's for three very different types of users all on one page  yeah well I think that's a good question because this comes up a lot and I would again say it's it's about the concerns like people might have different concerns and you want to be able to address all the concerns on that one page so even if there are multiple groups coming on and you have a sense of what their concerns are you can list them out in terms of CGA I always recommend keeping it as simple as possible not the end of the day you want people to DO one maybe two things one either sign up immediately or you know give you their contact info is that you can get in touch with them if you will get more complicated than not and try to be like what you're like this person do this and then this person that it throws people off and then they're like oh well maybe I should like go talk to Bob in accounting and like get him to sign off on this and ask him to sign up right it it just it it creates too much friction so making it as simple as possible shoot collector it like there  contact information and get them using the product is important so boil the CGA down to like one one thing needing to  but beyond that you don't want to create K.  if you are concerned you know I hear this a lot  that like well there's really a lot of decision makers and you just want to create a landing page her persona that's the other way to go and so you can design it at that if you're allergic to one very very specific persona you can make it start with that  you know whatever I'm worried or whatever you know will search they're doing or however they're coming to your change is tied back to it on so that the search terms merit that change and not when you can have a very custom experience her persona so in the event that you don't want to mix them all up into one one site  when page we can Christine back but I would not recommend you know again one thing at all and in having all sorts seeking  great advice and so he air said how did you test at mid to insure the best you axe and see axe  works customer experience okay thanks art let's get I want something if we get back  so we are we're pretty strict about not wasting time in coming up with like a multiple iterations and any testing and all that stuff one because we're pretty small team  but you we also felt like we should put something out there and then we had already had a pretty engaged can many of people telling us yes or no on and then quite frankly a lot of it came down to measuring engagement analytics so I remember we had and I had built a helpful this feature called are like fitness and we spent over  couple weeks designing this thing I kind of have this gut instinct and it was getting really complicated but at the end of the day works like ship it might seem quite frankly nobody liked it and we look at the numbers it looks terrible you know we even had people coming to our blogger coming to customer support telling us like what is this thing like we don't understand it at all so we had to take the time to say okay a lot of people confused instead of continuing to put out there cause more confusion what's actually rip it out and we ended up  just ripping out all together redirecting it so that we can act actually you only worked on and then taking the time to think through how we wanted it to to go based on some of the feedback that we received on but it was important it is kind of get something quick and dirty out there first and then get some of that negative at and I don't know if there was any politicking back in some cases there were positive feedback on but it was those faster innovation cycles that were more valuable than doing multiple iterations and then showing people okay we want a virgin or be version I can be really costly when you have a small team so that's how we   we kept up with the user experience and how we generated on we also kept pretty good ties in terms of what people were using a lot and that's where we like I said the weekly summary email we noticed we had such a high open rate in fact people who are opening it we're not coming back to the product and I became an issue for us because we're like but we really have like more stuff in the product right so we started to keep a close watch on on this you know court in this  correlated behavior of what was unthinkable were using and then you know what were they not using and we did the same thing with mobile I'm gonna say we kept a really really close connection between engineering and customer support because we weren't getting a lot of acting back out this works this doesn't I and we needed to hear that back again in order to enter right so the more you can break down the silos and work with the customer support team on the more likely you are to actually give customers or what they're what they're asking for it and understand what they're getting  that's that's I think that's really important like you said and and I think that's an interesting relationship that needs to happen within a company is definitely engineering and support me to be kind of the best best friends and so dom is asked to build iOS app was it in house team or vendor and how did you choose the technology to build apps  so this was way back in the very beginning  when I phone first came out and I can you an idea of why we chose iOS and we also had to build it in house  because literally like I think this was two thousand seven when on the first agenda came out and we need to develop some connections apple and they said if you build your app really quickly and it's you know well cast said we will have a blue devil act in our store and we were thinking after amazing distribution channel for us  and so we did not have things like swift we had to learn objective scene and build that will build I'm a native apps  and that meant that we had a completely separate code bases but it went into the main code base in terms of  you're creating a P. eyes that we get all the data out are but we did it pretty much everything in house I would not recommend I'm going forward because again it's  were small team and so our resources became very very strapped quickly and at some point me on while we're supporting the webapp  one of our engineers who was also supporting a rap basically had to stop and focus on the tension on mobile and a couple other engineers also how to do that so we did not like think about it we were just thinking about it in terms of  this is a great distribution channel let's give it a shot  and because it was at the era were mobile was just getting started there were a lot of lessons like that that we had to learn on going forward you know I I might consider using an outsourced agency who knows a better or just using a platform where you can distribute across a couple on android and iOS depending on how big of an apple happened what the music just like for your customers rather than going you know doubling down just like one one  San and I know you touched on this a little bit before about can all asked what are your thoughts on eighty testing  entire or part of the landing page  yeah well I will say this overall in terms of any testing on there is no point any testing if you are just getting started so if your start up with very few users and my very few I mean less than ten thousand  there's really no point in eighty testing because it's not gonna be as statistically significant as you think and quite frankly again you're gonna be spending a lot of time buildings to in our rations are in building like the subtle nuances and then trying to make sense of it are and what works better is actually putting one of the first generation out getting customer feedback whether it's positive or negative and then doing aeration after bigger company or let's say you've got ten thousand plus users and you decide okay now the one in the task the landing page on then I think it's it's fair but you really got to have a sense of what are you testing like what is it that you're trying to improve I'm I know a lot of people get so caught up in minutia they're like let's move this button to the left versus the right unless you know what he was  slightly different copy on the thing you have to have a deeper understanding of what's the value proposition that we're casting and do we need to change back in each iteration so that people will more likely convert and sign up for the product times you want to have that kind of thinking going in other ways again you're wasting a lot of time on the spinning your wheels and and building things that may or may not actually providing statistical significance  I I think those are great tips I know everyone's trying to become more data focused as their building and make better smarter decisions but as you said I think sometimes it's just  not statistically significant my sister is shot my sister getting her PhD in statistics and sometimes she just makes are crazy so I'll I'll say about data is it doesn't tell us the why you know it tells us like some information tells why people aren't doing certain things or they are doing certain things and so that's where a customer support I am really engaging with your users is valuable because they will give you the full story on my second product that I built with busy bee I remember we would have people show up use the product leave and come back like every two weeks and I finally got frustrated because the data wasn't giving us any sort of indication so I just call them up and I was like why do you like user product for like a two week stretch and then not use it out and a lot of these people were just getting started in their business they were just setting up their studio so they would say  you know  I tax right now and then I got busy and I gave it to my business manager and they try it out and then they got busy until we realized the speaking here what's going on with all these  business in that we're just starting out that we had to change the experience I'm not going to change the rate that we measured how they were using a product because of that  San Andreas said you have some tips for better automation  I am not sure I understand like when you're trying to automate good question injury appears on the line why don't you give us a little bit more detail on on your automation issues  Austin free said did you have any books that you would recommend to someone who wants to become more first and user experience design  yeah I I think don't make me think is great  I also read the design of everyday things  I also love the laws of simplicity those are I think three I can go to box that anybody who's either interesting experience nine or you know working with designers or whatever  because it just gives you a good holistic view of how you should think about the overall experience and then  shot out to one of my instructors are doing she has it will green on user experience notebook that she puts out with a lot of great links and a lot of it's very relevant and timely and she does expiration of different  lose your design experience topics so check her out at me dot com  San Andreas said if you're just starting out  launching to maybe less than a hundred users what's the best way to get that customer feedback  it sounds like if there is a if it's if it's less than a hundred  I actually just love getting them on the phone or and getting them to if at all possible like sit down and you were usability test with you because you learn so much by being as close to present as possible I'm rather than a surveying which you know Michael designed in a way that's financed or you don't know when they're filling it out or if they're telling you like the full information so it's gonna be a lot more candidates in a lot more valuable and if it's less than a hundred and you know distributed amongst your team and have each person take maybe a handful of the customers and collect the thing back but you want them to be using their own words as you get bigger you know as you get to the hundred plus then it's okay to collect on going back through surveys but you really want to make sure that you take some amount of time to establish more that personal connection is also going to be users that you can go back to you as you in array and say okay I mean we did what you said and we made these changes now tell us what you think ons you always want to have some of those people income constantly go back to and we'll provide you that valuable  yeah there's nothing like a phone call  so hair said another what question from there how do you make sure the experiences same on all devices the apple watch desktop extenders you have any tips on making sure that it's consistent  that's that's a challenge and I would say that's actually something to then think about you know why do you want to distribute on all these different platforms on because it is it is very difficult especially if you are we using a code base persons building  you know a native apps on each of these devices if you use the native app and you can get into all the nitty gritty details and design it specifically for that device and make sure it's a really rich experience but if you're you're doing something like phone gap or any other on  frameworks that you use the experience is going to be different and so it's up to you on to decide how you want that I would actually say  this is where you want to take the time to decide where are the majority of your users and focus on just one or two devices rather than trying to design for every single experience unless you have a really big company with a big budget you know lots of resources at your disposal on because it is going to be in that sort of thing where you want to have as close to an experience that's consistent as possible on but you still respect  like particulars of the device right especially as it's like Starbucks where whichever Starbucks you go to in the world you're always going to get the same like experience the same products but they might be designed to like each copy house maybe design a little bit differently to  relate to like a local flair and to the can you get there and so that's how you want to think about it don't assume that you're gonna be able to give the exact same experience on every single device  nice and conversely Olea said how do you feel about those landing pages that all look the same due to the similar sections with benefits testimonials X. setter I do you have an opinion on kind of that maybe two consisting of design across all products  no that's okay I think a lot of times we feel like  with Klay Shane attacked me but it comes back to that point of familiarity and if people can move through your landing site understand what page for on on understands that it's similar to maybe some other like well designed sites on then they're gonna get information that they need and they're gonna want to use your product it's when you try to be two different  or you know this is why I like a lot of times people hate going to flash lights because they're like oh wait now like ten seconds this thing to load up I could they just designed a simple HTML page right I'd like to try to get to a clever we try to write you a letter of experience that people start to drop box so you know there is nothing wrong in providing a level of consistency a level of familiarity that people have become accustomed jails onto don't don't just missed that and I would say it what's what you can do to make it a lot more personal is is the branding is is your voice as the way that you create the aesthetics around it so there's room to play in space  perfect and  so Eric asked how do you recommend finding the right balance between focusing on improving onboarding and communication or building new features to quote unquote delight users  yeah that's a great question and I know it's it's a challenge in any organization and I always like to push back to the business folks and ask them what's important you want to fix a leaky bucket or do you mean you want you know bring in new users and what I mean by that is if you have a leaky bucket right people are reading your product as no point in creating new features we really want to focus on onboarding keeping the people who are coming if instead you wanna tracking new users you know you don't care about the only about get then maybe building a new set of features that appeals to them it should be your focus on  I did you both it can be a challenge again unless you have a really big toll on by I would say it comes down to like one or that one of the metrics for the business what are they trying to do and often times on the way I've structured it in the past is there will be some iterations likes on sprint's where we just focus on the metric around you keeping user is getting getting changed anything and other iteration or another quarter and we decide okay we kind of got that down to you not as close to a science as we'd like but it's it's getting there now we can switch our attention which you were building out new features on but I think if we try to just building  aren't working with forgetting that looking back I felt you know throw back at them and say like what's important and when you do that it again grace that I already which they understand and it makes your life a lot easier to because you're not trying to do too much  St I'm Jeremih is asking   let's see what's your thoughts and opinions on using a motion  sorry emoticons within an app or website to communicate candid information  three four emoticons or against about what a con I think you know I get a tear person can come back the persona on so if your customers feel like it and professional or they don't personally use it I wouldn't  right if they are the type that you then it can be very engaging like certainly product time guys love them no jeans fit in there email subject lines and all over the site  you know it's really Amazon does not you know Jeez I'm considered right customer base in someone because my face but just different kind of personality so it's up to you to play with your personality but also understand who it's going to attract and who it's going to put on and take the time to test that out  and so I think we have time for  I'm one more question because I know we're running a little bit over I'm so can all ask what are  your top five best design products that you use in your opinion and he gave three of his opinions and he is being very  loving and said envision square an intercom our history favorites but he wants to know your five best design products you use  well I would definitely agree with you on square I don't webapp but certainly the  the mobile app and the card reader are pretty well designed  you know let's see I've got a minute sheet and put my iPhone I can look through the product  I'm here to tell you are actually quite frankly Instagram you know it's that simple to use and they even though they keep adding  interest to it you don't really notice so it's I would say on the on the role of simplicity I'm for kind of a bigger product I actually would say   that  Indy is you know obviously pretty well designed I use it quite a lot as a traveler so I like it there things that are quirkier than others  that I haven't liked but given what it's trying to do I think it's definitely pretty well designed I'm I also went slack no again really push button products simple to use on that  for payments another payment product I like to use them because it's again pretty simple couple experience issues how do you feel about the fact that you have to write something in the band now  thank thank you have to give it a rest   I don't about that I I was in my concern was like when I had to transfer to the bank I  was kind of like how do I do it it took a couple steps student there so that was that it was a little bit of a challenge but  but I think somewhere to square it's it's good for our payments aren't certainly a lot more like simple to send you money Kansai like back I think one of my I work three or four are I have like one more that I have to  we'll talk about   I think  let me see  as  our  SO is found another messaging apps I would say is actually what's happened I think again really simple simple design   and I think that's it thank you I think you have your five you actually even given six honestly  yeah I just think it always comes down to like one of my using on a daily basis and  you know what the big things are like messaging transacting that sort of stuff so yeah I think that covers one the like and then I I like I said I like the one and I like  like to I think they're really well designed and use them a lot too  fantastic so pretty much thank you so much for chatting with us today and for really great talk and a big thank you also to those who attended today I hope you have a great rest of your day and keep designing awesome things  \",\n",
       " \"in the great nineteen eighties movie the blues brothers there's a scene where John Belushi  goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment in Chicago for the very first time it's a cramp tiny space and it's just three feet away from the train tracks  as Johnson Sundance bad a train goes rushing by rattling everything in the room  John asks how often does the train go by  Dan replies so often you won't even notice it and then if something falls off the wall  we all know what he's talking about as human beings we get used to everyday things really fast  as a product designer it's my job to see those everyday things to feel them and try to improve upon the  for example  see this piece of fruit  see this little sticker  that's the car wasn't there when I was a kid  but somewhere as the years passed someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit why so can be easier for us to check out at the grocery cart  well that's great we can get in out of the store quickly  but now there's a new problem  we get home and we're hungry and we see this for right juicy piece of fruit on the counter which one to pick it up any  except now we have to look  for this little sticker  and do you get it with our nails damaging the flash  then rolling up that sticker you know what I mean and then trying to flick it off your fingers  right  it's not fun  not at all  but something interesting happened  see the first time you did it you probably felt those feelings you just want to eat the piece of fruit but it was you get you felt upset you just want to dive in  by the tenth time you start to become less less upset he started to just do that peeling the label off by the hundred time at least for me I became numb to it I simply picked up the piece of fruit  Doug gather with my nails trying to flick it off  and then wonder was there another sticker  so why is that why do we get use everyday things was human beings we have limited brain power  so our brains in Cody everyday things we do into habits  so we can free up space to learn new things  it's a process called a bit too ation and it's one of the most basic ways as humans we learn  no appreciation is always bad  remember learning to drive  I sure do  your hands clinched the ten into on the wheel  looking at every single object out there the cars the lights the pedestrians is a nerve wracking experience  so much so that I couldn't even talk to anyone else in the car  our and I couldn't even listen to music  but then something interesting happened as the weeks went by  driving became easier and easier  you have **** waited at  it started become finding second nature  man you could talk to your friends again listen to music so there's a good reason why our brains to be two eight things if we didn't we notice every little detail all the time  it would be exhausting and we have no time to learn about new things  but sometimes the beach where she is in good  if it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us well that's bad  and if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems well then that's really bad  comedians know all about this Jerry Seinfeld entire career was built I noticed in those little details those idiotic things we do every day that we don't even remember  he tells us about the time he visited his friends and he just wanted to take a comfortable shower he reach out and grab the handle and turned it slightly one way it was a hundred degrees too hot  and then he turned the other way and it was a hundred degrees to call he just wanted a comfortable shower now we've all been there  we just don't remember it but Jerry did and that's the comedians job but designers innovators and entrepreneurs it's our job to not just noticed those things but to go one step further and try to fix them  see this this person this is merry Anderson  in nineteen oh two in New York  she was visiting  it was a cold wet snowy day and she was warm inside a street car  as she was going to our destination she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off  the the access now so we can drive safely  when you open the window though he let all this cold wet air inside making all the passengers miserable  now probably most of those passengers just thought it's a fact of life he's got open the window to clean it that's just how it is  but Mary didn't  I thought  what is the driver could actually clean the windshield from the inside so that he can stay safe and drive and the passengers can actually stay warm  so she picked out her sketchbook right then and there and begin drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper  no it's a product designer I try to learn from people like merry  try to see the world the way it really is  not the way we think it is  why because it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees  but it's hard to solve the problem that almost no one sees  now some people think you're born with disability or you're not  as if Mary Anderson was hard wired at birth to see the world more clearly  that wasn't the case for me I had to work at  during my years at apple  the job challenge this  to come in to work every day  to see  our products through the eyes of the customer the new customer the one that has fears and possible frustrations  and hopefully exhilaration that the new technology product to work straight away from them  he called it staying beginnings and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster easier and seamless for the new customers  so I remember this clearly in the very early stages of the I pod  see back in the nineties being a gadget freak like I am  I would rush out to the store  for the very very latest gadgets  I take all the time to get to the store I check out I come back home I'd start time boxes and then there was another little sticker the one that said charged before use what  I can't believe it I just spent all this time buying this product and now I have to charge me for you so I have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that cover the new toy was crazy but you know what almost every product back then did that when it had batteries and you had to charge before used  well Steve noticed that  any said we're not gonna let that happen to our product  so what do we do  typically when you have a product that has a hard drive in it you wanted for about thirty minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive is going to be working years later for the customer after they played on the box  what do we do instead  we ran that product for over two hours  why well first off we can make a higher quality product be easy to test and make sure it was great for the customer  but most importantly the battery came fully charged right out of the box ready to use so that customer just  with all that that exhilaration could just start using the product it was great and it worked people like that now today almost every product then you get that battery power comes out of the box fully charged even if it doesn't have a hard drive  but back then we noticed that that detail and we fixed it I know everyone else does that as well no more charged before use  so why am I telling you this  well it's seeing the invisible problem not just the obvious problem  that's important  not just for product design but for everything we do you see their invisible problems all around us ones we can solve  so first we need to see them to feel that  so I'm hesitant to give you any tips about neuroscience and psychology there's far too many experienced people the tech community will know much more about that than I ever will  let me leave you with a few tips that I do and we all can do  to fight him be tuition  my first tip is to look broader  you see when you're tackling a problem sometimes there are a lot of steps that lead up to the problem and sometimes a lot of steps after  if you can take a step back and look broader maybe you can change some of those boxes before  problem maybe you can combine them maybe can remove them all together to make that better  take thermostats for instance in the nineteen hundreds when they first came out you really simple to use your term up or turn them down people understood them  but in the nineteen seventies the energy crisis struck and customer started thinking about how to save energy  so what happened thermostat designers decided to add a new step in so just trying up and down you know how to program she could tell the temperature you wanted a certain time  now that seem great  every thermostat it started adding that feature  but it turned out  no one saved any energy  now why is that  couldn't predict the future they just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season year to year  so no one was saving energy and what happened thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that program instead  they made better you ice  they may better documentation  it's still years later people were not saving any energy  because they just couldn't predict the future  so what do we do  put a machine learning algorithms instead of the program that would simply watch when you turned it up and down what would you like to certain temperature when you got up or when you went away and you know what it worked people are saving energy without any programming  so it doesn't matter what you're doing if you take a step back and look at all the boxes  maybe there's a way to remove one or combined  we can make that process much simpler  so that's my first  look broader  my second set  it's to look closer  one of my greatest teachers was my grandfather  he taught me all about the world  he taught me how things were built and how they repair the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project  I remember one story he told me about screws  and about how you need to have the rights to for the right job there are many different screws wood screws metal screws anchors concrete screws the list went on and on  our job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customers themselves without professionals  so what do we do  I remember that story that my grandfather told me  and so we thought how many different screws could we put in the box was gonna be two three four five because there's so many different Walters so we thought about it we optimize it we came up with two different three different screws to put in the box  we thought that was going to solve the problem but it turned out it didn't  so we ship the ship the product and people work have a great experience  so what did we do we went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right  and we designed a special screw a custom screw  much to the chagrin of our investors they were like why he's been  so much time in a little screw get out there and sell more we said we will sell more if we get this right  and it turned out we did with that custom will screw that was just one screw in the box was easy to mount and put on the wall  so if we focus on those tiny details  the ones we might would that we may not see  and we look at them we say are those important or though are are is that the way we've always done it maybe there's a way to get rid of those  so my last piece of advice is to think younger  every day I'm confronted with interesting questions for my three young kids they come up with questions like why can't cars fire on traffic  why do my shoe laces have velcro instead  sometimes those questions are smart  my son came to me the other day and I asked him Hey go run out to the mailbox and check it  he looked at me  puzzled and said  what is the mailbox just check itself and tell us what does mail as I  has a pretty good question  so they can turn the questions and sometimes we find out we just don't have the right answers we say  son that's just the way the world works so the more were exposed to something  the more we get used to it  but kids haven't been around long enough to get used to those things and so when they run into problems  the true immediately try to solve them and sometimes they find a better way  and that way really is better  so my advice and that we take to heart is to have young people on your team  or people with young minds because if you have those young minds they because everyone in the room to think younger the cost so once said  every child is an artist  the problem is is when he or she grows up is how to remain an artist  we all saw the world more clearly what we saw for the first time  for a lifetime of habits got in the way  our challenge is to get back to their  to feel that frustration to see those little details to look broader look closer  and to think younger  so we can stay beginners it's not easy it requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world  but if we do we can do some pretty amazing things  for me hopefully that's better product design  for you that could mean something else something powerful  our challenge is to wake up each day and say how can I experience the world better  and if we do  maybe just maybe  we can get rid of these dumb little stickers  thank you very much

       " \"welcome to the future you guys we are live today on Facebook and on you tube I'm so happy to see you joining me as always on our show is regular musical director Adam Sandler Adam how you doing today  I'm doing fantastic crest  three back on the show yes it is looking for to meet in the cruise so what you got  we don't want those great  okay okay you know today on today show we're gonna go old school like an old fool you know you guys remember this guy member this guy I hated yes this is Jose Caballero shot caller ID  what what Adam Adam does supersede beyond it sound effects here just relax okay this is Jose and those are the guys that are new to the channel you might even be aware that we used to be called the school and I thought appropriate to bring up this graphic I know you guys missiles say he's not back but maybe we have something even better and I oppose graphic because digging through my archives here this whole business model thing and the person who could is graphics on the show and she is none other than Nicole Johnson she is a US designer it's been a couple of years and she's flown the coop and she's been out in the field work  and I wanted to bring her back because you guys have been asking for more you extra content so it's taking a little while but we got  Nicole and she's gonna be teaching us about  mental nude modeling that sounds like super fancy in cool and I she shared a little bit with me over lunch and I wanted her to come on the show it teach you a little bit in terms of how people how professional people are doing in the real world so you guys want to keep it real when they keep it raw Erika please do me a favor  no because you're locked into the containers don't hold yourself to go just a little bit longer I get the feeling today show is going to be off the chain it's going to be off the chain today you know what I was looking for a photo of Nicole and she's a little camera shy but in case you can't figure out who she is boom there she is with that super ground buffets look  you seem like really angry like just my face you don't have to be there yeah yeah no I was ecstatic actually  that's your stomach how exactly  all right so I had to dig around a little bit now apparently once you detach from Jose the mothership you stop posting on Instagram and Facebook could these photos are old I was work and look at it and I'm trying to find you in a happy space and  it was it was kind of difficult to find well that's the thinking space that's  and then I found this on with you and Vincent this is fantastic this brings me back to the to the old days right this is awesome and then there's a there's a forced smile from you with  it does say that it was a Sunday that was that was a Sunday mode so  yeah sending mode okay and his allies for a minute so yes we're taking down a trip down memory lane is this photo with everybody Adam are you in this picture I don't see you see I was asked to leave the picture  I said all the good looking people get in front of him I mean he will you push the shutter and right  all right yeah the volleyball picnic barbecue fish thing that we had done that was fun and  look in there is Nicole once and now she's got a big smile there now that's that's in a call I remember okay guys here's what I know about Nicole she is an original gangster firm the school back in the day she worked with us from two thousand thirteen in two thousand fifteen she's not passed away she's the living and breathing next to me right and some interesting fun facts she is a master certified diagnostician at Mercedes Benz and she was she's also Porter Rican an African American she played basketball basketball at saddleback college I'm having a hard time saying words today I don't know why ed she was also the director of marketing a buzz interactive pretty cool critical was the clap yeah there we go  you get one string  all right and you found in two companies pretty awesome and right now today you're at I con mobile and those two guys I don't know I called mobile they have offices all over the world how many offices do you have  we have three in North America and three in Germany and  smaller office in Shanghai actually in China okay so that's like a seven eight nine what AS graphic we're seeing here that is a map of our locations basically so that's our New York office there  it's kind of cut off but that's that's kind of a little map  that's on our website of our different offices that we have okay and was digging around the website in case you guys wanna look them up here's something interesting somethings that you guys believe in that technology is an enabler not a driver integration is the key to success user experiences the joy use not only the ease of use I think that's pretty cool mobile is a context on a device and did you check out our super contractual homepage a man that's a something's you believe in the copy needs a little it was a prayer really really  the name of the father in  and you guys have worked on some really big projects and integration of technology news experience in consumer electronic devices as well as commercial things and maybe there's some things you may or may not be able to talk about but this is the stuff that's publicly available on the website and is the last one this one is really cool I remember visiting you in your office in Santa Monica and there's a real live prototyping mock ups there this is like a smart mere right it is it is going to tell us more about this thing because this looks pretty cool yeah I mean there is a there was a couple that I can't talk too much about but this was one of four or five we made I think this was like third generation and so  we were working with  Procter and gamble to kind of come up with some new concepts of what kind of the future of of the home the future of what your bathroom experiences like  and so that trying to integrate you know things that are part of our everyday now that weren't part of the everyday when the bathroom was first created so that's kind of the the general ideas to try to integrate your your technical technology life into the bathroom okay well let's  talking let's get you on camera on it see your face those you guys I know this is Nicole Johnson I'm so happy to have you I'm happy to be here thanks for inviting me in and the reason why I wanted to have you on the show is not only because people are asking for more you X. content which were happy to oblige here you guys just relax we got her on is because we've been doing you access line but I'm always curious how does that  really big multinational company it's been doing this for quite some time do at the highest level how are you guys doing because I think there's a lot to learn so I think today you have some  exercises are some slides to share with us some slides with all right now was doing to just jump into it a little bit yeah we can't I mean it in before we do that I mean one of the things that just to kind of zoom in on what what we're actually doing  but our team is doing  you know on a day to day basis I typed projects working on the different offices have different focuses in so  our team for example is made up of the team about seven or eight people and it's  product experience so we focus and that's where you see things like world B. and things like that and those are longer tail products  or longer tail projects that maybe go a year two years three years and we're working regularly with the clients flying to them and doing updates to applications and things like that so it's a little bit bigger are German offices also do some of that they also do stuff called service design which is you know maybe you're designing a new washing machine or a new style for things like that and clients like Bausch and and and those types of projects and then we also have our in card division which is  also in Germany and a little bit in Detroit  and they focus on automotive so our office has a little bit of a blend of everything plus we have as well   a kind of a full stack development team doing like data science and doing machine learning and things like that so we have like multi disciplinary teams and also Artemis I'm sick quite international people kind of come back and forth  for different different projects which is fun now what I got a sense from talking to earlier was that you're you're working on prototypes and things that the consumer might not even see for quite sometime you're really far ahead right that's true that's true and a lot of the stuff that we're working on and and that's what's one of the most interesting things when you're doing these kind of our indie projects is it you can't talk about it much  unless it's your team or you know you can't posted on your website and so  you know even my portfolio I have wanted to update but there's certain things I can't put on there and that's okay and you know you kind of as you grow people can see what you're working on overtime three years four years down the road it might be until they see what you've been working on so it's it's fun and it's interesting on now and your current title I think recently you got a promotion solace a congratulations or the associate director user experience now yep the awesome feel good job congratulations so proud of you it's always awesome for me did to connect with people that have come through our doors in one way or the other and it's it's I'm thrilled for you and we have a lot both both you and I have a lot to think gentleman in particular Mr is like a baller for helping us on our way and I I remember asking you how do you get your position it can you you can you share the story yeah told me over lunch yeah I mean I talk about it I come mobile yeah oh yeah so I mean I had been here for two years and you guys are both going off into directions of coaching and teaching and I wanted to work on you know large scale projects and so I put my portfolio  there and I did a few interviews at places that were interesting and  got a got a call from a recruiter asking if I was interested in working on a smart mir and and of course that sounds awesome and I went in to interview and  turns out  my director at the time the guy that  interviewed me  oz Marissa fender he had actually worked with Jose and so that was again like one degree of separation as it is in the design world especially here in LA  where people know each other and so that was  not how I got the job obviously you know the work I had done here was part of it as well but that was  that was it I come mobile was a really good fit for me  it's it's  we have kind of a  maybe one year old saying of keep icon weird so it's it's a really fun group of people  both developers and designers and strategists and all the different people have amazing personalities and it's really fun to going to work every day just you're you're laughing at least a few times a day just on silly stuff and and that's fun yeah and before we go too deep I just want to make sure everybody knows the entire cast and crew behind the scenes in case they don't wind up saying something as as usual Erica's back cutting that's why the show super smooth have bothers them Hey guys and did a great job of stepping into helping us out and the man that you can just see is delusional and think ahead and show us your your new due to look at what you chose to do turned turned inside a little bit  zero man but my son is trying to go man but is it your name in the man yeah you have a man by and so now you're going to be his new hero so Aaron's gonna be munching your comments on Facebook and you to  mark is slipping in and out in terms of making sure I mean focus the lighting is good if I get too shiny here I might put on my hat there he is Larkin chairs all right now that's the whole group let's dive in enough teasing content dental modeling  what is that about okay so let me put one thing in context so we have projects that we work on and we work with this model called the double diamond and it has typically five phases double nine double diamond and its research discovery definition design and then delivering whatever it is that you made and with in that this mental modeling kind of fits and so  this is you know kind of  is a mental modeling exercises that we've massaged mental modeling as with a lot of other U. X. tools and things you'll hear it's it's not new you can you can Google it and you'll find lots of information on it  but this is kind of our take on it I guess if you want to put it like that okay that you went too fast for my little no no problem research discovery design  research discovery definition definition okay a definition design okay and then delivery okay perfect I got that in there mental mauling fits in somewhere between research and discovery and and it's it's I'm an explain what it is and then what we actually do with it and why are  can I go ahead and yes it is all right cool so I'll be taking notes yeah you guys hear me could be clocking on a keyboard that's what I'm doing okay   not texting on no I'm not I'm not working on my tender okay cool all right  so a mental model is is essentially  you know the way a person might  eight assume a system works and when I say system it literally could be anything it could be a door a chair a bottle of water it doesn't really matter could be an apt but it's how they're perceiving that this is supposed to actually work  and it's it's   these are things that are formed from a person before they even get to the point where they're realizing what they like and don't like about something so being that you ex designer as many of you probably know year your part designer your part architect your part detectives your part psychologist researcher scientist whatever you're a little bit of everything with the exes and I think that's why a lot of people find a home there because there's so many different facets of it you could do  and just from that kind of psychological standpoint we're talking about users and what a mental model is it's it's based on different levels of a person's kind of latter if inference and there's things that I'm observing  once I observe something I add my own meaning my personal meaning where I come from my background  and this sounds like it's it's really big but it's not it's just these quick snap judgments that you make based on how your mind works  I make assumptions based on data I've added date I've added meaning just anything familiarity that I have drawing conclusions I adopted believe about how something works whether it's easy or not for example and then I take action based on those beliefs  and how it relates to you acts so there's kind of six main pieces when it comes to mental modeling if you translate that of like how a person's mind works how that translates into you ex and you have Ford Ince's it which is how something appears to  meaning think about a door handle or a light switch if you see that it flips up and down you can kind of assume how it should work  simplicity of something you know how transparent is that how easy does it appear to use right away  and when it comes to my level of from a familiarity with something have I ever use something like this before is it and that's why you have a lot of these templates for you accent and buttons that you know they they should be this big and what not and that's part of that because how people's minds work they begin to adapt to certain things and that's why certain user experiences take things forward into the future and some make things more complex just unintentionally  and availability when it comes to something like how much cognitive load are you putting on a user to understand what it is that you want them to do  how flexible is something  can you can you use this this bottle of water can I understand it can I understand quickly can I you know open it anyway I want to open it you know maybe yes maybe no and so making sure something's really flexible for example   and feedback so do I understand that what I'm doing for example if I turn a light switch on and off the lights go on the lights go off that's the feedback just giving like a really simple stupid example   and then mental modeling is just part one of where we're trying to get to so I'm not mapping it right now to this double diamond I'm just talking about overall progression of what you want to get too when you're when you're designing for something so mental modeling is a tool  and then you're trying to get to a conceptual models you're gathering information and that's a modeling and this exercise is just a way of gather  information and ideas you're trying to get a conceptual models so that you can have some ideas of how an avocation might be don't get too detailed about how it should work exactly just yet but just general ideas maybe something moves from left to right maybe up and down and then you're getting to the interaction models and the wire frames in the detail  and that's kind of the progression of what you're trying to do  who else heady stuff my goodness yeah okay  our audience and do you have any smart questions yet Erin  day knowledge just a Lotta intro stuff hello is it going okay yeah that's fine so keep going then let's tractor sized truck room when one maybe Chris could you reach out for us people maybe or the people out there that we're listening  you know what I I'm trying but she went so fast and I was trying to take notes there is so I I can't do the recap yet faithfully so let's just I'm a little deeper you guys know I'll do the show recap and I'm writing notes here so what we'll get back into it so let's keep this light up for a little bit of a wait wait let's just hit this really quickly it so affordances is this how things appear to you this is how things would appear to a user and it could be any user it doesn't really matter what the system is the system could be an apple laptop something functional in the world is just literally how it appears to me personally based on how I perceive the world okay and then even be anything anything okay yeah I could apply to people as well it's like how how think how I think something should go and we all have that how I think when I when I pick up this phone what should happen when I turned it on it should turn on right or it should take me to my keypad to punch in my code or whatever right okay expect so there it's about expectations on  okay want leaders use the word affordances just call an expectation Hey these are you X. terms that you see all over the place right and one of the most interesting things about you axes that you hear all these these fancy terms this because they're all over the place okay and once you actually simplify the men to yeah it's just how it appears okay how I think that should work well check out the irony of this is the second one is called simplicity right it is and is that how easy it is it is yeah day out so we need to simplify we need apply to process to this process essentially right get out and I understand the term though I get I get it so we're gonna get educated you guys gonna learn how people in you XPW X. and sometimes we talk about this as using jargon or slogan that's Logan  jargon and inside baseball kind of talk that's okay this is an education platform gonna try and teach you few new things familiarity that's sounds like what it is right by his house and  there am I with this interface or whatever it is I'm doing what is availability about  it's cognitive load like how much how much mental work do I have to do to understand whatever it is that you made and how it works how it's supposed to work I'm what did you mention work like what is that so if I ask you if I build an app and I put it in front of you and it has  a menu toggle five tabs three buttons and I ask you I need you to order something on this and I give it to your going to have to think quite a bit as to what it is that this app is supposed to do and how I can actually accomplish my goal which is ordering something right so when you add more complexity when you add more elements and complex navigation and things  center is supposed to be implied but they're really not you're adding more cognitive load and make someone less likely to want to use whatever it is that you're making model okay that's good I think I got the  the recaps and again I think that's it and the flexibility what is flexibility about again  it's the ability to have a few different ways to use the system so that it's kind of like I don't say fail safes but it's if I you know if I hit a button here and it takes me to the wrong place there's always a way to get back or I can I can kind of move within whatever system or app or whatever it is in a way that is obvious to get in and out think of like a door and I've been using these doors and switches example is an exam the physical world yeah like if I were to open the door there and push it with the handle and then I turn around to get out and there's no handle like that's a problem right so there's no flexibility in the system there is there should be kind of something on the other side so that I can open the door either way whether I'm going in or whether I'm coming back out that's a really stupid example that's a great metaphor  I got I got it I got one in ink you so Erin as always I I love having aired on the show because he's going to just ask the questions that are general audience is going to ask because they're not steep and all this kind of stuff so here's my thought it when you said flexibility there's it sounded to me like they're multiple ways of doing something so it's not just like you're locked into one option right so I wrote on the word options and so let me see if I can reflect back what you said and tell me if  inaccurate or I'm not getting the idea here in Photoshop there's like ten ways to cut out an image you can use a pencil the lasso tool the smart one tool you can use channels you can paint it out yourself with the brush there's like ten different ways and the more complex systems are like my  or symbol for  he is like a lot of different ways you can make the same thing right and it's giving the user a lot of options so you want to go this path because you prefer this or you prefer to do it in in some other kind of procedure those tools are available to you exactly exactly right you did and there's another thing when you're looking at  this the flexibility and simplicity happen to be across from each other which was just by accident but in fact if you kind of put them on a scale the more flexibility you give the more potential for error right  if you have ten different ways to cut out something you know maybe you're using the less efficient option of Brighton versus giving two options are maybe three Max or something like that you're kind of defining that a little bit better flexibility is good but sometimes it can also be a double edged sword right  it's that's the  was I called the something about choice there like when you're not choice the paradox of choice thank you I will give you a Ding on that too has got you guys may or may not know this I feel like I'm in jeopardy  cool I'm gonna get you happy with the little dinner here look you guys maybe in another  I'm a fan of west world and so we don't have Jose in the studio but  you know he was he's like his spirit is he he's like saying so what do you say how's it  one of the things  it's actually very faint and we need to boost up the whole the Jose volume on the on the bat and there's just weird creepy whispering now at this weird with sorry  it sounds like a like hunting yeah Sir okay let's continue on then me back what is feedback about again  I'm so  anything from a light turning green when I turn on the TV you know you have TV as you have the little green light little red light it lets you know it's on or off and if it ever broke and you realize the green lights not turning on you know something's not working the way it should be and so giving giving a a user some sort of feedback that they've done something correctly it could even be like  I've ordered something to get me a check box of freezing freezing apps as an example and it lets me know it got ordered right because if you hit order and or add to cart or whatever and it didn't give any confirmation you're like I don't know if it worked right  okay yep that's perfect because sometimes I cement and my email to something I hit and doesn't say anything yeah so I hit it again again again the X. and allow for email things in my in box because you don't get any feedback no feedback okay perfect night I think that was excellent thank you for recapping you have already in the show and hopefully you guys have a better understanding about let's keep going as to the exercise all right  so with a actual exercise in a in like an actual project the goal is to get to  some definition of features or use cases and there's there's a difference between   I have a new idea and there are some examples out in the world or have any idea and there's no examples of it out in the world verses  I plan to have something that they want redesigned so those are some distinctions between this and the example I'm giving now is a client that maybe wants something redesigned and you're really trying to understand what their users are doing now  and and their industry and you're kind of a guy  leveraging leveraging their knowledge  and so the again the objectives are to learn how users perceive information within the context of a project so let's say you're building  and apps for traveling or something like that  so your understanding how different uses for Steve information your understanding what an easy system you're trying to understand what easy system which could or should contain and again trying to identify potential features and use cases you're doing it in a way that it's structured but it's free flowing enough to it to get lots of ideas and interesting insights  through kind of conversation  so when it comes to who needs to be in the room for this this isn't just a design team of U. action you I designers I mean you could do that with your team to maybe ahead of a client meeting by having the actual clients in the room when this happens is a lot of fun it gets of them engaged there are part of the process along the way and it gets you to kind of be a listener like a fly on the wall because they're having their own internal conversations about X. things that happened before things at work things didn't work and so it's it's really interesting and  in the vein of kind of Jose  you know out his favorite tool is there a favorite tools the post this stick and the sharpies and a white board or a pad for a disclaimer I know I didn't including expo markers here but I don't mean to write it with a sharpie on the white board just saying just in case good   and so so basically there's there's these core components within the exercise so we talked about mental modeling as a concept but now I'm just talking about the exercise and how we kind of work with the client  work with a team to extrapolate information and what we're doing is analyzing tasks of what's their users might be doing so let's say if it's a if it's a travel app or the travel app for road trips or whatever doesn't doesn't matter you're kind of analyzing what a day in the life of their users are doing and this goes hand in hand with actually talking to people it's not a solution for or a substitute for actually talking to real users it's just something to go in conjunction with to to get into a little bit more detail because when you're talking to users there only able to give you as much information as what their regular days like and you talk to twelve of them twenty four eighteen and you realize that maybe a few have similarities but really just breaking down what there every day is like   that's that's really the main point of of that tasks part and then you're looking at gaps and when when it comes to gaps is now not really fully needing to tie every task to a gap but thinking about in the process of going on a road trip what are some gaps in in the experience of I get into my car I have to pack a bunch of things maybe I have to look up traffic and weather before I got on the road maybe somewhere I've never been before so there's all these gaps and things like that of of how right now in its current two thousand eighteen version of going on a road trip who might have some things that could be better they're not terrible but they could be better you're taking an inventory of that and then the third step of that is opportunities cell after you've kind of gone through out the day and the  and you've gone through some gaps now it's the fun part really where everybody gets  gets to kind of go full like whatever it is that they were thinking up any of the ideas and teen their mental cop to quote Jose and really think about how future systems might work we're not putting a time line on eight or ten years or five years we're just saying any cool ideas that you think could work  and to give one example of what this might look like  in terms of  analyzing tasks letting go through all of them because I mean you can kind of  we can talk a little bit more about this but essentially going through tasks if you're talking about a road trip to apps for example for talking about travel road trips  what I need to do before I'm taking off while I'm driving when I'm part is there any miscellaneous things that don't really fit into any of those categories and so what you're doing is you're doing this on a big white board hopefully ideally  and you're having the client due to the writing you're doing some listen you add a few here and there if you have some ideas  but for the tasks you're really getting them to empty their cops and tell us you know what other users doing and it also gives you insight as to whether or not how how well they know their users  and so that's that's that's the analysis of tasks part the gaps part is even more when you need the clients is because they know their industry and they know their product and where it's succeeding and where it's not and so the gap section there's basically three three versions of what we see here one for analysis one four gaps and one for opportunities and  you're basically just going through this and this exercise take  probably anywhere from an hour and a half to two hours depending on how talkative the team is and they're deliberating amongst themselves and with us  and then what we're doing after that  is is doing affinity mapping and so we're stepping back and looking at all the stickies  and now we're starting to group things together and we're starting to identify these categories of things that are  potential similarities when it comes to tasks potential similarities and items that are all related for gaps and same for opportunities and then from there you can start to figure out what features or use cases and keep in mind the distinction between a feature a use case is is not that far off a feature is kind of the umbrella and there might be multiple use cases within a feature that kind of define  more specific instances of how something should work  and this is this is essentially the exercise this is this is what we do and it ends up being a massive wall of sticky is but everybody is super colorful super fun everybody enjoys it and feels like they've been heard and have the opportunity to kind of  voice their their thoughts  wow okay I can go back well I'm do we okay that's do you understand how to do this can you be you X. expert  the school is  it is to get out here you're like give me a job that I come over  he'd a junior associate director of user experience that was why not why not  what about what you learned reflect back so basically you ask people  like in the bathroom the bathroom example like what do you do in the bathroom and try to find holes in my routine that maybe  are not super convenient or whatever and then you just try to plug that hole with a solution  to make my whole bathroom or whatever experience a little smoother has pretty succinct that's pretty good yeah number though yeah yeah I know I'm not on talking  that's what I think every single day on that though with exercise like when I was looking for to like breaking down some process and why didn't want to go crazy deep so this is we can talk about the process itself though if you guys have questions Holland yeah before we  I I believe you should let me call direct her exercise their workshop right so there's some questions or any people asking is is going to be available on slideshare nickel nope no pressure  that I mean we could possibly put this on Fletcher okay must be up maybe something you guys that you know I don't beat me up in the streets if you see me if I did yeah yeah exactly you guys come on pay attention I will take notes right now we're gonna do okay should feel honored that people actually want this I know that's a great  alright let's keep going  all right so when it comes to kind of other other things that we do with clients this is like literally zoom in to one specific exercise it's not it's not something that I could say this is you X. it's literally and act in a project over the course of a year  doing this you know maybe in months months three or four  after you've kind of gotten to know the industry after you've gotten to know a little bit more about users and really what you're trying to do everything we're trying to do  you when it comes to these exercises and this goes back to what I was saying is online you'll go and you'll look up you acts and there's there's like  three million different terminologies and ways of doing things and this is just our interpretation my interpretation and and ways that it made the most sense to be able to get information from you know from users get information from a client  gather and synthesize ideas and then turn it into something within a certain time line and that's really what we're trying to do and there's a lot of terminology from my own perspective when I  when I first started where you know either you know even Jose you know early on was using terminology or kind of  riffing on experiences from the past and until at least my personality style as some of you might know is is  I have to do it I have to do it  and set yeah  good or bad and before I really can absorb it and I think sometimes when we're listening to like I'm sure the people listening to me talk right now they're like scratching their head or like I don't get it or get maybe I went too fast so sorry  but not stirred on her own no no nice  but yet but you know you hear all these terms and it's not until you actually are in a real life client scenario  that you're able to really figure out what really makes sense so there sometimes it's it's like you know depending on your on this road is a UX designer and you have this toolbox and as you keep going down the road more stuff gets put in your toolbox and depending on the scenario after your toolbox  it's more full you know if you're doing something with a client that's the brand new project and your brand new product that doesn't exist in your making it from scratch okay I have to just have to pull a few different things for my toolbox to get more information or we know that this scope is going to be small and they already know what they want to meet you plot a few last things for it and that that's really what you're doing and this is literally just as you man and I don't want to spend too much time on this because it's it's just  a zoom in on one one like very specific thing  that we use as far as gathering information while we're doing throughout these phases when it comes to research again were out and we call it in the field but worked you know visiting locations where the users are  if it's if it's drivers if it's whatever and work we're talking to them  because you gather real worlds just absurd observational fly on the wall type of data from from them just watching them and you can ask questions here and there but coming back to to this mental modeling again it's it's just a it's a snapshot of a major like potentially year to year long project okay now before we do that I went to a question that you okay yeah we have a bunch of good question okay outlaw star and I will ping pong back in all right and then we'll get into it so let's see if this derails the entire conversation I don't care if he we got okay Justin Parker's asking is you X. the new money in the design world you could have a great brand that bad you acts and still not profit what do you think about that  I would I would lean towards Justin being accurate I wouldn't say that it it discounts any of the other disciplines them because  all the other disciplines like  they're they're all internal parts of of the process so   for example like our product experience team here we have you acts and we have you I and we have some motion designers and if I you know me and are you Eckstine design an amazing experience something we couldn't create you know the U. I. that goes with it but it's the collaboration with them that really makes something amazing verses you know you acts alone though I know that you know companies now especially is experiences have gotten better and easier to use that's like it's the expectation now verses the   what's the word  it's it's kind of the expectation verses like this new surprise right so if something back in the day was easy to use it's like wow okay this things easy to use but I still have to use this and this and this and that and all these different devices or whatever now X. experiences being simple fast  that's that's the norm now that's not that's not a a new novelty thing all right cool nice Erin's next question next question what tools do you use to organize a lawyer like all this research you're doing like I don't have any clothes could you  could someone advice  somebody's not most people aren't gonna like this one  so so I have I have been working a company that we are we're like part of a publicly traded to kind of  organization so there's a lot of the cool new like organizational tools that we can't use so we do still have to   in some cases resort to excel which is tried and true  like excel documents actually help us a lot  but but there's there's so many tools out there when it comes to  when I would use for a personal project there's a new tool  that I've been using for again just personal stuff called lotion and that has the combination of of a little bit of everything honestly like it's online the app is super easy to download and it's you can do to do lists and tasks but you could also do you know checking off tasks were within a project or sharing documents and files so it's  it's really easy to use  when it comes to just one little deeper thing of the question  the types of tools that we're using ask the office are things like  we're still using we use actor actuary is amazing as a you extol  and for those who aren't as familiar with you know all these again policies for all the extra again  actually  eight X. U. R. E. there's as your which is for a development thing don't look that up it's scary  no actually is this this tool basically for wire framing  and also that you do like prototyping and it also if you're a kind of using a shared server within your office I can upload a new version of a document to my team no matter where they are they can check in my latest updates without having to you know zip a file and share that as well another one is keynote keynote is literally you know my one of my favorite tools would say it's it's  flexible it allows you to do a lot of different types of things even if you wanted to do some super super simple prototyping and keynote you can actually do that do some simple animations and whatnot  and again for documentation of the heavy things like these mental modeling exercises or user responses from a testing session you're still going to need things like excel or some type of spreadsheet thing it could even be Google docs  again those those cloud tools that we are able to use as much  are useful for teams are working a part or again versioning control which is also a thing and design as we know final final final final and things like that so yeah so to reek of use keynote notion and maybe some excel keynote notion excel sure after  gesture yep and well how come you can use all the regular cloud tools Google and normal people use mostly security thing because where we have sensitive  client information and if that's on somebody else's cloud servers  that's that's a breach of security base and I'd like to place it at my mean we'd we do have a you have to have clients like Procter and gamble Bosch Audi you know these large companies so that's that's not yeah name dropping name drops raining blames here   another in a program  it's a cool anyway it's all good and another good question real simple one man redeem myself and I really want  if you're young graphic design college student on  sorry what's one pieces sought advice for new York's guy that's from  somebody shot all right as an asset she gets in the  okay want is a son of vice for New York sky  that's a great question  I would probably say something along the lines of a learning   learning the the primary steps of U. X.  and for me  I I did go to General Assembly in two thousand twelve as part of the first class in LA and that was really helpful for me not in a real world  you know kind of we're talking about now what a large scale project what are all the steps but it did give me insight into a lot of this jargon and a little bit more time to absorb it as opposed to that when I was doing before that which was Lynda dot com videos and teaching myself certain things which was all fine and good but it was it was all theoretical and then that took me into tactical like literally what tools my supposed to use at that time it was like on a gravel actually  was like super crazy expensive as a as a young designer you're not gonna buy after that's for large teams but on the graph full or sketch which is super awesome as well I don't use that as often anymore but that was a fun one  just adding to that list of other tools  they're pretty much saying yet you should go to General Assembly as a line saying you should go to some sort of small program to solidify some of the information and also be around like minded people who are also trying to learn different parts of you acts and through networking events could be products school could be General Assembly it could be any of these types of things that are out there doesn't have to be General Assembly interesting that's where I went  but yeah I I would get I would try to get some some found  Asian in in what you axe is unless you've already done that and they make you look at expert like this even in the field for a while you're kind of maybe not an expert but getting close I mean could you share like a piece of wisdom just something like how you look at things you know or I talk to people or something like that that's actually really funny because when I was working with Jose and Chris I remember having conversations about you know it not being about  when you're learning things from people like me talking to you right now is my you know my mind coming out of my mouth and telling you my experience but until you kind of where to sit with me and watch me every day working or talking to people you know without just giving advice or whatever you you start to get into the mind of how the person you're looking at thinks and you know when it came to like Chris and Jose I started to learn not what they were telling me that they were thinking which was important to but also how they're thinking about things  it going back to again just the the General Assembly part or something like that and then the next thing would be to try to find a mentor and you know that that picture that that Kerr showed there was I think the day if I remember correctly that I went after Jose after about like three or four school events and I had gotten to know some of the people around and I just asked if he'd be my mentor  just for coffee and things like that I was literally thinking that's all it be and then within a few weeks and ended up being an apprenticeship sell you know three months of an apprenticeship and then it ended up being two years of working on projects and traveling and doing you X. consulting  about that six right here I'm talking about that I think that was the day I am pretty pretty sure  that was the day Sir remember that venue that was we work in  somewhere I think it was we work in Hollywood I am quite Hollywood Connors and there it was really hot yeah there was in it it was you know that wasn't that was out of yours that is the case melting right idea is that the merge conference the right yeah exactly so so basically my point is is try to get some some rooms you know tactical you know training and you X.  and surrounding yourself with people and going to events and and also trying to find a mentor and even if it is just the coffee that's okay too  but getting that I'm you know place you can ask questions without feeling like you just don't know what's which way to go because again with you acts there's so many different things you could be doing from researched information architecture and until you really understand what those are talking to someone that does it eat and it's harder to make that decision about what it is you talk they want to do in the the bubble if you axe  question where were you before yes of course I I will hold your question can you hold your question  okay older person because this is a perfect time for Adam to play a little piece of music so I could you tomorrow yeah  we're going to go on and I'm  the government  perfect  you are asking for resources we have it as a resource is right here on this very channel and networking you guys go to the future dot com  you can check out the course I did you get the letter went together to help teach you user experience design that is it comes with a whole bunch of videos at a work but you guys might enjoy that it's four hundred eighty nine dollars it's not cheap but it's a lot cheaper than General Assembly which is that okay that is true four K. but this  so study thing and this is a go at your own pace now that might be too expensive for a lot of the guys and whose is also put together the U. X. master class which is a series of webinars he cut together and and people seem to love that so if you want to just explore what this is about maybe that's a friendlier price for you I definitely and I mean the the funny thing is is a lot of these things here  they were they were helpful tools they didn't come in like a perfect pretty package like you guys are like  super shiny and polished now but yes we are is our awesome tools all over this awesome they were awesome because they gave a practical foundation of how to like step by step talk to somebody and get ideas for get their ideas into something that made more sense because you step by step talk to somebody who yeah exactly  out what figure what figure out what it is that they're asking for so if it's a if you're doing freelance you're sitting with a client one on one you got that I said at a coffee shop and do that brand actually to exercise you can do the persona development exercise with them  through a Skype session or whatever you can also do this with large scale teams and that's why those tools I mean again they've they've grown and they've become very shiny and polished and I really think it's super awesome but the  you know that that the foundation of them of something that I could take as a workbook and I can see and again this is why Jose and in the U. X. world is so so brilliant is that he's breaking it down to you step by step  and you know this combined with a mentor which was kind of what I experienced is super helpful and  that's kind of how you learn you have to do the same exact kids and a little bit all day yeah and on yet but it started with me doing a start up  crashing and burning not understanding you ex except for in theory starting to Google and dig and dig and watch actually way way way back in the day Jose on a start up what was a call this week in web this week in web watching Jose before I even met him on this week and wet and then you know kind of watching videos and then that translating into I should probably go to some sort of school that was my interpretation of it you don't have to do that and then it kind of was a an interesting journey okay I just want to say that  somebody is a big fan of Erin today Rachel Jim so less be saying Erin's pretty good with questions today on the way there and well done with a clarifying questions big okay I know that  questions Erika please what was your question  so my question was the  when do you include the U. I. designer or they there from the beginning  typically if we're referring to you know talk about this whole five phase process and sorry to bring a photo of the double diamond but  this five phase process you're typically working in parallel starting about just after research and the reason is you know the US designers were the you know the you know designer scientist that want to go out and gather information and and put that all together and synthesize form and then wish were typically sharing that with the U. I. team  and then they from there with that information start to get a feel for  a feel for what it is that might work and they're doing exploration boards and things like that politically do three two or three of them and show them to to client and so after that happens from then on we're really working in full on parallel and with our team you know where we're sitting pretty much all together so you're   constantly  working with tweaking or you know what we learned this needs to be a little bit bigger or even after usability testing you know we need to make updates and changes so it's it's really  an ongoing thing ideally you can work in parallel sometimes it's not super perfect and we need to do a little bit more work before they can start but that's the typically were working together in peril  all right since the road in all caps I feel like if I don't say something heads are going to explode Ono okay so polio is asking questions again there's a little too there chill with the tude I'm a design with over ten years of experience I want to move into you ex and you I design  please give us advice do I need to go to go back to school to get a certificate etcetera and I think Nichols already given you a price she's answered as which is you need to get some kind of foundation you can go to many resources this General Assembly can learn some things on Linda but you got to get your feet wet you try things out but a great ways to go to conference and ask somebody to go out for a Cup of coffee just to get in there just get started doing this because the first time first couple times you may not get it right right in that the other question I would I would ask back I don't know if we're able to ask questions bachelor is   what what makes you want to move into you acts from from graphic design I have the quote something in my head that a lot of  graphic designers who are like pure graphic designers have told me  but I would be okay to hear all right since we can't actually here I'm I'm going to play the role of the worst right we'll see it has a the errands on the look out for the the reply here Tracy of applies but I'm gonna guess that it seems like when you're in traditional design there aren't as many opportunities  it seems like if you move into the U. S. there are  jobs in Silicon Valley high paying jobs and people are looking for more designer city you ex and you why so higher pay more opportunities maybe  this is true I also think there's a there's a personal spin on it as well that that is added to that as as people that I've seen that really excel in U. X. design and oranges masters at it are are creative and analytical at the same time and the ones that have that desire to move into you X. that's beyond just that the war the you know the high paying jobs which is also again a bonus is that the  when it comes to is this read enough is this the right tone of it is it block  the the   I guess the subjective nous of of visual design in a lot of cases  kind of it rubs them the wrong way and say want more tangible reasons as to why a design is the way it is and they're they're seeking out you X. even if they don't really know what they're they're being more logical as as well as they used to say Spock like and so  that that's the type of person that wants to get into the system of why something works the way it is a really excels in you accent I don't see nothing you need to be a systems thinker but it really does help in terms of having slightly creative and you know like cool ideas but also thinking of systems and how you can take this big idea and put it into something that's that makes sense to other people well let's get back to I wanna make sure we have enough time to cover the rest of what you have planned for us and not to  we can we can keep battle of a no no I don't want to I slow one is because I want to learn from what you have and then we can address questions with whatever remaining time that we have to get an idea okay the send back in that's all the questions for a little bit you guys that are watching on Facebook and YouTube you can continue to ask her questions and Erin and myself will continue to pick through them okay let's do it yet so I don't have any more slides side we don't just talk no no no I want to just talk I think it's probably easier and people can ask questions that way okay so I like those three problems that you had in terms of tasks gaps and opportunities let's apply to something something that our audience can relate to let's do this in real time okay you want to work on your your your new one duplicate this light is it an edible thing or the impacts none now let's get into this I think this is a process so let's let's start with a blank slate yep that's okay what's that our audience right now what's a prompt that you want us to work on what what kind of situation a scenario nickel I want you to run this because I don't want to put I don't wanna do this the way that I'm doing I want to see how you do it now it's all fine to one direct them so so essentially what we'd be doing as let's say let's say we're making an app that would be for people that are going on road trips  maybe it would be something that would help them to make going on a road trip with well and I had the drug you I don't want to do the road trip you're to give the road trip okay okay as you do something different can can you give us okay people on you tube and on Facebook give us a prompt a problem for us to solve yeah is that a tasking activity we want them to focus in on or you want to call you could maybe mention one that you're currently working on that you're stuck on and then we'll  stuck you for free  well we don't I don't really have anything that I could actually prior but we can talk about something that everybody can relate to  just going to work driving to work could be that too you're all about driving aren't you  so the roads right number of the driving round trip okay so there's a couple things here it's amazing food delivery health homelessness app a personal assistant app let's let's get a couple more an escape room with super powers I don't know what that means okay but that's awesome right it is pretty awesome yeah yeah homelessness homelessness I'm sorry delivering coffee motivation to work out health care okay  of those which ones which one makes the most sense for a motivational work I think motivational  I like that idea okay a problem so if we can work out so if we were to break this down into a few different kind of day in the life of of of person out what we're looking for is these categories so in this driving example that I've been giving in the reason I'm steering that way was because this kind of it Max out at the moment and this normally you're thinking about okay when it comes to working out  what are what are the different parts of a person's day okay here's what we'll do Anne and I will be the client yeah and then we will participate in if you guys want to answer a long will also read the comments so we're to do this weird hybrid interactive school right now okay so here right back at you ready you ready improvised yeah let's do it so the the prompt here's a motivation to work out so Erin and I'm gonna be your Guinea pigs and you can edit this in real time right I am going to edit this I'm gonna go to full screen that can do that easily hides set up so this would be like part of like some kind of weight loss out where you somehow show me images or something to get me to want to work out it could yeah let's say you guys are clients let's let's put a little bit more yeah text to it right so you guys are a client  that you guys have a fitness out it's been out for a little while  you guys are looking to maybe get more funding  and for that reason you want to  I knew when I screw that right want to improve it you want to address something that wasn't quite working with it that you want to get that next series series a round of funding let's say that let's put it in start up contacts this is excellent because he won't say we both Erin and I are the role models for the fitness app I don't because the working out all right let's do that so so analyzing users tasks what I'm looking for is at a high level these categories appear what is the day in the life of a person that's working out not everything they're doing when they're working out there there's literally their day so what is your days of like you get up in the morning maybe you have breakfast  so early morning  annual operation anything right so then that's a big thing yeah so let's do morning ma'am  but still afternoon to this day in the life this is Dan life does analyzing the timing is writing so you opening up to me much broader than just working out exactly okay these are things that they but they play into health and fitness right in your day in court of working I like that's that's  no I'm not I'm not questioning your  yeah he is alright  no no no  track here go about on land you know Jeez that's not gonna happen  so so basically you're you're looking at this I may leave this miscellaneous column I like to leave this in here and the reason I like to leave this in here is that there's going to be these things that don't quite really fit in the morning afternoon evening it could be things you do late night or the things that just are just random as right could resume into that is there any way that this kind of clear that up yeah and you can  yeah see honestly that that's clear enough for everybody I got a black belt that you know you guys relax called third degree and so on so  morning yet what are some of the things that you're doing in the morning you got to get ready for work you gotta do meal prep  what is what is meal prep entry grill or people who are really serious about working out they have to prepare their meals because you can't just run to a fast casual place and get the kind of food you want you I know somebody a crystal no used to work here he would portion out all these meals measure the protein and get all that stuff set for the day orderly extreme well I'm gonna say is into extreme I was thinking more like just have a healthy breakfast of like opening  that's there's no filtering here this is not brand attributes but it's kind of there's no filtering are we saying when we really do mean Chris we really do or things like Chris it making milk what felt that things you and I are business partners okay we have a fitness app to help to motivate people to work out  that's the role I'm playing right now exactly follow Aaron okay as a member I roll it yeah we're playing a role okay okay but I mean but in the in the vein of fitness you you do you exercise you are human and you would probably do some of these tasks right so you're either going to be talking through the lens of your user the lens of yourself and and clients do both right because they're either are whatever it is that they that was recently created a rap or whatever so it's it's something on profit all intertwined made so so you might be thinking about going to gyms he might be packing your gym bag as somebody suggesting  just to make sure that you got the shoes on the work out whatever yep  so that after you work out your gonna shower  yeah hopefully Erin yeah  but that all your all your bathroom stuff yeah yeah yeah and these are things that you're writing with a sharpie on a post it so it's not like lady things you guys are doing great here so Erin and I are like just flying through all the sharpies and the note  the post it notes exactly writing a bunch of things there anything else you want to talk about in terms of you working on the morning  I was just thinking that you have the same tools as like a fifth grader colored paper and markers they're amazing  think of the most fun time of one  okay your does anything  I don't know man  was your question again see this is a problem what do you do in the morning this is this is this is this is like real life this is all good this is fine so what what are some of the things that you're doing in the morning that are part of  playing into health and and your fitness save have something's already so get ready for work that's totally fine we can leave that one in there but meal prep plays perfectly into that having healthy breakfast packing your gym bag these are all things that are  could be direct indirect or just parallels of thing right are inter related to fitness maybe are also responding couple emails in the morning yeah yeah yeah  oops bad speller sorry okay the worry you ever even here that's right from as I I know it's all right we forgive you and now you're on the spot you guys anybody has ever been on the spot you somehow your spelling just doesn't work no this is even not on the spot that's no strategy I know it is okay I'd rather be honest rather be honest than to try to yeah all right so afternoon someone or some afternoon tasks similar to the morning that are inter related to your health  fitness it could be working out it could be  going for a walk you know to clear your head at work but you're also obviously exercising a little bit you get your blood pumping  so we'll play going for a walk  we have a lot of our designers that like to to do that and we actually started a walking club so that's that's fun  all right so with some other things  I know this is gonna sound kind of weird now but  I know this that it's a lot to do with the lunch I have  have a really big lunch or if the meal it if I don't eat the right foods at the right times I'll be too full or have way too low energy in the hungry to work out a low energy for the like manage my energy and food  okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna put low energy that's not tasks so early to manage my energy  or do we want to call it eat healthy  I mean that's a healthy breakfast manage energy  the sounds good yeah okay like that yeah okay what's something else in the afternoon that happens related thing you're trying to you're trying to get all your task done for the day I mean yeah I'm assuming you're at work you've come back from lunch they just trying to finish your your tasks yeah okay are you are you standing for work are you sitting in front of the theater  yeah  and for me sometimes I just need that extra jolt  because after lunch you you have that post food coma thing other sale coffee some I'm looking for a little pick me up here TV me because of rare and yeah okay a drugs rather be  this is not the kind of mean since marijuana is legal here I'm sure a lot of folk in the cave in  that no part of this  okay I can I can I can do it in the vein of Jose smoke a bowl I don't know whatever you guys want to call it and  it's like no matter where Jose is in the world is spiritually  suffering from squirrels and drum yeah exactly yeah  only in appropriate things to talk about but let's keep on it's all in good fun so so coming back so now let's talk about the evening so in the evening are you what are you doing in the evening Stillwater your users doing okay evening what time are we talking about here yeah good question that's a good question myself six seven you know it's a six you know what we should put at work here as well okay you don't you try to do then potentially in the evening you try to get worked out so you can be traffic home but maybe want to go to Jim now that Jim time into the gym time yeah this is when it starts for me like I'm not going to go today and I gonna you should go and then so you're so so let's let's having an internal like yeah internal games there to four okay all right fair enough  but thou and I know when I talk to Iran forest he's not really there when I'm talking to him  it is a entered a lot I appreciated the distraction obviously  internal conflict what else you have going on in the evening are you going to the gym to be put that here yes go straight from work and trying to find the motivation to go to the gym yeah Netflix and whatever or just to eat for  do you eat before you work out see that's a that's why I was saying the timing of  in the mills is important business trip I got to have something like that six right before I leave or else of the two hundred  work so quick snack yeah that's like an important not very important is that the life that has seven of energy  an important one make sense like the pre workout meal or whatever is that what you're supposed to do poll why would you know I'm sorry I'm going  right now it's like I'm I'm not a building this but  we can talk to some users and  do some research  okay so now and this miscellaneous calling doesn't need to be filled out is there anything that doesn't really fit into any of these that are kind of part of this your tasks throughout the day morning afternoon or I I got a good one from Nathaniel for the evening he's a talk about checking your workout plan  old super good command genius who was there are too many comments Aaron instead of thinking about your internal dialogue he's having it right now it's now it's too early yeah a couple of people are saying they're the internal conflict of four PM is real yeah  it's so real so so what was that what can you say that again sorry I was yeah it's just talking about that thing about your work out routine workout plan  planning work out okay  and do we want to leave this miscellaneous blank is there any anything that came up that's that's good for that category  someone mentioned meditate on that's that is mind body that's good now  okay meditate I'm gonna put that  you could do that technically at any point in the day  so we'll put that here let's get  anything else  not to be the only one that's fine  I think you're dances be created here what are we thinking about miscellaneous anything else that's miscellaneous like meditation could literally fit into any point man in it doesn't really I know one is like when I look at my Instagram sometimes if I see like I don't know like a hot girl or  do working out on my own and I should work out early  social motivation and has a little bit of power over me if I see like a good image  social motivation and I get  I'm the same way  we have someone mentioned  okay  anything else  what do I like a work out buddy having a buddy someone mentioned that  is that so like texting a friend kind of a thing chlorine I know if I had like a really both friend that was like for a let's work out right now I mean I might work out more  okay I'll call you one yeah I was gonna say Chris way that I will call you more often as your buff bro right so so we've got some interesting stuff here let's go big here so we've got in the morning getting ready meal prep answering emails packing my gym bag getting healthy breakfast in the afternoon we're going for a were at work then we go for a walk maybe after lunch you're sitting at your computer  you're trying to manage your energy whether that means getting a coffee tea or smoking a bowl could mean anything  in the evening  you're still at work  you're trying to get home you're having this mental internal conflict about you know we do I go to the gym or not or do I just go watch Hulu or Netflix  heading to the gym  that site needing motivation that heading to the gym  maybe having a quick snack somewhere in between  and plan your work out so I didn't really put that in chronological order so forgive me guys okay  your life in some of these meditating meditating or texting a friend to go work out with you as additional motivation or social motivation so I feel like motivation is an interesting kind of things that if we were kind of doing some affinity mapping  here that would be kind of an interesting development here okay so in real life Erin and I would be working with the team lead the writing these things down on a post it note in the final and then you a prompt us that slop among the law yeah I literally just draw columns with  which are columns with sharpies and put this morning afternoon evening so it's done very you know kind of relax and that way we're not forcing this kind of you know  you have to do it this way we're just asking that they only thing we do ask is that we we give about maybe five minutes per column so we're not just everybody's putting stuff everywhere we're focusing on morning focusing on afternoon okay Sir time boxing in utilizing it but at the same time yeah exactly track okay exactly what's next up so the next step would be a similar thing but we do  do that gap analysis so same basic thing and world will copy paste this balcony over here so as I'm taking notes here are the task always a day in the life and that's what we're trying to get yeah the tacit don't because you're really you're trying to do this version of identifying what the users kind of every day is like without actually having these are necessarily sitting there either experience from the clients because they know their users or maybe at that point you've already done twenty interviews and you've also talked to people so now it's it's a combination of user interviews a maybe have tucked away  in a document somewhere maybe you've kind of documented that room but it's also now really just having some time to think like what are some other things that maybe we didn't hear from users that they really do but they didn't mention and so this is what you're really trying to do in this exercise is really kind of granular go through a person's day because when you can do that you can figure out where there's where there's reasons why maybe they would use your app at this certain time of day they don't have time or it's too complex if I'm sitting at my desk or in a meeting to plot a nap and check something or whatever and you can kind of come up with interesting ways to work around a person as opposed to trying to make the person work around the way your app works or the way your experience works whatever that means totally makes sense to me so let's dive into let's just do this real quick yep  to get to keep the energy going here all right so what we do next so we're looking at gap so now we're still looking at the same time line  zoom in again here we're looking at the same time on him nothing has changed  so morning afternoon evening except for now we're looking at in terms of you know my health and my fitness what are some things that aren't so great in terms of maybe it's me that I'm I'm not super motivated to do something or you know whatever act we have been and are you guys are our clients here whatever the apt is it it doesn't do X. Y. Z. E. or it needs to tell me this and it doesn't right now I need to tell me  what my caloric intake is for the day before I head out so then I know it in my head I need to hit fifteen hundred and I can't go over that something like that and is this through the lens of the actual product that we make now it's to the product and then thinking about you know what we just did here  it doesn't have to map one to one  so it's not healthy breakfast and has to map one to one but now thinking about the product right and I got it yeah I got it what if the the the app woke you up in the morning and just told you I can just tell you what to eat  okay hello healthy bowl a granola and a protein gel that he suggests Jennings yes so it's adjusting see see you guys are going to the fun part which is what everybody likes to do which is the opportunity section so we'll get to that in a minute so hold hold your ideas not time for having fun right it's not right but it's really thinking about things now you can if if it's easier to think about because we have this pretend kind of thing where you think about in the morning what would be nice to have if if something were to be able to like you said wake you up so waking up is a struggle in the morning right so let's let's just say that yeah  so where some of the challenges this is kind of a challenges section if we want to say it but waking up  what to eat what to eat  what to wear how did my hair okay these are there going on  all right we'll put what to wear the I should just leave it to you in a room and see what you guys as you try to rein in a cat yeah it's all good it's all good I I I if if I can if I can do this with Jose I can do this with anybody I feel like I'm out out  well you know exactly what you say Aaron I was just thinking what you were you were saying about like pretty much you want someone to take care of all this for me just manage all those good information on eating healthy and working out and just feed it to me in a way I can use it right now and what kind of food you like this is that okay that or what's my work I routinely yeah well it's it's like almost like the best thing would be a person in charge of this but I can't help for  in prison cheese so your solutions personal assistants  get about the yeah isn't it just call the person Susan you're no rain is in rain is so slow so basically what we're doing here again let's let's talk so we have waking up we have what to eat we have what to wear  lady maybe it's gonna tell us the what the weather's like today whether I need to know the weather because I need to know what what I need to wear perhaps a good to  you know I need to know what the traffic situation is like okay right  Sir I I think those things are relevant to what I have to do in the morning  Khloe saying good morning you are awesome you know you can't wait for this great day it might rain grab your umbrella  I think this is right yeah she's right  she's writing copy that only you you'll be ready for the next day I trust me you're gonna be so good  you just let me know what you guys can act after the show  and so all right so let's move into the afternoon what are some of the the challenges or the gaps and what you you would like to have that you don't have in the afternoon  so that they were going to lunch right so we've we've gone to lunch  you know I think  what what what is that  it reminded us distracts from time to time to get up and get away from the machine  that that's a problem because I'm too laser focus on work and and then my body tightens up  because that would be a threat I could yep that's real good point good point good pay item I know your health not what you contribute to this exercise you got in the when I do this   yet Hey by the way can you hear me better yes I can hear you perfectly alright I check my  from  you know I'm I'm just looking to pick up my calories to a finite amount  that's all we control calories or OR and monitor calories are you mention that but keeping that consistent throughout the day that's that's the tough part there  okay  someone somebody saying a sedentary warning like this yeah kind of time like you're just sitting still for too long yeah so that's goes in and that's that's the the most interesting thing about this exercise is when the   why am I spelling this complete around okay  when you're doing kind of this with people who we don't want to focus on where things aren't working so we we have solutions for things but how do they mapped to kind of a little bit what what we know the act does or what we know it doesn't do but it could do so this is this is great so  let's talk so about knowing when to stretch so the solution we talked about and we'll save those please don't forget those sanitary let that would go on the opportunity section  so what's a couple more in the afternoon things that are gaps and again this is the most challenging part because you really have to think about where in your day  are you know kind of lacking in information or  again  alerts whatever it is  well I I told me I would love it to be able to log how I feel a little bit because maybe I'm not paying too much attention so sometimes I eat a certain kind of food and I feel really lethargic afterwards so I would like to be able to monitor that a little bit so your moods yeah my mood and energy level I need to measure that  okay so make it easy for me  the mood right  the the app comes with a mood ring yeah feel like for example if I go out and I somehow indulgence of having some fried chicken or something and at the moment so I'll go but later that day I like both  and just feeling really sleepy right now right  yeah and so evening  can our in the evening  Erin  what we do now maybe it he started showing me pictures of girls working out or something  this is a different kind of half has changed a lot   I don't notice any motivation I need some they give me the fuel to be like you can do this ma'am you got it to have a drink or something I like a smoothie drink or something  you're asking a lot from your app  that's what you need to use and I'm telling you  enter to have the movie before you go to work out maybe  tell me want to drink it yeah I know right now    red is a this is quickly becoming a personal says that yeah  these things from because pretty much don't they'll become that no no and and this exercise is a broader one that you would do earlier in the project like I said where you want to learn more about what the users are actually doing and where some of the challenges and where are some ideas and then you begin to map all of that we're doing as you X. designers always mapping tool goal so the goal is whatever the client wants to achieve which is again adding some new seats  we're having some new ideas for features and so you're you're mapping this to to features and then these are a lot of ideas but this is not gonna be the end result  okay so it's it's like I need motivation right now because it's in the day I want to take a short cut I don't want to work out right now and I need you to pump me up so the actual solution and I don't know I just need to pumped up for Erin it's like seeing how girls work out  somebody else might want to see an inspirational quote or something I just need to find the energy so I can get myself to the gym or like a work out routine like all the rock to this work out today you should do it too something  recommendations on work I recommend workout routine like someone I think about it yep okay like it read what I did yesterday he's I only did back yesterday got to do just  do you do this today yeah and then so here's what we're gonna do we're going to switch over to opportunities that you guys can't say focus that you are working with Canada because it's like no matter how many times you told you just tell me the problem they'll tell me the solution you guys are here's what you can do everything on time  yeah yeah exact running too realistic real bad client no it's okay it's all good  no so we'll move into future opportunities and this is where everybody has the most fun honestly it is because this is where like you said so we talked about things in the morning so you said   tell me what to eat   to me  tell me how to eat but what's  what's something aside from just tell me what to eat what's something that could be a potential solution actually for for that meaning allow  I am I know what and maybe there are some really good recipes so that you can break up the area the hum drum of these these super healthy foods right yeah interesting ways to eat the same thing but just mix it up show me easy recipes yeah morning Casey Casey easy recipes and maybe somewhere in there too is I don't know where it may be in the miscellaneous column is when you're out shopping reminds you things like if you if you had starlink a like that tell you next time at trader Joe's in the pick up these things okay so I'm gonna rein it in a little bit raining that  so that would be somewhere one in the evening if you're shopping yeah probably most likely okay so  so what did you say that again sorry  yeah it's like a shopping shopping lists mmhm yep grocery shopping list of like that  is it recommending things to you or no is it based on the recipes that you okay I have highlighted like the that was delicious  I'm gonna try that so it's going to now create a shopping list based on the recipes are like that's cool okay yeah  so we got that going on  and what are some other things so sorry guys I'm done all this moving around there could be a a laundry pick up drop off service that's attached to this because you know we're working out in Dallas stinky clothes and home that's that's an idea that would be in miscellaneous someone mentioning in the comment that it's like for someone that simplifies more this is getting super confusing right now could you address the one area so but it's not there so if you're literally I'm I'm gonna be super my literal self if you are  let's let's take this through  really quick just hit pause for a second on on the exercise  you have done six weeks of research you did Google laying you went out and to jams and you talk to people  you interviewed fourteen twenty eight people at different gyms across southern California and you gathered information about what their days like you gathered information about you know just what some of their pain points are  even like what what kind of apps are they using you're asking these questions as you're moving in to the next part your your actually eat now sitting down with the client showing them what their users saying and what the users are liking and not liking about their products and then you're sitting down and you're you're sitting there and mapping these things out this is going to be part of a bigger puzzle it's just a piece of the puzzle and I know that it's kind of like you XP comes weirdly like math and not in that you need to do any calculus sometimes  but what you're doing is there's an order of operations and this is somewhere earlier and you know solving a problem and it's not the solution it's just gathering information you're not gonna get to the solution until you unpack all of this so you're gonna take all this information and you're gonna catalog and document it might end up looking something like this in the end because we're not really using real white board your transcribing it from the white board you're putting it into a document like this and what you're starting to do again is is this this mapping of things and you're starting to see patterns of what are some of the main pain points what are some of the tasks that were common from you know ten different stickies from  you know ten fifteen people in the room clients and designers and everybody and then you start to come up with cool ideas and then you start to massage and polished as ideas and those ideas become features and then those features become use cases and they get broken down even in more detail and then you can document them and say this is how this is supposed to work in all these different scenarios so you know how does the welcome page work is it just one thing  can you do a few different things but you don't even get to the welcome page yet right now we're just figuring out what are some of the the the tasks that a person does what are some of the gaps that they experience within their day that were as we see it little potential for like mom this could be better and then actually identifying some opportunities but these are not solutions these are just gathering information I want to put a disclaimer on that this is not going to get you to  the the the solution at this point it won't come until a little bit later once you've had some time to unpack this information culture   okay so where are we here somewhere in opportunity somewhere in the fun part here so when it comes to solutions I was a couple things you guys said earlier so you talked about waking me up I think  so what could be something as far as waking you up as it is an alarm is it music is it what what is it that's waking I think it's a combination of music in in the tree okay maybe can be a daily mix where you hearing like I the tiger or something like that and then you're just seeing like people like this is a montage of people looking really healthy living a great life and and it just had a couple of quotes here and there okay  so it would not only with that motivate you to get up there and  and I was thinking like he's like no no no that's not as intense like that's a strong Waco buzzing in like a nice flu or something  have you had a flute looking you can wear and  yes  like that I guess we have different ideas of how to wake up and get motivated  when I get up you know  and  my version will my virgin sound like give me up in the morning  the night of the tiger Ono okay all right coming back to this so when it comes to the morning  we're talking about health and fitness right so yeah yeah these are things that would be nice wake me up that's that's related to my house I'm not you know frazzled when I get up in the morning showing me tasty recipes outs a great one what's something else in the morning we talked about that could be useful so  we said a few things earlier so just coming back to that  what something else they all you guys at all these wonderful ideas now is your time to shine now shut up you'll see well it's it's the challenging part because you you're at you have to dig in a little bit deeper than just the ideas that's where the gap park comes and you have to really think about like you know it also gets you to the point to to go back to that that person's question  sometimes you realize the solution youth you think is the right solution in your current iteration of something isn't and you realize all the people aren't even doing that that's not even a thing people don't take the phones in the bathroom for example that's just not a thing and you realize we have to rethink this because it's it's not really working with what they need or we have too many features right you get to a point where there's like you have ten features and then we go back to hold  these kind of feature matrix where we're doing short term medium term and long term things and really scoring those and that would be like another step after after that so so what what section are we in right now we're in the opportunities the future opportunities are we still in the morning or in the afternoon now we can move to the afternoon if not I will move into you say let's ask the community here on Facebook on you too what kind of opportunities are there are based on the the the previous two steps we've done  so we can come back to that if we want to have a quick look here previous two steps yeah those great when you review and then we'll we'll give our audience an opportunity to then gather their thoughts yeah I won't read through every last one but just right some interesting ones here in the morning  packing your Gen Bragg  Jason meal prep possibly and getting ready for work afternoon you're managing your energy which is an interesting one we talked about  match member the mood kind of thing you mentioned as well  getting coffee you're sitting at your computer  here trying to get home you're planning your work out of your having a quick snack  maybe you're meditating at some point before you work out as well and so some of the gaps we looked at was you know challenges are waking up in the morning what do I eat knowing what the weather is knowing when traffic is this visit to my day which is why I can see why some people are asking does this turn into a personal assistant  but does this play into you know your mental health as well as your physical health because I feel like when your mental health is is solid you feel more motivated to do things and so I think these two things interrelate maybe not as like boom boom one to one but maybe in a in a roundabout way  no  knowing when to stretch my moods my energy level  not you know being necessarily monitoring my calories   as I eat throughout the day  we can going back to motivation and not feeling inspired to work out and going back to knowing when to stretch which I just realize we have twice suggestion yeah what about a good meeting in the morning just to make you feel good that first to good morning yeah  and it's   the like maybe the whether it's seventy two degrees so sunny and you know get ready to start the day you know just something happy yeah okay  happy morning greeting  current  it's interesting to hear everybody's versions Chris once fire and fire and guitar solos  and the US something wasn't it yeah yeah baby stuff so custom custom morning greeting I like that that's actually more maps to maybe  yeah yeah yeah in the afternoon  kind of a what we call this like a mood  Chris how did you describe it  and Tyrese to measure your energy level  mood diary right like maybe there's like a five  five options like how you feel today after what you ate what you ate and it remembers what you ate so okay pumped I'm not feeling so great so that's  that's kind of a  a questionnaire almost like a check in like a mood check in as well so they  diary but maybe a mood check in something like that  how are you doing this I want to prepare Adam for the way we're in and the show he's going to write a custom song for us that's gonna help us wake up in the morning and he's  our next week yeah you got that so many sometimes amuse yourself work out you too man yeah  who's who's is user who is the appealing to who he adds up to him okay the flint he can say good morning it's seventy two and sunny today because  in California I can be like let's get up yellow is due is it's up to him  now I you know that the term calorie checker makes me think of like you know  old school weight watchers or something like that I don't really like that term so so if it's something that's that's kind of  maybe maybe this this app could come with you know a Fitbit or something like that it's not maybe it's not the Fitbit at maybe it comes with the watch or something that that lives on you that's kind of tracking maybe your movement maybe it's a movement tracker we talked about knowing when to stretch so let's add that when there but also when it comes to   calorie intake so how to how would we want to would you want to know that would be something you'd want to know sars a potential opportunity as if an app could do something which you want to do that  and I'm hearing the main thing from this up that I'd like you to do is manage my mood somehow and then give me a like a work out routine that's like a month longer something keep me on them okay if I had those two things I think that we go okay   Chloe has a good suggestion here she's I get it maybe there is an onboarding wizard that allows you to customize our options like how how how intense the energy levels are you you  drill sergeants are you one of a kind grant  yogam on something like yeah yeah  so there's there's a if that's a feature right yeah that could be a future yeah yeah and some of the glowing they have not gets the features  love a level of intensity   of work outs I guess is what we're talking about yeah or  or of coaching I guess within as hot coaching and maybe there's some kind of built in pedometer or some activity monitor so it's going to remind you you Hey you know get off your **** we've been sitting around for too long write something like that yeah gives you enough and they can give you a couple of badges the rewards for hitting certain milestones we can give the finest little ma'am  since we want to work with other workout burrows in Erin's par lance maybe there's a little fun competition where you're gonna see yourselves on some kind of graph in terms of what you're doing in terms of the end input what you're putting into your body and I'll put how many how many calories or how many miles are moving yeah so this game if I make the social make it fun yeah  and so let's talk about the evening a little bit so we talked about shopping list for my recipes  we have some interesting things here related to the afternoon in the morning and we have some miscellaneous actually quite a few now talk about the evening some opportunities in the evening what is it that we want to know when it relates to health and fitness in the evening after my work out before my work out  hmmm  the work out routine that I'm looking down the barrel of a Brandon had a good suggestion Harry says maybe at the  syncs up with your watch in it measures how  how efficient you were while listening to a particular piece of music so it's going to map your work out in your space relative to the piece of music or listing to the sentencing   how we want to wear them but I want to call them as any it throws together playlists free or something mood playlist that goes back to moods again that's probably music calorie monitor something  something like that yeah yeah calorie play that's that's but it turned out I like it recording things for  okay that's like let me some badges  no no man bellwether brand is saying I totally want is out right now  that's how it should work now and so   what else do we have think where where a here getting into the home stretch yes let's get into the home stretch because we're all we're stretched out in terms of our ability to focus  reading them but I definitely see the value of doing this because I feel like there's so many ideas firing off in my brain right now like maybe it just plays music for me all day different songs on here I mean I just feel like I don't know about I have all these ideas right now yeah any  we were in person we would and and and a white bread you would just be to do writing up ideas this is the portion where everybody you know kind of there chomping at the bit right to to get to this portion but the other two questions have to happen because we're really mapping it to something specific of like we  we talked about I go to the grocery store or I I'm planning my meals are I'm doing whatever so that's that's  really what you're doing in this exercise and again it's it's like a zoom in and nugget of a bigger picture so someone is as great idea maybe it like puts together report that I can give my doctor you know I like check ups  check this out then okay let's do that let's let's well one more and then we I think we need to kind of wrap the show care in the home stretch a little I'm a little hungry and talk about this food working out  I'm motivated so Adam are you almost ready to do your thing because I'm a do the recap  I like some recap music Adam and then Blass's out to  and outro okay so what's the last one they gonna put up there  okay so what would you put up with a lot I can't really read it you have to read it to me  I would put up the last one I called it  report out to my doctor okay yeah all right so let's summarize this whole thing you guys are summarized in the cold you want to summarize what the intent of what it is that you're doing right now and then I will do my show recap yep okay basically the intent and thank you guys all for your for your thoughts and and different ideas going on so it was kind of fun to do this live  that the basic intent is to get to a point where you can take all this information start to see patterns and things related to mood so even without doing this affinity mapping affinity mapping is literally just taking postage and putting things close together that sound similar or whatever  mood was a big thing and mental health was actually more  conversation as to why you wouldn't work out as opposed to the actual act of working out once you get into working out urine flow it's fine to getting into the motivation  the the mood and the whole deal that that that was kind of a theme that if I was  it's kind of mapping this I would be like you know me you think about focusing a little bit more in the mood and then the other little extra work out related things  they're just a bonus and they're you know expected but they're not they're not the main point in what makes the app valuable for example  okay perfect  Nicole before I do the mental modeling recap here how do people get in touch with you I know there's some job opportunities of people want to get work so this is one of those rare channels actually we're going to teach you wear that hopefully entertain you but there might be obscene everything's made  no Nero how do people get a job and I can mobile phone I mean you can email us where you know you can email info at I come up with a com or you can email me and Nicole dot Johnson and I'm a chemical dot com and what what we're looking for is probably towards the the end of the year is  is potentially some you acts and you I interns and some senior designers and if you have focus and  you know  designing for like product design or issues in in automotive it's actually quite challenging and Los Angeles to find automotive because it's I was the more the Detroit's or you have a say in Europe and and other places like that so automotive experience design for automotive is types of things were looking for and again Nicole dot Johnson and I come up com perfect thank you very much so let me do the recap Adam are you in the house or you have to go pick up your kid I'm I'm I hear all right so can you give me some music like recap music something that's kind of not going to be with my voice  all of which got  all right so let's do it  the U. S. mental modeling recap here's what we learned the double diamond is about research discovery definitions design and delivery I wish the first research with the D. word because it seems a lot of plays  but mental modeling slips right in between those two between research and discovery and as we dove deeper there's certain things that we're trying to mentor modeling we're getting information  and I think there are six components to it affordances basically what are the users expectations simplicity how easy is it to use the military Iritty do we recognize it availability is the mental load the complexity of it what are we asking of the user in terms of how complex it is flexibility to have more than one way to do something and then feedback there's action and reaction so that we know we're doing something mental modeling's goal is to define features and use cases and the core components are three things task and basically we're looking at this from that day in the life of the user gaps where we're going to end his B. needs and challenges I think and and opportunities the future potential solutions and one of things that Nicole was doing was something called affinity mapping as on super complicated basically just trying to group similar things pass Lucien's and we're looking for patterns  the tools because you guys love tools and resources for you ex designer  aside from our wonderful researchers at the future dot com is to use excel  action  notion keynote on the gravel sketch in general as an assembly all right guys nickel I wanna thank you for coming on the show thank you for have a story  Aaron and Erica for bring it Adam  we're about to wrap up the show right so you ready gonna think about I think you were much like does this give Nicole a big round of applause  the main purpose of children okay here we go good things are tuning in we're out here Adam motivate me I want to go eat work out let's do this switch the gear do  all right so   being wooed  Adam yeah  in  I'm not  the  \",\n",
       " \"it is surrounded funny message to sister in this is Ben Barnes and this is almost every life ok all the one sheet this is why we take my love experimental design and put it together every episode we choose one baby take the movie poster by the time this episode is alien from 1979 directed by with iska storing sigourney Weaver Tom skerritt John Hurt Yakub Memon heritance panoramic write the design of a company called in Singapore some interesting quiz Posters for Star Wars the last Jedi Knight alien Covenant motor project will be hosted I wanted you seen the poster for moon mai how is awake and from hypersleep investigator distress call from a plane is the day of catching by ball on the plane A1 decrease IT Act 67 enough disastrous of alien 1979 this is a poster of that is Biomass is tightening is the medicine white yeah yeah right now it is the feeling when you get this is this idiot liveleak write down its Italy ominous feeling which goes does it movie you see this ad and its like cracking locate the text the economic which is really sorry this is even out the green spelling out in a glowing effect spelling in OpenOffice base something even without where Windows is the shape that indicated by the composition in the peace is an hourglass so you think can it slowly studying to crack open combined with this hourglass shape of the composition and is overflowing you just breathing Adidas eat to figure out something about the time is ticking that's amazing way I never I never apart the hourglass it all Abba like anbanavan you say I am looking at in it I like it stop you and that is your soul awareness and avayogi and explain the play fix poor when I go inside the alien spaceship there's always like you you like just organic extra every 1831 mixer motor repairing why the tip prioritised information alien is this page from keyboard sensor typeface that will attract also its track just shut up 5 with an attractive type write the space between letters is so uncomfortable again it kuch army education is like crazy but it's because it's the same time it is seen at the bottom of the peace so this whole composition disease is busy at the seeker not feeling not well about this poster 9010 will give some posters the Param credits like text and Black in the designer stores attitude status for this version I think I know why I'm a gas here because the composition of the peace in black is so strong and you get the hourglass shaped Eyes what's there in why did the call attention to me the layout and nothing surrounding it so that's really interesting Pawan Singh a to write is that the logo of the name is the name the phone in the bar and credit section seems to be of centre of the earth largest Rose that entire week asymmetry is centred symmetry of Amy Elizabeth techniques to enable itself this is can I like it look like a fire was like a description 5 things with design inside I want to come in this river basin in past posters this is perfectly symmetrical first six symmetry causes of conflict because when I sure way to work with water I supposed online to install again the country visited at this address on conserve fuel needed for the first you ask you question sister is used as you are talking about the thing is that I noticed is that the tagline in space no one can hear you scream very small as compared to you I think I'm really do I think that have first clients that's not attract so much attention Infinity track from the position sizing is an acid is a good example of Hierarchy if you want to know that the sum is a bad thing you can I can only imagine read in space no one can hear you scream today you have hurt so you can I get up from it recruiter space no 150 screen and acquisitions things really done in the highest why is that they are likely in a day before you in the same way they like you doing for others like small red version smoke what was the spaceship in my cutie or back by NIOS 10th cost of a basic you have domain and that that tell me all about the film in the personal it's time for you now Anna Hazare the name and if you some reason watching this video I am so sorry bolaji badejo who is the person who played the alien with graphics he was 71854 Delhi and he had synonyms with perfectly allowed him to set what privileges greedy dog budget of the storm on the strength of business card storyboard over the message space journey what are the most memorable kisses some of the best cigarette on according to catch fire and everything about him in the post admit now it check the Powder that focuses your eye on the actual content of the poster is reminiscent of what training technique is the head of French play some people this was in episode of the 10 worst when I get the Priyanka instance master Yevadu film in aqueous new design thanks so much for watching if you like it but I like and subscribe if you not subscribe already what is now if you like this method section for well because we would like to continue making my show for happiness all right Hey everybody  it is  I don't even know what it is  from the top  Hey everyone my name is Stuart Shuster and this is been burns and this is a little show we like to call the one sheet  this is where we take my love of film and Ben's love of design and put the two together every episode we choose one movie take the movie poster of it and break it down this episode is alien from nineteen seventy nine directed by Ridley Scott and starring Sigourney weaver Tom Skerritt in home John hurt Yafa koto my man Harry dean Stanton and Veronica Cartwright the designer was a company called insync plus some of their recent work includes posters for Star Wars the last chat I login it comes at night alien covenant the Florida project in another movie poster that I want to do soon the poster for moonlight  those of you who don't know what alien is about the crew of the space ship a strong  is awakened from hyper sleep to investigate a distress call from a planet that they are passing by while on the planet one of the crew was attacked which sets up a chain of disastrous events  so alien nineteen seventy nine this is a poster that is  actually almost as frightening as the move it so I  oh my god you know before you sent this to me I'd never seen this man and this put the the movie in a whole new light yeah yeah it's very ominous yeah yeah gosh well looking at this poster I can tell you right now it is absolute it's just gorgeous the feeling that you get when you look at this is just you get slightly creeped out it's a it's an eerie ominous feeling which goes just it's perfectly aligned with the movie one thing I notice you see this egg and it's like cracking okay the texture of the egg kinda looks like the movie which is really neat so we know that this is even without the green whose spilling out and the glowing effect spilling into the egg we know that there's something up it's this is like a space kind of ag because there's something wrong here even without that we noticed that the shape  that's indicated by the composition of the piece is in our class  so you've got this egg kind of slowly starting to crack open combined it with this hourglass shape of the composition and it's almost like you're just waiting on the on the edge of your seat to figure out if something's about to happen like time is ticking that's amazing way I never I never thought about the I I our last name ideal ever like and but now when you say and I'm looking at it and I see it like if if it wasn't our last that would be where the sand is going down it's dropped IT there and that the war right there is you know sort of reminiscent of the organic floor on the plan  that they go to explore when they go inside the alien spaceship there's all these like really like just organic textures everywhere right now and that actually even makes it more creeping he had her a there's there's nothing not creepy about this piece but I I also want to call attention to the way that they've prioritized information  alien is this big chunky bold sans serif typeface that's really tracked out and so it's tractor this this truck that type but then there's trucked out type right so that the space in between these letters its soul uncomfortable that again it just put you on the edge of your seat because you're like it's almost cringe a little bit but it works it works because it reflects the same kind of with that scene at the bottom of the piece  so this whole composition is is this bizarre theory the edge of the seat kind of feeling and that's what I love about this poster  nine times out of ten when we look at film posters the bottom credits  are alike text on black  and the designers chose not to do this for this for this version I think I know why I'm gonna guess here because the composition of the peace in black is so strong and you've got the hourglass shape I think that they box that in with white just to call attention to only that lay out and nothing surrounding it means so that's really interesting to me  the one thing I don't like is that the logo or the name of the  the name of the film in the bottom credit section seems to be off center a little bit  that just throws that entire lake  symmetry that centered symmetry offer me and countless there's a there's a bit of text next to it I can't tell what it says but this is kind of like it looks like a client was like Hey we got to add a description there next to the logo  so that kind of feels like one of those last minute client things that the designers like  I don't want to carry on with this over a little bit but we also talked about this in in the past posters this is perfectly symmetrical and that perfect symmetry causes some conflict because we're not sure where to look  what what are I suppose online too in cell again that contributes to that bizarre edge of the seat uncomfortable feeling that you get from the poster yeah  let me ask you a question  I was looking at this poster is your as you were talking about it and one of the things that I noticed is that the tagline in space no one can hear you scream  very small  as compared to literally all the other tight on the poster  we thought about that I think it's a higher key thing I really do I think that at first glance  that's not gonna tracks so much attention it's gonna detract from the rest of the composition so I think it's a I think it's a good example of hierarchy if you want to know what the film is about then you're gonna come to lean in and read in space no one can hear you scream  you know like so you can have to lean into it to to get that from it they could have blown that out and just like made this the whole post  in space no one can hear you scream and then I think that would ruin the compositions I think it's really artfully done in the higher fees choice yeah I love that the way you said that you have to like lean in and it's almost like they they pull you in in the same way that like you're going through those like small corridors in the film you know the small corridors of the spaceship and like you feel that like you know  tents claustrophobia it's like you have to lean into that that piece of tech yeah I read it yeah I know and you feel that tenseness yep yeah that was all about the film and the poster now it's time for did you know Stewart  I'm gonna Paul dies in advance because I'm gonna murder this person's name and if your first some reason watching this video I am so sorry but  blue eyes he bought by day whole  who who is the person who actually played the alien was a graphic designer  well  he was seven feet one inches tall  day and he had a thin arms which perfectly allowed him to fit in the alien suit what  it's pretty well  yeah they can in the standing desk sitting down my gosh holy smokes  fox agreed to double the budget of the film on the strength of Ridley Scott storyboards alone  the massive space jockey one of the most memorable set pieces from the film was accidentally destroyed when someone left a lit cigarette on it causing it to catch fire and burn down  says everything about the film and the poster now it's time  friend now let's check the border that focuses your eye on the actual content of the poster is reminiscent of what framing technique is a hit it's French  thanks everybody this was an episode of the one she show where Stewart and I get to bring our interests and smash them together store with film and of course me with the sign thanks so much for watching if you liked it that like button and subscribe if you're not subscribed already let us know if you like this in the comments section below because we would love to

       " \"YouTube the  Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of the one sheet I am Stuart Shuster this is Ben burns and that this is the show where we take our two interests of movies and design and we bring them together and we  talk about movie posters  this episode is going to be about a movie that a lot of people love I love it  hello to  like seriously for a second there when I looked at your house like I don't even know if you  I could be wrong I don't know okay so anyway the movie is Jurassic Park nineteen ninety three dress apart was directed by Steven Spielberg and it stars Sam Neill Laura Dern Jeff Goldblum in one of his best roles the way way way before we do another one can I just   Richard Attenborough Joseph Mazzello Ariana Richards Samuel L. Jackson will go on to you but and way night you might be asking who's Wayne knight  me remind you hello  hello Gerry    this poster has a little bit of a weird story because I I really did like a lot of research on this and I could not find a  a designer for  poster it was an executive decision by Steven Spielberg that landed the logo on the film poster is the primary way of advertising not just the film but the inevitable merchandise that would follow dressing park is the story of a group of scientists who are invited to a mysterious island by a billionaire probably Jeff Bezos only to find out that the that that billionaire has been using his money to resurrect dinosaurs by harvesting their DNA from foster so  Ben burns  this is Jurassic Park I would love to hear your thoughts  I love this poster I I honestly don't see anything wrong with this poster I mean at compositionally it is so simple that when this was in theaters next to all the other early nineties flicks I think that this probably popped off of that wall just due to its sheer simplicity now compositionally what I think is is genius is the the use of symmetry a lot of designers and a lot of visual creators Hugh symmetry to communicate conflict so you'll notice like the scene where Darth Vader is walking up the stairwell in Star Wars is perfectly symmetrical and the reason why it causes conflict is because you're not really sure where you're I should line up because everything's so perfectly in the center and so I like it because it calls directly get up the hierarchy is so super clear on this you want to look at that logo all day long and everything else is secondary so I I'm just in love this I love this poster two and one of the that the I think  the main reason that I love it is because of its simplicity the fact that there is there's actually a number of alternate posters that you can if you look up online you can see these they're very standard like the faces of all the main characters war the big the big gates at the opening you know welcome to Jurassic Park or whatever but what I love that they did about this was they took  the simplicity of the logo which obviously if you've seen the movie is stamped on everything rain Jurassic Park lunch boxes tee shirts the jeeps that they drive around in its on banners hanging outside of the thing is everywhere the way that people advertise the park in the movie is the way that the movie is advertised E. and I think that's sort of like a flash of genius in a way I don't know that that's ever been done before no and actually this is actually the first time that the views this concept of meta branding where  in the park in the film this was the parks logo and so a lot of times a lot of these films you'll see that the film has a logo but it's not represented in the content in the story line of the film and so this revolutionize that meta branding kind of concept and it was a genius play when it came to merge the Stephen you did good man did good but here's the kicker  I want to also talk about  the poster that they did for the twentieth anniversary rerelease because they went a completely different way with that okay so here we have the complete our  that way of going about that you still have the logo but you have the gate which we were talking about before you have the jeep you have you know the jungle outside in the background the light coming through the gates and this is very reminiscent of some of the alternate posters from the early nineties that they ended up not using for the original release and in a way like I personally feel like this is a much less effective poster or would have been a less effective poster for the movie at that time the just logo right well and there's some there's an obvious difference here if we put the side by side the original poster is obviously very symmetrical but what I like about it is you got this really strong red on black and that sets the tone for the movie right you have this kind of deep crimson that represents all this come out anger and blood in it juxtaposed on just a sheet of darkness just a just a campus a black AC this campus of unknown if you will Zach Lee right  so if you see this poster you guys are driving into the park and the park is like a beacon of light and said it's just because it's like a weird like what is this like what will that mean are we driving into the future we walking into the light it's sort of like a dissonance yeah thing yeah yeah not to mention the really corny three D. extra type at the top and me come on really  one thing I found out about in my research  which I found really interesting I'm just going to throw this in here when they were designing the logo for it they  Lee  made the palm trees at the bottom very small to emphasize the size of the T. rex gives a little context yeah right that that's that that's a hierarchy that we keep talking about  I think it's fascinating if we go back to the old one Jurassic Park the original revolutionized the use of CG in a in a feature film  you don't see that on the poster  they've chosen to stay simple and I think that that restraint see it it just speaks volumes so it's very super impressive that they're not gonna lean into the special fax even though they're amazing they're gonna stick to what matters and that's the story story the park the story the brand yeah in the March  yeah they they have they have created something that it has become iconic Jurassic Park on black that's it you know that's all you need and I mean I honestly like I feel like this is one of those things where it's like there's there's like that one dude in the conference room who's like put it on black we're done  weekend everybody  either that or they walk in and and all that is is a is a look the logo on a dark slide and they're like well I like that and the designer sitting there like I haven't even started the presentation but cool yeah this is it  I have that idea  so that is all about this poster in the movie Jurassic Park now it's time for did you know Stewart  alright here's a couple of  axe about Jurassic Park the man out of them  the two in this is the best one the T. rex  would occasionally malfunction during the rain causing it to turn on by itself and scare the people around it  well that was actually me any longer when I was when I was looking at  my god another little facts about the T. rex the T. rex's scream is actually combination of dog pain when tiger alligator in elephant sounds  whoa  the glass of water that signifies the arrival of the T. rex by its rippling actually had a guitar string under the glass and wind plucked would make the water ripple  director Steven Spielberg started on Schindler's list right after principal photography on Jurassic Park finished which meant that he was pulling double duty editing Jurassic Park while shooting Schindler's list after he finishes Schindler's list and Jurassic Park he took a four year break which was unprecedented for him  here's one of my favorites well interesting tidbit Sean Connery was actually originally offered the role of John Hammond and Jim Carey was originally offered the role of Ian Malcolm can you imagine Jim Carey is Ian Malcolm now  no  no no love you Jim but   did your bottom  now it's time for a knowledge check  the words Jurassic Park in the original logo  are they custom or are they established typeface let us know in the comments below  thanks for joining us for one more episode of the one she this is the show where Stewart and I get to bring our interests and smacks in together store with film me with design and if you like this hit the like button subscribe and let us know in the comments section below because we would love for Chris to let us keep the show going  we'll see next  \",\n",
       " \"Hey everybody it's Chris around here with Jose and we're gonna be talking about US design how do you turn you X. design into a website is what I want to know I think that's what you guys want to now so we're gonna roll with that stick around guys because again I want you guys to listen to me yeah I designed sandwiches my name is so sick I yet and I talk about the business of this is  a lot of stuff my name's Cristo and talk about the business of design at the center of this operating system to understand as a  just some of the show title is I hate you did you were watching the process  we got a couple  we hope that they're going to chime in  so what exactly is  got it so the question is what exactly is your child read the question down read it out and then put it you keep going  so one of the challenges in defining you access simple as that  I was using the metaphor of a film when you say you know what a film as people think of the end product which is you know moving pictures with music and dialogue in this emotional how when you say filmmaking which is all the components are going to film making things like you know  the cinematography that that that set design the script be  all of what what else casting cascine what else you guys are direction production design book bags storyboards all the facts all those things collectively our film making  so when it's the process so you X. describes  a collection of activities that you do in order to create primarily in digital devices  experiences for users which is what people call somebody who uses a digital device so I everything from research to  to the actual definition of what you're doing to customer profiles to the actual design of that you I have the user interface itself visual design  user testing development all of it falls under user experience now user experience design the actual definition of a user experience  is what we're going to talk about today talaga answer yeah excellent  Chris the goal we want to do today and  I think your screen is actually working  is too we're working on a real project so we're going to be working on the school's website to school rocks all common put that yeah so if you can pull that up and what I want to do today is to take  the the user profile so we have and we're going to talk about them briefly and then we're gonna start sketching out a home page and I want people to understand because I'm gonna talk it I'm gonna do it out loud I'm actually  talk to my process so that people understand how I'm taking those and what it is and I'm doing with with the customer profiles in order to get to that so this is the current China and Japan side  so we've got we get a lot of compliments on the side and on what what it does we also get a lot of questions about where can we get your product missile tiny link this is shop we also have a lot of disparate sites and a lot of different things that we're using  so folk assets as founders Chris one of the goals that we're trying to accomplish why we re doing the actual website  we're trying to a communicate our product more clearly yeah  also trying to identify who our customers are we need to speak to them directly and solve their problems can if we can do that hopefully more people get interested in the products and the things we're doing so what he said is that he wants to fine tune and what I what I want to do two is fine tune what we're saying to our actual customers so we're discovering more and more who they are more specifically and then second we want to really highlight our products so that we can sell more and have the business increase in terms of  that the financial aspects of right because it then today we believe in the product that we are making building in developing and we want to make sure that the people are audience that were speaking to understand what it is that we're doing because if not there's a disconnect and then they will see the value great so let's start let's start with that so what we're gonna start with this too let's do two customer profiles  that we already have really seen from all the feedback and all of the  work that we do online meaning the interaction that we have with people who are those two  an error and you know who they are  who are they the two could primary customers that we have right now   the freelancer  and  what else   the Asians are a lot of gaps  and I want to do something that's truncated today because what's interesting is that  in how we do user experience we define a customer and a story  the demographics the story what their challenges or obstacles are and what their needs are in order to meet those but let's just distill it down to those two things that's distillate to if it's really basic like if we were to do real quick up here just the name and age and then the only two things that I think would be interesting to do is what other challenges  so what's their story like what's your story morning glory and then in order to meet those challenges you can column solutions you can column needs you can call me whatever you want let's actually column solutions just for fun just so it is really specific in how we do it in our product called core we call this needs Chris because it's in the slightly different but it's all the same thing here's their story like what's the story of this particular user all right Chris so let's give an age how old is this person we were here once early thirties early thirties so thirty three sure okay mail we have built up a whole profile now we're just gonna give you my name ten three letters them with the college ten ten Carson making that are very  right and that he what what are the challenges that he's having now we're basing this I'm gonna get back on camera here we're basing this on you we're basing this on what we're seen every time that you buy a school product ask you specifically I email back and say why did you buy the product what towns are going through if you bought one that is on the comments in you most of you let's say ninety percent answer question what are the challenges are going through Chris  challenges are going through is there there transitioning from being a freelancer works for other companies to having their own clients and what they want to do is graduate basically from working out of their home studio into having office and having some employees that could be an intern or maybe a junior designer Parcells person they want to wear out and need to grow because at this phase in their life at thirty three there's there either merry war about to have a kid or something like that and so their financial needs are much different today than they were when they were in their twenties  after doing  and and there's one other times and they were always pose which I had and you've had when you're doing digital projects what happens when the digital projects get bigger it becomes an wielding I'm wielding they become complexity and pain so people are really scared of it my way scared of it and the reason I start I I really think the schools what we do is important because it's all about the pain and I think one of the challenges they also have is there they wonder is there a better way what can I do this better  like how do you get from doing five to ten thousand all the websites to forty fifty a hundred two hundred thousand on the website so they can see  well and also and also be able to track their clients I love that so so so growth complexity is there a better way and I will call it also big major clients right so this transition real quick into solutions  what our solutions or what do they need in order to be able to and I like what Cristo talks about where it's like **** for tat so they can you need to translate this term by the way **** for tat is my turn okay transition from small to larger what is he needs to grow what does he need for complexity what does he mean is there a better way what does he need like can we say what are the things that the solutions for those problems yeah let's go let's go let's go all right so the first one I said and you guys enjoy your time and all right Archie what if you need in order to transition from small to extra large what do you need to get your practice to be bigger  its clients  the sales on our clients source yells process the ball great awesome thank you so much sales process appreciate that  and  attention if you're watching this pay attention to my languages I'm facilitating because your job as a designer to level up is to do the same thing I'm doing so I say thank you very much great awesome idea give me another one go increase is mine and what we time I know what it takes to grow and to increase sales process what else does he need to grow ten Carson ten needs to  this is a tricky one we had this call the other day we had this call with with with man we have this call with  at least and they are told us I can't remember what what other things is how do you generate enough lead to like what are the activities that you can do I need to marketing to grow outside of your sales process it is a little bit because marketing as a lead Jen it's but it's in there let's highlight it I thought I was under the same umbrella that's what is one thing okay so yeah so marketing we want to okay okay that's a really good point  one it's sometimes better to be more granular sales process might be too broad okay so let's call it  marketing  and promotions correct  they're slightly different but I like marketing promotions so for complexity in pain it is a good job  get John Cristo where you're also makes them feel better about  I know you didn't get a lot  we appreciate it all right so it's an excellent offer complexity in pain what it what does he need what what would you need in order you been doing web a lot or shop if I hire more people lasting for me  okay that's a great one so what do you need in order to hire people and to put him to work  able to manage  and it's already maybe on like maybe the weights on my so you need to hire and manage people okay so hires  and managed teams okay and what in the fear is that it gets painful with that says let's just leave those three and I just don't you need to be able to manage complexity in pain that you need a clearly defined process data with the client perfect alright you Chris so you're welcome thanks I feel validated for  your process  awesome so just with those three let's just do this exercise just with those but one thing that that I wanted to point out and we can do the is how are we doing on time and we could do that another one real quick so we do agency how hard the agency problems different is a person gonna be a little older maybe a little bit let's do a thirty eight thirty eight and female male as well and  Ellen Ellen that's a good name now and   staffer look great  excellent so let's give her some challenges what challenges does she have  and if you have challenges out there or if you can relate with the youths profiles let us know in the comments what are your child as well which is a good out of thirty eight grown an agency I mean I had some of these you have family responsibilities  you have partners now  you probably hit a ceiling and you're you're you're trying to figure out how to get the next level so maybe your three to five people and what started out to be a great ramp is now kind of petered out and sub plot tough yeah you hit a plateau he spoke  a U. T. H. I'm gonna be like that Patto did  in sales are in size in size so you have a certain amount of projects cash flow I've heard that like how to manage  cash flow what else  it's not that different than what Tim Tim going through and that he is dealing with particular products and he need to grow up he needs to grow they just need to grow with even bigger projects it's just a similar problem but just on a different scale are different scale but also their overwhelming because it's so much now that they're they used to be designers another being managers so in a way that the the the they're overwhelmed so managing over one or managing  which is with those three managing  overwhelmed with this space as are getting bigger think you have a low a bigger player so it's much more competitive competition  so this is where you competitions where you begin having to do things like you need to position yourself within your competition  to grow and then managing overwhelm is also about a system my station sis  nice station so now you have a bigger kitchen so many solutions all right so what are some solutions for this  again we call this means  there's other ways another thing there's a tons of ways to name these categories and there's different ways that you can learn how to do this all of them are really about identifying who the customer is what the challenges are and how can you solve them and then creating a user experience based on Chris let's just throw three solutions real quick okay so what we're talking about maybe similar they could be dissimilar what's the the solutions to my tone size one size cash flow problems manageable one system the station competition for cash flow contract structure can help solve that  right you can get paid more frequently and  after payment schedule bigger  have delivery and delivery payments plateau in size that means that you need to grow your  projects sizes with what is I mean in order for me to charge more what I need to be able to do it up to them to higher value higher value higher  so that's really sales sales  tools and like for example this thing decks and that's also positioning  it's a big one  what about what corner and out  and and and and I'm using a fairly thick sharpie even didn't get it to be thick enough I I need to I wanted to get the really thick one and that's because it needs to look good on camera but also because of your in  in a room people are going to be way over the room we want everybody to see this and to give you approve on this all right let's just take these here's a big thing once you have a lot of these and you might have ten of these because there's ten people in the room I might have you know ten of these what do you do next privatize privatized  I choose three completely arbitrarily here's why at the end of the day you can't necessarily build everything you want actually really final things through priorities you also want to push people to choose priorities it doesn't mean that the seventh wanting an answer to be addressed it means that if we have to cut it and we go back and say look you selected these various parties is okay and this becomes part of the next phase that's why goes into scheduling we you you about when you say arbitrarily you about you and about you say like what seems like the most pressing challenge and solution that we can provide and then we would see like everybody seems like in being agreement the top ones always easy number two is pretty easy the third one coming on that's where the facilitator may come in it's like I'm here  these two things I think it's for this and then you got into the process K. yeah it's like a hot option is like okay whose most for this one  okay all right so now let's go on to choosing let's just  choose to per category even the three is a good one so out of  the story challenges and it's Chris and I were let's say we're all here transition from small to extra large totally  one of the big things  complexity in pain is there a better way growth increase revenue these are similarly source similar complexity in pain what would be the next most important one  in terms of their challenging yeah  well the transition from small to extra large is a big broad topic yeah so that's probably when you say let's get more granular we should have done that because we were at four five so what's it what do I think the transition point some of them here so let's say the transition is the main priority  so it's basically this let's just let's just consolidate battle kind one  I think let's just used let's use growth and complexity so what I'm doing is as a facilitator for the sake of being able to move forward I'm saying the top two that we have here which is the transition to growing our growth and complexity in pain we're gonna use those to  as  the main ones been here basically we would have marketing and promotions a clear process it's a solution for this and this too  sales and marketing I'm consolidating them into one  it's not fair for everybody  yeah yeah okay so for the agency cash flow is a big one do we all agree both boom and then  I think so here we have complexity in pain here we  composition yeah exactly that we're thinking exactly same thing so for the agency we're gonna address cash one competition so then solutions higher so this one  the the the person needs to contract structure and positioning are the solutions to those two great so they're slightly different and there's a okay to do that because now that if you're addressing it from here you're also going to dress for this customer so there's a lot of  push sometimes from clients to do a lot of customer profiles we need to do ten because we have all these different over customers at the end of the day you don't need to do that many because a lot of the needs get highlighted by one  baby do statistics you know that there's a sample size a smaller sample size well that's kind of yeah that that the more complex a site is the more profiles rebuild for something like this to seem to be just fine right yeah your billing one three is an airline  that's a lot different types of users right you still want to have true but you still want to archetypal primary customer profiles okay like for example virgin  I I mereka isn't for everyone it's for like young professional I don't mean it like that I mean there might be the mom of the professional planner the gal agent guy slice of their different archetypes between three and five ten or fifteen customer profiles in the speech tonight will be what I usually do is I might do them with the customer like new eight I've done this and then look at all of them and said what are the similarities and consolidated them into five or into three all right so now let's do this rain I mean we have one over here already pre cut but let's just drive again and you can do this in many many different ways  so what's the question Chris that you would have when it comes to Jose how do you deal with translating and now onto a screen  well there was a  to do this so I don't even know  okay do it so I'll describe a couple of things one the format like mobile or like web is really dictated you guys answer this very well by the customer actually so I give with this this is we need our goal is right now for two to our main site right up the score a second so the format is a website  and that means that there's a bunch of different already acceptable formats to select from so you do that from research and from preference all right so let's say you're the client Christian me other clients how do we want our website to look structurally  with me we wanted to be a long page sales page on like a long sales page one like in the film you want on it okay so there's not made a decision as to what kind of pages so that means that we have a hero mom like the top and then we're gonna have multiple modul sick on the sales process all right so let's talk about that and I'm gonna go over here and I'm gonna look actually some other parts of the process so the reason why all of this stuff I like to have it all up at one time is because when you have a team in the room in your facilitating if you have the definition of the brand if you have you know who the customer profiles are and if you have your business goals you can immediately look at all of them because you're actually designing designing live with your actual customer in the room sometimes you can be doing this with your team you could be doing this with your design or you could be doing this with your developers but if you're I I agree designer and graphic designer who's used to sitting on their desk in a dark room which I've seen this when I walk into some studios working on your staff getting feedback from a manager behind you know  your shoulder  this is not that this is actually everybody working together to come up with a design the design and this is a  and where does is this designers is just like a sketch on a piece of paper  in this exercise we have the things that they're gonna have us objections is this for me does it work and what is it exactly so in the sales process you're going to have this is to capture attention appear  this topic because that's what you see what's the next thing Chris gonna be objection ones which is is this for me this is the qualification  and in terms of this vision making what do we literally put into a sale site like this that we already have like right here well usually this next section is to self select audience yes you have to tell you who you are then you can say this is me self selection yes so does this sound like I'm a freelancer an agency if it does then I'm gonna keep going if not so basically is for the freelancer the freelancer  I'm gonna discuss it in like that real quick so for the second time and here is the agency  and what am I gonna have below it I'm gonna have what that means so I'm gonna have  the challenges so you're looking to grow you're looking to do X. Y. Z. so let's actually defined those real quick but I'm gonna talk about my process  up here you're getting the value proposition the value proposition is basically what is the shortest way for me to say Hey what are your needs  so if you look at these and the specific needs of  those are usually the value proposition meaning you could have the value proposition B. the challenge like what is the challenger having for example  grow your design business  I'm basing that on  so if I were to highlight a value proposition from here also we have been in the you know confidence grow is one of the attributes we have in our value  it when we did the brand attributes so its growth right  would it be fair to just test out about proposition  grow  your  design business  which is super simple  and click yes maybe so let let me just point this out here  as I'm reading a book on copywriting the headline is was a grab your attention got an appeal to the person self interest yes so a lot of designers make a mistake they just talk about themselves and I don't really care about you yes you can help me solve my problem I'm moving on to the next site yes so I'm a design business I want to grow great more detail this is what I sound like and this is what I look like right so do you want to do you want to  increase so here you would go increase  you know sales might be one of them that might not be the first one we try not to talk about the challenges okay so are you struggling to grow your design practice and  whatever else you've written up struggling to grow is to come our projects getting more complex and painful  is there but is there a better way boom this is the three entry points that you're gonna have right there I'm taking them directly from my customer profile into the copy so who do you have in the room and  we have a larger team yeah you know you're gonna have copywriters you're gonna have art directors again about the people I saw for the agency  casual competition positioning what are the questions that we're gonna ask you agency  if you  do you know heavy plateaued and you know it's like so  had hit a ceiling had hit a ceiling  the ceiling  process to complete it    it is a hardened up differentiate  between your competitors or something like that I have a hard time differentiating between our competitors   managing complexity managing  hiring matches the number one hiring and managing projects and managing projects okay so here was I mean the ceiling  how are you an agency have you had a ceiling   are you having a problem hiring and and  managing and hiring people and managing your projects so those are already questions yeah alright so in the third one here what we what are we gonna give them here  to order the objection to  was a junction to press well is this for me is this some identifying right right and then does this really work what is it exactly that means anyone maybe what is this what is this okay so basically this would be the solution I like what is is it alas okay what is right objection objection I you got me really interested not tell me exactly what it is so does it work   the question there however different ways to actually answer the doesn't work question you have you have testimonials you have what is you have  what is a call that product medical data metaphysical should prove social  for the  for that freelancer for the agency  for the for the sake of of  of arguments to two things a step backwards when you want to do the product last yeah okay so we're near last near last so  anecdotal or like    testimonials so here you could say marks  you can say I increased you know  my sales  by X. percent  you have a picture of the person and then here you have the support  I've been agency you know we reposition  and grew  our agency yada yada yada and after that form so you can change this model to different places but this is already basically saying here the things that I did and the incentive was saying here's a public benefits are here the benefits immediately having somebody I'll say it and Chris is  drying the people which is  as something that you can actually do in the that and the and the pro in the in the sketch I've been lucky but you can get really you can you can have a logo  so what else can we do Chris here so the next thing is does it really work as a for me what is it exactly now you get to what it what it is okay so what is it what is it what is it so here we can have the different products now we know what those are because we have them in the dryer those yeah so yeah so the product is a kit you gonna get you have two kids you have  agency kit and you have a core main strategy K. so there's a booklet  yeah  you can keep  no doubt drawn so so so so there you want to have what I call again to for tat so you have the two problems then you have some of it and you can put product benefits instead of testimonials there you put the testimonials afterwards you're going to have to actually test different ways of doing this landing page coming up with it is not a finite process so I am a graphic designer Chris is a graphic designer by training we didn't get taught this at school right did you get taught this is school not how to go from a customer profile all the way to copy like I didn't think I was a good copy writer even but what I heard Chris saying I'll do a testimony on Chriss be happy said as  before I didn't know how to write copy now I know exactly how to write to that particular customer and we all know how to read English most of us to at least  because of the customer profiles so in user experience what's the first word in user experience user user so everything is focused around this now again the reason why the process is set up so that over here with the camera over here you have all your variables like  your brand is who your way around is who your users are and what your goals are and then you move on to the center which is where you're actually sketching some of the solutions putting up the boards of your solutions and then on the other side you have the actual execution and I and I noted this to everyone to the audience earlier the reason why you have all three when you're developing software and we shall be no this pretty well why is that the you would have you would have the input the what you produce and the output all next to each other visually  you can reserve  allies exactly how it will look and like exactly  what are you waiting for yeah you can visualize everything and you can move with an entire team through the process and it's gonna change that's the reason why all these tools like stickies and Chris said you know at the beginning that you is because you can reposition everything  that's why I use these it's a living process so when you see it  Google an image of Google's design process when you see an image of a software company   and it has all the stickies and all these things and you know white boards it's because design is no longer about this idea of an end product design is now about this I look at that man Krista should do like life sketching at conferences so you have the two products this look awesome  beautiful metaphor like an iPad I had wrote that's really awesome nice job do that you should be it should be the designer yeah it should be designers on that so I'm gonna end with this quote from Steve Jobs creativity is just connecting things when you ask creative people how they did something they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it they just saw something some connections between things it seems obvious to them after a while  Chris well yes we can put it back to you you always ask me how what you know what's your process that you're going through  what did you get out of this this is even help at all  I think there's a big gap between these profiles that you guys build from using core and then not connecting it to that there seems to be a pretty big gap between you guys doing this and then doing that because they did a very good job of take isn't showing you exactly how we structure and it's all through the lens of the customer user centered design is all about  the user the customer and so some talk about yourself talk sometime I your software and hardware in less that's a question that they have that's a challenge that what hardware do use them talk about that but in most cases it's not this is where your skills and empathy are going to matter a lot yet to pay attention to what the customers want and need and the solutions that are going to solve that in phrase in a way that they can absorb the story what do what do you guys think reflect on they they may not know as a student right  I guess I was wondering so here you're focusing on one single page elemental  how user experience fits in with the rest of the design process websites including like the site's structure and like what other pages there are you know like how is are there steps that that might come before doing this landing page that are also part of the last second question that's the next episode we're dealing with taxonomy side structure  based on actual customer profiles privatization like what features are in it what features are out  planning all those things are part of it and you use a similar process can ask a follow up question to what you're asking  now he got his **** in the very beginning what's the structure of the site and in a couple years ago is multiple pages and lots of things to do at there has been a shift towards something that is kind of more like easier for somebody to use and is a story in itself and full to us by scrolling down it's very easy and can be driven by the client so there's nothing for them to get confused by call to action would be at the bottom here so each one of these things is a little store that takes him through  the customer journey and we we do the call to action so that  consolidation of one page yeah it's all on one page versus by that's necessary system though you have a link to go to the E. commerce store you have links to go to a landing page for the products so we worked on that  we shop and I worked on that on what's called the product architecture or it's called  in this case you know  there's a bunch of different departments vendors that we're using to build the site like different services so you have to actually define that a large part of that is functional bike okay when somebody clicks on by where do they buy we build any commerce page do we actually use the service so there's a lot of questions that dovetail with the technical so I'm collaborating with Rashad's computer science major  from UCLA and he and I are discussing the pros and cons of the platforms that we use and then we dry out like a diagram of all the different platforms that's a technical architecture issue now becomes what's on everyone of those pages so we repeat this process on each of those pages what's the format what needs to be on it the best thing to do is to copy existing formats in creativity that's like whoa you don't want to copy somebody else's work because he works about originality when it comes to function all aspects of a website there are things that are proven to work and you want to have those general structures take this structure you take the structure you can change the color you can change fonts concert all these different things going with the structure on a little bit but you don't want to necessarily be the guy who has this unique thing because it's not necessarily about how it looks visually as how it displays on a format like on a phone which is thing about car cars four wheels the steering wheel drive dear motor and it needs to work the same from manufacturer to manufacturer they're copying each other structure  everything else about the experience is different the way it looks the way it runs the way it sounds everything's different but we do have a problem with that and I'm glad you brought that up because designers like now I'm gonna reinvent the web limit web four point out this one designers thing and then they create a complete disaster doesn't function they spend all their time re engineering something they didn't need to be fixed  now the time that you do that is maybe there's new emerging technology  platforms you have to start thinking about that's the time to think about new structures yeah he had it on the net like response yeah now now everybody's on mobile devices and then you're designing for two three screens at a time so that's what's driving the function and structure thank you guys if you have questions about user experience ask below what other episodes about user experience you want to see what is a valuable topic  how did we do how are we doing you like my hat I don't know whatever you want to comment on below and what else should strive to like this video if you like it and comment share it and said we'll see you guys next time  \",\n",
       " \"Hey ready welcome to the process  Chris on a very special late night edition we are talking to you  Santos a woman with many titles the founder and creative director of several companies for at least four in county there are concrete commodity fruit and LA downtown Instagram because when we talk about branding how you can learn from it how businesses can improve their customer retention with branding in building personality stick around and tries again I want you guys to listen to me yeah I designed sandwiches my name is so sick I yet and I talk about the business of this is  a lot of stuff my name's crystal and talk about the business of design at the center of this operating system to understand as a  just on with the show title is I hate you did you were watching the process  a whole bunch of people I'm sure they have a bunch of questions and so the audience is been instructed to ask questions and there's no holds bar here with the show right ascend the beginning he's people aren't familiar with you yo personal you prefer yo and your full name is  well  your background is in Gotham design you went to art centre just give us a really brief history how did you get there  concrete started  but I did for my center and then went to work for a branding agency really quick two weeks then like it went to work in motion graphics for five and a half years and then wow happened to be lucky to  find out that the owners of pink berry are looking for an agency my friend told me about it I tried it loved it so I  pitched an idea that Saturday and then  got the project and then I quit my job and start her company nice now I know I happen to know the story so there's a little bit more detail and I think you to skip over some of it you know when I went to pitch the aid  the new business so she took some time off to take vacation personal days would you dedication time so she took some vacation time worked on her deck got the job and then quit and that's a pretty genius way of doing it minimize the risk if you can get it to my to quit anyways but who knows and the rest is history as opposed what is branding how do you define it  and maybe the most important question is why doesn't matter for businesses so take it away from me branding is very personal as a kid I remember my mom was a road shopping for toys and she said there's there's too but I would I want to let go so it is legal this box was tiny and and he's like he's China version and it's huge and it's the same price you can get this one or this one is and not take the small one says I can already knew all what brand it is like I don't know how to explain it but there's just something about it that's like visceral it's just got in stings and I am as I grew older I think teenage I remember I just love window shopping but I just love looking at items on the shelves and like asking myself why do why was I attracted to this woman I've tried to do this month eventually why I I wanted to do branding because everything is just instincts and it's like sometimes when you look at products you look at things it's like something is pulling your brain back and forth in your emotion but you don't know what it is it's all just like invisible dress and it's just so interesting okay do you know what that invisible thread is the forces that work  it's how a brand speaks how a brand  looks what it stands for and  how honest and transparent they are as a company  there's also have to be some aspects of like being good how the product itself to be amazing obviously it can't brand something that's just silly entirely you start with what it is in at the core which is the tone how does it speak the personality  the emotions that it's trying to get you to feel there's something that Simon cynic talks about in that we trust  people and companies that believe what we believe  so they're they're speaking tour guide and your gut doesn't actually have words describing you describe as in this thing and that's what they're tapping into the reason why you buy apple over another product or company even though they're more expensive and probably don't even have the best features is because you believe what they believe in or they believe what you believe in so you feel connection and that gets into the whole like tribes that we belong to if I'm a Harley rider of on the Honda guy aren't accurate guy or Mercedes guy it says something about me and the things that we buy say something about us right I imagine as a little girl you know one the off brand legal product because maybe you felt like it was counterfeit and then you would be a counterfeit and you don't want to knock offs right probably why you like brand name fashions certain things of that nature  even though they're similar products because you believe what they believe in yep okay and so can you amazing part of this is I'm really analytical I'm the opposite of you you do two things ins instinct in your gut and  motion in whatever for me have to decode it put into categories and put a wonders are next to it and so I that might work for a really long time and I've been reverse engineering it for quite some time so I wanna learn a little bit more about how you do what you do but before we jump into it maybe you can tell us a little bit about how it at least from my point of view  people use the word brand all the time I need a new brand but what they really mean is I need a new identity or logo  and how even big firms they were branding firm but what they really are they're not daily systems designer  the design the entire identity system color palettes how to roll out on airplanes in trucks and all that kind of stuff but they really don't do any messaging is M. branding  it's part of branding  I would say  that's one of the not one step below but it's something it's one of the channel one of facets yeah one of facets of branding okay so would so you say is one of thousands so I want to like a harder line answer like yes or no  which is the companies that design identity systems would you consider them a branding firm  no is watching the story now now okay  yes what no  well  I don't know  a lifeline yes our allies is when you guys  many designs amazing beautiful identity systems the some of the biggest in the world is that branding what's your understanding of branding is an arm a part of your body  is an army  with me  now how do I do now  no I don't believe locals are brands that's not branding at all it's a mark that any system  Marty Newmar's definition a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product service or an organization it's a feeling it's not a mark it's all of these things but it's not that thing so let's think about that if if I can do a public service for the world the designers please do not confuse a logo as a brand a brand has several voice of personality has touch points right because you're not buying the apple logo you buy everything that the company stands for and how did they do that they did that through things like  think different  when they show pictures of Einstein of Katie is the Kitty Hawk or I don't know the of of the Wright brothers the right brothers or Martin Luther king  people who thought different and we see ourselves as artists to go against  mainstream as non conformance that's why we identify with apple and for into they told you royally screwed up I'll be a Die Hard apple fanboy to the day I die it's all my kids let me here without a question then  people that have seen your work where where should they go to see your work  ferro concrete dot com or  alright yo Sentosa dot com in there they are there on the branding train they wanna get positioning right how do they approach as if I was his training methods and you even said this at the beginning of the show which was I wasn't trained to do this but somehow you figured it out so give us some tips as designers who want to elevator game from being not just an identity system is  higher but a Brander what do I need to do     I think you always have to start by understanding  who they're trying to target what's who's a customer  and and really understand what do those people like how what are their hobbies are what individually attracted to knowing all those things it's almost like for me with with the way I look at branding is you're just a match maker you're trying to make two things falling off of each other so if you if your check if you're you're creating this person whether it's okay I'm saying this is going to be a girl she's gonna be bubbly optimistic she's gonna talk to you like this is going to wear stuff like this and you know you're gonna track these kinds of people so it's like for me it's as simple as that is like understanding how one person can you go out there you put them close on them you make them look good you say speak like this talk like this and then like talk to them about how they what they believe in and then make sure that they communicate that to the to the customer other person at trying to fall in love with and then if you're if that actually everything goes well then they don't fall in love with each other  together stellar I'll I got as far  so using the branding as matchmaking so you can't change the person the meaning the customer so you can only change the brand yes and you want to make them as attractive to the person and find compatibility so they can fit and so they can have this kind of glorious relationship  that's how you may  people fall in love  but so how do you do that  the new profile people the provider customers but how do you learn about who your customers are and how do you translate that into messaging colors fonts look and feel that kind of thing how do you do that it's usually  for it for me it's still everything is still starts with the words and  before it goes to anything visual so  I  usually the client would provide this is the demographic they're thirty five to fifty five or women are up and after that it's mostly for me it's looking online and reading what people actually say about the current brand because it gives me a lot of clues   when they say this is why I love this brand this is why I buy this thing it gives me a lot of clues and I'd pick out words from it upwards from it and  put everything in an email that's what I love to do and then and then I'll start putting in other thoughts on top of it make so this if he's  I tried to understand how I even work  specific than she is the first time ever  cool  it's not easy Jose summers in the exact same problem actually but it all but it all started for me it's all stars with boards just putting things together and then sometimes certain words are just like  it's plain Jane let's go to at thesaurus and say how many different ways can we say this words and then once you find a beautiful work you start thinking these beautiful it conjure up all these different kinds of imagery then you start looking at it so it's almost like a web process where it like a spider web you start with  words and then you come up with better words you come up with more words and you have a whole day to work and the idea is to simplify simplify simplify simplify there's no point in having up five page where documents at all what you want is a paragraph if you get a paragraph right and then it it actually inspires visual images out of that then then  I think you've come up with something that's all that  so even if it is something that I've not done myself which is you go and read reviews of the brand the product where you're going   family's Facebook on I don't know no no no it's more about how people talk about the Branson not reviews about the product but how people talk about the plan okay so if the client is say like adidas because I like adidas you would just go on Facebook look up the details page and see what is up with see what people are saying go on blogs what people are saying  go on  Instagram all those things  it's I think it's a lot about listening to what people are saying when they think the brand is not listening  you really basically just described Marty new Myers definition of a brand really it's a person's gut feeling about a product or service so you're reading this sentiment through Facebook or Instagram through blog like you said when they're not listening  because it doesn't matter than what the local looks like doesn't matter what the colors look like it's really depends on how people feel so that's one clue there that was great I love that now I'm gonna challenge a little bit it's my job  you said you look for words and you go to the to the source and you you want to look for a beautiful word what is a beautiful word to you   beautiful word  I think something for me it could be something that's ready could be something that's very visual certain words are very visuals like what visual  I can't think of right now chocolate I don't know  it's right there  because of his word as well okay yeah I mean this is about something that describe something there's just so many ways you could choose to describe the same right and then it's just finding what's beautiful within those things now are you you're a are you a native English speaker not now so you're looking up English words or when they would honor language you speak in the nation but only like now only to like ten year old grade in the nation so here's the thing I'm not a native English speaker and by looking around the room there's only a handful of people here as far as I can tell that English as a first language one thing personally that I find so fascinating about English is there's so many words to describe a particular meeting in so many new once ways it's hot it's tempted it's boiling it's all these words and choosing that right word that in your work parlance a beautiful word these these are things I talked about my students all the time and understand the difference between paranoia and fear  that's really to have the understanding and then to be able to drive it through an initial concept okay so now we know read the reviews  when the brain isn't listening  find a beautiful word Sundance we need it's visual that super precise and clear because that drives everything and lastly  write a paragraph that has meaning I'm tired of reading brand strategy from companies that you just  nothing is like a light fluffy cloud I can't do anything with it doesn't look like it is and sound like anything but for some reason companies pay a lot of money to do that it makes them feel safe the use buzz words so there's a warning for you right there if your brand statement is fluffy words that are just you know all on wired  under the buzzy marketing jargon that's a warning sign  it has to start to sound like maybe some mean something real yeah I'd be like a real person would say exam and has beliefs and that yeah that's great that's awesome I was really helpful anybody have any questions so far how do you handle when  a client may not understand  their own clients I'm sorry you know their their own customers and  also like when maybe they're probably maybe ten years behind the curve and you're trying to give them a future look and they're really based maybe two thousand twenty fifteen that's that's something we really struggle  great question so let me just restating case that didn't make the audio clip  how do you work with clients who may be behind the curve and don't have an understanding of future customers how do you deal with that because I'm sure our audience comes across that all the time  and this is a charge question so this one might explode on us so as to how yeah and the great Indian answer this so that these  is expressly over hers and hers alone   well it's always good to show and another example hits here here's a company who before the rebrand was this this big this much this many customers and here's what happened after the degree  event even though they they think they didn't need it but suddenly they all of the open up their customer base to this other demographic so it's always I think it's always people always like stories people almost like to hear success stories and if you can give some adults that  it relates to what the concerns are I think that would be helpful what you're saying is you need to have in part of your bag of tricks arsenal of debate case studies  this use in laws use everywhere business case studies so you can talk about it you you want to talk to business person you need to learn their language so what I would say Michael is let's not talk about graphics colors as that X. those kinds of things because things are highly subjective right you can show me something and you could say this is really cool Chris I could know it's not that so two thousand and thirteen and we can have a debate about it let's talk about real things here here's a very clear difference between two companies position in a very similar place target and Kmart  two companies are mass consumer goods one as a brand where you would go to because they have really sometimes quality design work Ford not anymore money now I remember growing up as a kid because we were poor came are like I didn't want to be seen at Kmart but Tarjei on the other hand that's cool right  so you need to cite case studies to help your clients understand in terms that they appreciate and usually the terms I appreciate his bottom line market share revenue new markets innovation so let's learn to talk the language of business has okay  our guide  some then short short I had a client same issue I bought the Harvard Business Review which I love they started leaving it in their magazine rack in the office  and eventually he started actually reading it actually it's described  and now he started telling me what he needed to do I don't even have to tell  what is that called that's like a Trojan horse inception when he needs to there is that inception yeah it is action influence influence he didn't believe me but he believes the Harvard Business Review it's always true guy you're getting paid to to give him you know this advice why did you not believe that's also some we struggle with all my god this is another show called on yeah  the great question though let me the great I think why pay somebody not listen to them I'll tell you why the second you know and there's a thing about credibility  Harvard Business Review you've heard of that school Harvard  who's like a baller  they could say the same thing  right and I had this exact same argument has a and like I say this in the future I talk and he's like no they said this famous person that okay you're right  I said the same thing I told you to you know what I'm talking about we will mention that but he's like yeah you're right just anything like that so a lot of it has credibility so when you say something from you it sounds like it's self serving  you don't have to take my word for it reading the Wall Street journal  reading the New York times  Dr X. Y. Z. from the  fortune two hundred nine hundred companies said this it's up to you now man  right so unfortunately as designers we've been trained to much to talk about design graphics and color and  kinds of things  you're losing that argument every single time I tell you that  as if he ever higher creative person and they do work for you they'll tell you your ideas are stupid that your old that you're laying the you don't know what the new hotness is right the hell that occurs passe wouldn't even argue with them yeah you just some dumb punk kid is going to tell me what this that XR but that's what you sound like two other person but let's move on we're here to talk about brain in my head of that okay  so I think we touched on this a little bit but tell me a little bit about your secret sauce how do you get brands personality secret sauce I did not  human personality make them fall in love with each other how that how well I'm I'm a boring commodity I'm a marker sell me this man I'm just kidding  how do you give this marker personality   well was it trying to track I don't know  please try to track people like Jose he loves sharpie what would you do how do you get a personality  I don't know you know I don't know  on the internet wants to know how do you do it maybe sure case study it could be something you've done or something you see in Europe Meyer because you're in this space we want to hear from you  I'd say Ellie downtown  Canada but yes you can okay let's just say this is a  so I mean I mean downtown for thirteen years this was before downtown was even like safe to live in not just save   but anyway so I've been living in downtown for that long and I've seen the  change that it has happened in downtown apartment there like popping up restaurants businesses shopping malls and and for me what was missing was  something that to give that downtown a voice that it's actually a cool place to live in that it has changed from when he was thirteen years ago that it's something you need to celebrate and so missed the point that was a that was the brief that was the brief right that's a that's a brief how do we design something like that first we came up with the name  I live downtown  we we came up with a few other name I can't remember what it is now but there's something about LA downtown there so simple it's memorable and sense of pride  so we we came up we went in that name and then the other thing is the logo we want what other names and to come up with I'm just here I can't remember right now not one not one it was just funny was instincts I've shot  I can't remember I can't remember if it's a man is right style yeah  when I'm really happy with someone's what I kick their care good job shadow  going to be here  giving a brand of personality to the name status with the name  starts with  of course knowing what demographic you're trying to track and then putting some words together what is it is it because it help is a culture is it influential is it are you a curator  but the personality trait together and then after that you start thinking about what would this person say what with this brand say and you'll start putting save this it's trying to say  one way OR one sentence and you do it in five six times in different ways like in a more we DO  in a more romantic way on and then suddenly something feels right and something hits does it what fits with the what you try what demographic your China  talked to and then after that once you develop a tone of voice you go into visual look and feel what says all those things let me pull it back and it's hard to talk about my process because I have no process  okay we'll probably added that out for your  well okay let let me just pick it up okay  because I'm reverse engineering all process right now okay so you said let's start with the name so how to give brands personality start with the name and you pick LA downtown  because it gives you a sense of pride and from the little that I know about writing copy when you write a headline it's supposed to be self selecting meaning the audience either says that's me or not me so you have to plant her flag somewhere inside this is what I stand for it's not for the west side I was gonna start newspaper called the Santa Monica west sider  hello and thanks right yeah so that that means you're either with me or you're not with me and then so that's great so names that don't mean anything like bubble Bob that's not gonna help you start with the name I also like this idea and you probably don't do an informal process but I will be doing it soon he tried to say something and you senator different filters what is the with the version of the romantic their sarcastic the hipster that ironic hipster and you try to see how that sounds now you have an example that I love  for pink berry is that is saying we open from nine to five how did you guys a startling daily he sees the open nine to five goes to what  kind of filter that comes out swirling daily  the fun but the act the right yeah did send to the  filters and it comes out  swirling daily I love that think about this this is how you start to do brand you guys take every dole boring thing that they do that sounds like a voice run it through the brand filters so in the case of pink berry it's DO which is bubbly find what else without a word energetic and probably find an energetic send it through  right sensei said interesting open exit park here don't do this don't do that centers that filter so now what I want you guys to do an audience everybody is watching on the internet is be more cognizant be more aware that when you're going through a store look at how they talk to you  really well designed hotels are very consistent so check out like what some of my favorite about the I'm not gonna mentioning brands we go check them out you'll see the one to do right take notice you can learn a lot from that  all right okay let's move on approach enough on a spot on that yeah  now we started a lot of companies  like almost too many companies you start with your design company these sorts of lunch other companies and be a be on the board of directors that kind of thing why do you start so many companies what's wrong with you  well I think  for one I am the type of person who likes to always likes a challenge and I I find I love living ready one design company is not hard enough it's it's hard enough attack no believe me  but I I'd like different subject matters and I love creating brands and I love putting people great people together and see the brand become something else become its own entity so  yeah I think it's as simple as that and and I think one of the first ones that hit me was seeing how amazing I when I would think that it at one store obviously that three three or four employees when I start with them at the time when we stop working with them they had I think over thirty employees over two hundred stores internationally and it was just so inspiring to see the whole process happened in front of your eyes after a while it was just I was just burned out and I wasn't doing my best at Vera concrete I was in managing food well and so it was that's a huge mistake like not understanding your own limitations as much as you you're passionate about it you're spreading sell to them ready myself too thin you know how well she learned that lesson she started to work companies  this is a good student no but but what I but I I did that differently where there's really good people in all right from the beginning whom I know all I'm not so much involved with it I'm pretty much like  this is where to go and have the discussions and like kind of guy did a little bit but it's I don't really do the day to day stuff it's crazy that brick and mortar in this day and age because you're dealing with overhead stabbed firing hiring H. are you deal with lots of stuff when the future seems to be happening online anyway yes tester idea out there several times in my career I've had the opportunity to  to close my practice down and go on the client side they've asked me to come join them what happened  recently  and I said no most of the time or I actually know all the time I've said no all the time have you had that same thing happened to yeah  I actually went through the same experience where   a client asked me said that the company to join them full time become the creative director and offered me shares in the company but at the end of the day I I felt it was   I will I'm the type of person who gets bored working on one Brandon one brand only and so part of the charm for having on my own sense it is to work on different subject matter all the time different brands and also one of the things that I really really can't give up is the freedom the freedom of owning your own business the freedom of the struggle every  thank yeah yeah can to work you work with your favorite people and it's there's a sense of ownership and pride and it's just it's just nothing no one and no amount of money can buy that I think  for me it's strange that you saw it as either or that there was no middle ground and the thing I want to talk about is just the power of negotiation and standing that you as a creative human being create a lot of value to the world and what sickens me now as an entrepreneur who'd been doing this for some time is that we just give it away we never said to think  the value has been created give me equity I have equity in the few companies and I've helped them and I contribute to their growth and and I want to part of that so we get into these discussions about will how many percentage of your company are you what do you think that this is worth twenty willing to give me so you don't have to say it's either this way or that way  right some just on it should have been my  business consultant  saleable  that's a big deal Kay I'm I'm relatively affordable  percent  yeah  if you do that with the expected remaining board with them but if you just I know it's beautiful I would define as global work we ask for a percentage plus money  because I get both I want money to cover my expenses and I get equity for the intellectual capital and I'm bringing and then we're done ever in my shares I keep doing other things right and if they want more work great let's talk about a retainer under prefer discounted rate everybody wins  because of the special but it could be the one you like maybe one of the  everything is negotiable you get to determine what works for you or you walk and if you were truly valuable truly and not just because you think your valuable your mom told your valuable then they would offer to you guys in  stand okay got it got it you said naming was important to you how did you come up with the name of concrete and what that means to you all ferro concrete was actually a simple story in it I was in school all instructors that come up with the fit make name for a big company and then I came up with ferro concrete because I love concrete and then it also became a metaphor for me for because there are concrete means when you put steel beams and you pour concrete into it so it in it's a technology that enables multiple story buildings and bridges and so it became a metaphor for building brands and describes skyscrapers  thank  he   so really what you're talking about is the the iron rebar inside concrete allows it to be much stronger than it is so your brand your identity I'm sorry is dexter the concrete  the rebar is the stuff that allows it to be awesome and strong yes yeah foundation I have I have I have a philosophy live you've heard this before as it is to make money doing what I love so if it's just do what I love it's not gonna work for me does making money not loving it not gonna work  so my whole thing is like I would love for you to redefine what you love redefined what I love yeah not you specifically not our audience like if you're here in image maker your typographers that's what you love so you make layouts annual craft things in Photoshop that's what you love  what if you were a problem solver for many years we describe ourselves as motion designers  so we're only looking for motion design problems to solve  and then my business coach Kerr said anyone watch episode this link here is that he said well why do you define yourself like that near an image maker does anybody need images  everybody needs some kind of a mention you're very good at it so certainly broaden out and so the broader I go now them to me the more valuable I've become and the happier I become but I know I'm like a weird dot in that regard no I'm okay it's very true because if you ask me what is what makes me happy  or what is the thing that I love when I first graduated I would say making me signing making that hands on yeah hands ocean proceedings that  and seeing it out there and then if you ask me again fire it it made me happy to start all these businesses and you've probably asked me ten years later what makes me happy is probably I don't know  cool  it's kind of this company does take it the people on the street and then we can wrap this thing up  is it hard being a leader yeah  the question and conclude yeah it's a really good question and sadly I am for me it isn't because I'm I'm not the kind of person who it really depends kind of leader you want to be and that kind was like Hey punch in a field folks shoulder and then there's another show there  but but I think my job is to really like inspired the team get them excited to be at work and get them I said about the project work well with each other and  foster discussions and just be kind of a guide not the type of the  you're late with  it just depends but for me it it's pretty natural because I think maybe it's because I'm the oldest get to I don't know but it's just comes naturally  I see yeah but I'm I'm I'm already bossy at home anyway   buzzing home nobody  what is it called the match dot com profile at the bottom here  if reloading brands of connecting people I want to connect yeah she's nice she's always making things and we are ready hindering me from going out tonight member there's a party tonight  the firm is made great lovers about this question knows you pursue any further education after  I think you  try to go into business or to try to learn how to manage although he sees that a graphic design I don't know how to run a business what you know about marketing or negotiations apparently not a lot not a lot and all that kind of stuff how do you know how to manage people how do you know how to become a leader those are not necessarily skills that the teacher in graphic design for them right now but it's those things that you couldn't pick up as you go and learn and actually it's not just the outcome is about the journey an experience that makes it fun and I learned a lot and meet people cry I've cried you know maybe it was a bad bus one day I don't know probably the alcoholics kidding I'm kidding  they always give me this is your reputation online  have fun  anyway well Hey so I I would like to jump in there we don't as graphic designers or creative people learn any the business skills and I think that puts us at a major deficit there's this thing in three hundred like okay I'm gonna help myself in terms of the total dork is fine Frank Miller three hundred  the night is young boys a spark  and and the tasks of becoming a man  don't be off in the woods with a spear and you have to survive there  it teaches you a lot only the strong make it back  so that's what she's saying like you're on the street you're learning from real people in real circumstances  and there are real consequences when you ask Bob somebody quits you get fired you lose money you go upside down you go bankrupt you lose at all where school you get in D. who cares  nobody cares and that's why it's like this is real now and it's hard it's a dog eat dog world  all right next question you have any tips or advice for leading a meeting with the client leaving a meeting with a client yanks that's a question for you I believe it's addressed to you but it's so how do you do it how do you do it's probably fun to be in meetings with him  it is well  tips I always walking here be always walking happy don't even if you're in a bad mood but anyway it's it's I think a lot of the times you walk into a meeting clients first of all they want it probably senior work online so you might want to show them something in it in the meeting if you want to go into something more details but it's mark mark about you getting to know them and how how much   you you work together and you can you work together as a team you get what they're saying so a lot do a lot of listening  and then  guidance thing and and talking with re read it read it read to rate I'll reiterate community  but yeah it's it's just about chemistry chemistry and then making sure that  you sell they work well in her answers a prize yet all was all about brands about personalities and history her answer will be it's all about your brand in your personality it is I have an answer though yeah you gave me just enough time to think about that yeah okay just  we do meetings all the time  and I used to be scared to death but during the conference call the fate of your company yourself your self worth everything hangs on the freaking conference call give the phone my boys  shaking like what I'm gonna do it's because in my mind there was this narrative as creating that was killing me that I need this job I'm not worthy there my masters and they get to anoint   is good and who is not good so every word I'm saying and thinking about four times before I say it and then I secure can say the words shoulder you know you know you say well here's the thing here's what I want to think about  you need to go to meetings  with extreme self belief confidence is what they call that right and confidence is not like I'm the best name drop this I've done this who are you that's what I'm talking about to me confidence is about being vulnerable and being transparent about who you are I find this to happen to me and everyone so I can check myself I go in the room and take  you know like if they only found out that I drove a Toyota I'll be ruined so the whole time I'm running around thinking please  anybody asked me about Toyota as a preparing lies about Honda's whatever it is I cradle narrative in my mind if I just walked in the room hand but I drive a Toyota it's on the open and I don't give an F. if you think that's cool or not I just don't care  so go into it being transparent say whatever it is you got a big hit but that was it just like I have is it and that's it and nobody can talk about it more  yeah I got a **** leg I got a bad knee I got a you know whatever just own it and be who you are  that's what's going to give you the confidence okay so in your mind he like flipped the  you don't need them  we need each other it was at the table I can do this for you  I can't and now we go to the next person and good luck with whoever you pick  so when you go into a room and I like to go in completely unprepared I don't know anything about them I don't do any research because I find that then I don't jump to any conclusions I I don't need to be the smartest guy in the room and I tell them a lot up front and only thing about you I just wanna learn some ask you a few questions and I'm gonna shut up and listen and I'll take notes and I'll ask you questions  that's really refreshing for people you know so now I'm endearing myself and I'm like wow this person isn't gonna give me any BAS they just gonna tell me the truth and people respect that believe it or not if you don't get out you don't work with them anyway  that okay  she answered you like better understanding mobile  hi there UCLA coming in strong go ahead else have a question were  yo could you  extend your sort of principles and philosophy on running a business and defending yourself she just told you a pink berry who has been very sound a lot like you know bubbling fun energetic  no she's that's her brand right she's in here talk about wine and beer and I'm fine I'm fine I'm about the artist that's who she is so users language berries for a pink berry as a brand is an extension of yo it is this call what throw you yo  yeah we will go  well  thank you  I'm here all night all night two drink minimum okay yeah you know what it's funny if you read all the messaging from  fell concrete concrete brands the sound off a lot like you know we do know they do check it out  you know I actually have an article on the terms like this but maybe I am an articling ten understand your own personal brand  what should you do you should ask people what do you think of me yeah  where it's not about you it's what they think so we're gonna say things about Chris what do they say about me glad when they say let me go  I mean I'm not fine  sardonic sardonic they say things like that so what you do is you kind of write those words down he started thinking this is what people know me as do I like that  I don't I need to start to change things were all cable will change and the changes and to please somebody else's because I looked in the mirror and I don't like that I know exactly what my brain is okay sometimes I'm a jerk that's totally true sometimes I'm can be charming some a check that's how I do it nationals two things and I might send you a biting comment but with a little smile and maybe maybe just a jerk that's fine all right there's a question in the back there  if you use your a I guess graphic design process like design center speaking for all of your business so  all your business is like a designer first  as CEO is there a different  that's a really good question I think the first specially for the first  the first one there could be company I did think of it as like what to the brand look like instead of how much is the product going to sell for and who is the market will open it here  what it what is it like China  train employees so I didn't even think about all that I didn't have a business plan and I just went for it with just the brand and I think that's a really bad thing to do it was a mistake but you learn you know  now I think you should at least come up with a plan like at least the differences with LA downtown  before we even started we actually went to hotels we went to a restaurant and say first of all would you carry this magazine to do you see yourself  putting ads in this magazine so we already we did a mock up we ask questions so we know you're prototyping yeah  yeah invalidating so if you if you guys go into the software world it's like three words right you you  ID eight  validate and iterate  and you go that virtuous cycle over and over and over again into you have gold  and set    just a challenge the notion  now that yo's brands are not yellow let's talk about fruit a little bit I love what you do I really do but the more I see the way you brand the more I feel like it's just you talking to me which is great I love it I love it she has a great high energy brand something that most bands inspired to become fun approachable  not too serious that's great right  so for fruit  I I'm not I'm not gonna get this line right because I'm not a writer but it's something like this where you say good cookies get milk great cookies desertion paying something like that something like that doesn't that sound like yo come for me because I don't drink but that's what I mean it's like it is a reflection of these are good with milk others dimension pain demands men the men were those of people  writers who read that though yeah  and the question your prices  and for my client is boosting the bottom line see right guys thank you very much for tuning in and I would like to give a round of applause to yell  really appreciate  thank  \",\n",

       " \"welcome everyone we're going to talk today about not listening to users about sampling their experience  three years ago I worked I started working in a Google search  before that I worked in in ads for two and a half years and we started getting more and more interested in what people want to know  because what you saw on the video  is what people actually do on Google because it's a parody but this is what people actually do we want to know what they want to know with or without connection to Google so a team came to me and we started planning this and since then we've been doing a study that we call internally then that stands for daily information needs  and this has been going on since then in the US and in other countries around the world  with we pretty much ask our study participants is this question what did you want to know recently and we asked this question over and over again during a few days and we ask a lot of people we asked this question  we even have  tee shirts for that then project  internally at Google hi my name is Donna Sheron I'm a Google search user experience researcher and today we're going to talk about the method called experience sampling  the problem I want to start and talk a few minutes about the problem that we have  the problem is that people listen to users  what I call is to not listen to people  opinions or ask them any questions about the future would you use something instead I call for observing behavior  and I want to talk a little bit about why I don't listen to users because of what I know about the psychology of the difference or the relationship between attitude and behavior  attitude is what people say they do and behavior is what they actually do  here's one study this was done in nineteen thirty seven the researcher went into classrooms and ask students  would you cheat in an example  and they answered a few weeks after that got back to the same students and together with the teachers they were giving the students an opportunity to cheat without them knowing that that you know the they're being tracked  and surprise surprise  there was close to zero correlation between what people said that about their future behavior and their actual behavior  this was nineteen thirty seven at seventy seven years ago  something from twenty twelve researchers in the UK and this was done with dozens of thousands of people in the U. K.  went into a public bathrooms in gas stations all over the country  when they ask people coming out of the bathroom did you wash your hands after you finished your your business and ninety nine percent of people said yes  however  they also installed electronic recording devices inside the bathrooms and they actually counted how many people wash their hands  and again thirty two percent of men and sixty four percent of women really did wash their hands now there many reasons why this is happening  lying is not one of them  okay usually people are not intentionally lying about their behavior  with just a very bad at predicting it  now I wanna take you into the start up world I've been interviewing a lot of people  in the start up world in the arm what I found is this  this is the main the main finding  entrepreneurs have no time or budget to spend on learning from users  this is what I what I observed and I interviewed a hundred fifty start up founders and feces because I was so surprised by what I hear what I heard from from start ups in I also talked with the season I was even more depressed but  I want to share the other primary findings from this  from these interviews only twelve percent of them  new what is user experience  and I was very generous I ask them a direct question in your opinion what is the definition of user experience and they gave me their answer  I was very generous in invalidating their responses and even after this generosity only twelve percent of them really knew the find it very well  another finding a start up idea is born from the founders personal pain eighty six percent of start up founders start their start up because they had a problem  okay now it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just a finding it could be bad if they're convinced that the entire world has this problem in many cases they are convinced that this is so  I also asked  what are other reasons that you started your your start ups this is what I found the personal pain eighty six percent and use the research is down there with with two percent meaning that they did research to identify user needs and then they came up with an idea based on what they found  in between spin off they started a company and then pivoted or change it completely  started a new company  based on what they did  our requests from clients clients came to them and ask them for something and they started a company or they read a market research reports but the main result here is that it's solely based on personal pain  what I saw is that ideas are mostly for products or services  there was close to zero  percent of of the people I interviewed  who fought about a problem  the problem to solve and started with this  here's  opening that they think about the problem before they started and you can clearly see that who knows what this is except for that it's a phone yep  it's a jitterbug phone yeah what's special about the jitterbug phone  it's for all the people who have a hard time reading  I agree it's even more than than just hard time reading  they have big buttons here  it's not the size of the phone but it's not far from it it's really really big  are the letters are the font is really big there's this cover here  all of this can you think why why they're doing this  why are all these a special features what is the prior knowledge  a phone for complete novices  but they don't know  they have no neither concept of of of modern smartphones yes  they have real physical needs for different with four different types of interfaces why  I argue that there is for every new product  there's prior knowledge that people apply to using this new product  what is the prior knowledge of elderly people when they use this  that's a problem what is their knowledge  push button land line I would go even further back  this is their prior knowledge  now let's compare these big fonts  and then there's the thing how many of you saw  elderly people use a smart phone like this  you saw that  that's for a reason that's the reason  because it worked its way to reach their their mouth and here and this is what they did here this cover here this this a great cover here is to block the noise exactly as you could have done with this and there are other other features that are just easier for people to use it's not based on prior knowledge but it's based on what is that they don't have  everything here is is a yes no questions  they type they dial the phone number and then it asked them call and there are two yes no of buttons so it's all very kind of conversation also they don't need to understand if you remember the buttons back then send the end or figure out different different icons icons and what they mean  so this is based on fundamentally understanding a problem  these are the questions app developers and start up founders ask themselves these are great questions that they ask themselves ninety seven percent ask what my customers ninety five percent pass a critical question do people need my product  an eighty nine percent ask if the product is usable or not  and other questions  bass and drive and the passengers can actually stay warm  so she picked out her sketchbook right then and there and begin drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper  no it's a product designer I try to learn from people like merry  try to see the world the way it really is  not the way we think it is  why because it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees  but it's hard to solve the problem that almost no one sees  now some people think you're born with disability or you're not  as if Mary Anderson was hard wired at birth to see the world more clearly  that wasn't the case for me I had to work at  during my years at apple  the job challenge this  to come in to work every day  to see  but this is the problem  the way people answer their quick great questions is extremely invalid and unreliable and I want to share some of these  answers and some of them are funny but they're they well represent the answers I got in a hundred and fifty interviews  who are my customers the way they answer it is analytics an assumption personas they invented personas inventive personas are personas that are based on nothing  based on intuition not on research  analytics they they go through demographics  and this is how they know who their customers are  do people need my product again a critical question and there are ways to answer it with research this is how they answer it and I'm not getting  is the product usable  we focus on you ex you really really really really focus on you X. meaning that it's good  we use it ourselves is another answer we know if it's usable or not  we the founders we the company is our product better than the competition  after a ten minute argument that they have no competition and we think that they do have competition without even knowing them they agree and answer a we do things differently can't compare  and if if we can't compare we compare feature lists we look at the competitions website and we see a long  list of features we compared to ours and then we know who's better  is a product getting better  we prove it all the time so yes  and the people want the product which is by the way a question I'm not really suggesting you ask because what people want doesn't really matter what matters is what they need and it's always different  and the yeah I I kid here but this is what they do they ask friends and family members and friends and family members are very nice to you they want you to succeed but they're really biased so that's a problem  all of this means one thing that's a huge risk that they're taking  huge risk  he's not going to catch it right  and these start ups develop products that nobody nobody needs  and they're executing the wrong plan  you you came here I know you never did that right  but just in case you do  I want to introduce you to experience sampling  experience sampling is what's called the strategic research technique at its strategic because it's looking at I'm covering user needs it's not evaluating a product or design that we currently have  so in the tent project  what we did is this we asked people the same question over and over again what did you want to know recently  and we saw this I'm I'm I can't share the data but   tenet and and the size doesn't really represent the data but  we have two parts of of answers one part is what people search on Google that they shared with us  and there's another part of what people want to know that Google can't give them today  and these are two examples what they do on Google is things like not just of course but barackobama heights and  was very good with thousands of types of of of questions or queries such as that  but they also want to know for example what type of writer and my  Google can give this to them today  so all of this what people want to know that they can't do today is an opportunity for us  and this is extremely indicative of user needs  experience sampling is a research technique where you interrupt people's daily lives and asked them to notice note their experience about something in our case this was what did you want to know recently  it's very good for identifying needs for understanding what features people needs okay not comparing feature lists to competition  and foreign covering current pain points and the lights  here's here are the ingredients this is what  what you need to do to run an experience  I'm playing study and it's not really hard  first you need to very carefully think about the question that you're asking it's really really important again in our example we asked what did you want to know recently we also ask this was the lead question we also ask some more questions for example why because some  answers we learned are are not really telling us a lot and I'm going to give a few examples later  we also asked people for example  if a picture better explains your answer take a picture and send it to us  and so on and so forth we asked a few other questions were you with other people or who needed the information and so on and so forth  generally speaking we planned each notification to take about one minute to answer not about up to one minute to answer because otherwise people feel overwhelmed we asked the question on a five eight times a day  if it's a burden that they will participate  now there's a question how many times do I ask them it depends on how many answers you want so and it depends on the on the activity that you're looking after  it that you're looking at so for example if it's what did you want to know recently  I claim that people want to know hundreds maybe thousands of things during a typical day we only ask the question five or eight times  but if it's what was the reason you recently updated your website  that might not happen several times a day so you need to kind of do some reverse mathematics and start with how many answers you want by the end of the study that say you want to thousand five hundred answers and  and then you can start dividing that say you have a hundred participants and then you decide that okay I'm going to send it to them five times a day for five days then you get to two thousand five hundred because some of them will be garbage and and and things you don't understand but  this is how you calculated  carefully choose a medium  text messaging email and apps of phone message you can call them  and ask them to or ask them to call you and leave a message  it these are all valid  ways the  primary thing you need to to think about in advance is how are you going to collect the data because if it's a text message that you then need to copy and paste into a spreadsheet that's not gonna work with two hundred two thousand responses so think of a way a good way to do that   ask them to fill a form with one question or something like that and then it goes into a spreadsheet or if you are more capable  you can use  if if you heard about it and and things like that but think about it in advance don't find yourself a copying and pasting two thousand responses  we used Paco Paco is an app   an android app for sure  not sure if there's an iOS version yet I know they're working on it or worked on it   publicly but available posco stands for personal analytics companion and also the name of the dog of the developer and  it's an app that allows us to send the two figurations and and manage this whole experience happened process really easy  decide how to collect the data in a spreadsheet  or something like that  now  participants I mentioned a hundred dissidents or or participants in general you need to carefully think about participants and what you gonna do with them how many we talked about that expectations they need to know what you expect of them  you need to brief them not too much you don't want to give them examples of answers because this way you're only going to get these examples stay vague with with regards to what you want them to share or how you want them to answer but do you explain that you expect them to answer each time and to answer all the questions that that you ask and answer the question in a way that would make you understand what they mean  practice  a couple days before the study send the question once  and and see what you get and if they are participants who are not really giving you what you want to work with them on that  give them an incentive an incentive at Google we pay him but   and we have money to pay and I know a lot of small companies don't have the money to pay to them I say  and so incentive is not  this is the early money  if you're a startup a small start up if you have an office create a wall of fame of people who helped us with research put their names on it take a picture and send it to them people love their name  that would be a great incentive if you don't have an office have a a web page for that the wall of fame of of study participants who helped us on your site  the moment you're thinking about research in general and experience sampling specifically because if it involves a lot of participants start recruiting them find them start finding them  there are ways to do that I'm not going to describe that now because it's a it's gonna take me awhile but start recruiting your participants as soon as possible recording finding people to participate in research is the biggest bottleneck of research  let's talk about the analysis we talked about how we collect the data who we do with with and what you do with them let's talk a little bit about the analysis so we need to decide  on categories that you're going to classify the data so imagine you're getting two thousand responses now you need to do something with them what you do is classified them into different categories  we had in in the daily information needs study we had forty plus categories before we even started with the fines and with with with real specifics the specifics what are the categories and one of the options in each category  let's say let's take an example so let's say they  this is our experience sampling question what frustrated you the last time you went grocery shopping  so here are some categories  the location to be one category where the frustration took place and options might be  the ones you see here home way too from storing car parking lot and at the store another category would be a close people friends and family who might be involved spouse roommate kids  another one with the people at the store so you look at each response any classified by these categories I'm gonna show you how you did that in a second so people at the store could be other customers can shear store service personnel and so on and so forth and what was the issue finding items understand it costs and long lines this is just an example  so what you do with it  you classify each and every response let's say this is one of the responses  I asked the question what frustrated you in in your recent grocery shopping experience and this is one answer a slow kiss year combined with an elderly pass person who was in front of me on the line calls me to be late to pick up my son from school all right so how do you classify that so the location is at the store close people are kids people at the store other customers and the cashier and the issue was long lines  so you kind of disassemble each and every response into its components  and  as you do that you learn that your pre defined categories are not so good sometimes you need to merge them sometimes you need to split them sometimes you need to create a new one sometime you need to  get rid of a few that's fine do that  clean the data as you go  dogs is an answer we got to the question  what did you want to know recently  we have no idea what dogs mean  so  so you need to clean this data this is an answer to the the frustration at the grocery store  question  has nothing to do with what you need so clean that they  and generate what's  she needs help yes  yes  and then you can generate frequency charts based on your classification you kind of re assembling the data in a meaningful way so you know what happened most so maybe if long lines is the main problem maybe you need to do something about it  and you'll see that you'll very quickly identify themes and what you need to do another way of doing that is what's called eyeballing the data just reading the responses gives you a lot of information understanding about what happened there  this is an example of these are our responses to this question what was the reason you recently used a piece of paper to write something down and this is how you very quickly I ball the data into groups some people are making lists some people writing ideas some people are sketching stuff  if you want to read more about this you know almost nothing about the experience sampling at this point  if you want to read more about it  this is a a a a book I recommend   the last guy there is a ten speaker he speaks about other things  at Ted he speaks about flow  but this is a really good book to understand  experience sampling one second  so experience sampling is what's called reality mining you mind the reality of your users  it helps you fall in love with the problem which is critical to solving a real problem that people care about  and I know this is the distribute   sandbox so let's make at least one connection here  if you solve a real problem people care about I think it's very it's very helpful in terms of distribution  so last thought  I don't just believe everything I say because I stand here tried out on your own it's almost as easy as it sounds  thank you  \",\n",
       " \"hi I'm outside a cafe at the Google office in Mountain View California and we're about to see how guerrilla usability testing with as few as five users can help you find up to eighty five percent of the core usability problems in your app come on let's go take a look  thank you for stopping by I'm working with a client on a mobile application and a minute I'll show you the application and I'll ask you some questions about it it'll take about ten minutes as you go through the application I want you to think aloud to voice whatever you're thinking or feeling as you look through it please be honest this is a test of the application not if you are  time out  usability testing as a lot of fun and it's one of the most effective tools you have to improve the quality of your app or website in fact it doesn't matter if it's an app a website a remote control or door usability simply means that people can use the thing for its intended purpose and here's one fun and simple way to conduct a really usability testing go to a fairly popular cafe ask people to tester out for ten minutes and then give them a small treat as a thanks it's a great way to spend an hour okay time in  the great news is that you only need to talk to five users to find eighty five percent of the core usability problems your most important usability problems are easy to spot for people who are new to your application and difficult for you to spot because you no longer have fresh eyes you're too close to the product to know how real people perceive it for the first time  good news  sin is a usability testing pioneer who led extensive research to arrive at the magic five users number it turns out that you learn a lot from the first person you talk to a little less from the next and so forth after the fifty user you're wasting your time by observing the same findings repeatedly but not learning much new  you can use our ready made template to customize your survey and print out a sign for the cafe next decide who will go one or two people is the perfect number you don't want to have more than three people because it may make your tester feel uncomfortable everyone involved in your product should go at some point this includes your designer developer product manager executive customer service people etcetera you want to choose a nice reward to gift your testers like a gift card to the cafe or buy them a drink or dessert  people for a loan are easy to ask and remember after five people you're done  the think aloud method is critical for getting inside the user's head it means asking the user to speak out loud everything they are thinking for example they should be saying things like this looks like a news app I wonder how I can get it to show me the sports news maybe if I tap here that's where I think it might let me select the category  that loaded pretty slowly etcetera  be sure to take good notes of what people say some clear patterns will emerge from the feedback you get back home you can fix these usability problems and what's critical is that you then come back to the cafe to validate that users no longer face these issues are I well I think we're done so now that we're finished you have any questions for me  it was  interesting I hope the feedback is helpful thank you so much  and now it's your turn you now have a new tool in your belt to make your app even more awesome go on  try this out in the real world you can customize our template and questionnaire to suit your app I'm forced missus with the Google developer relations team thanks for watching  \",\n",
       " \"hi my name is Brian would I'm a web developer and I create a lot of different kinds of learning content for people to be able to learn that type of stuff and actually of Travis Nielsen here who is from Google and you know me a little bit about that  I work at Google and search and then a  work hard to teach people what I'm learning lately through videos like this or podcasts or speaking nights so we we have a lot of things that we go through as a you ex designer  creating our our process or content or thing creating personas gathering research but they're definitely our best practices that we could follow absolutely so do you have any best practices let's say for research and do some of the best number one leg do some research and and it's funny because this can be something that  could be tempting to gloss over any because you're not producing the slick thing that you can show your investor or your client your like your understanding things you're learning and hand how do you how do you work that into a budget  it's a line item learning but it but the truth is like do some research do it figured out right seems like it'd be easy to gloss over  another thing you can do is test risky ideas and crazy ideas as early as possible  and this is that's interesting because that it does that mean that we're trying to like save time later now to save your time save money says it's just risk you know like we want to mitigate that risk by trying things early okay  and another one is just to to when you're doing your research to make sure you're not leaned so heavily on on quantity  hated data or qualitative data that you have a balance between the two describe this to him yeah it's a qualitative data is like I found out that people don't like this or they feel this way about and that's the quality another quantitative data is that when I change this thing the blue nobody tapped on it that's the that's the quantitative as the quantity thing right here to balance those two things what do you get business wise and how people feel about it  and then the last thing you know the best way to do research the best practices is to partner collaborate with a researcher can be better than you for sure  what I do like the fact that you say if possible because there are some was out there that might be freelancers and we're kind of a one stop shop and that yeah yeah so we do we can yep products come in all shapes and sizes if you need to do your own research if possible partner so let's talk a little bit about best practices for some of the tools that we might actually use   I think you know  really understanding that all you ex tools are communication tools is gonna take you a long a long way and that that way you can start to it to balance for proficiency and perfection it's not about being the best designer it's about using the right tool to get the job done as quickly as possible might some of the tools we were talking about yeah in a flexible designer every day will be better than than the person who gets it perfect but it takes them forever and then what about being faster provision or speed I got the other one of the that's that's one of the things that I always look for in a tool is is how fast can help me to get the thing done  all take a paper napkin sketch over initial prototype any day as long as it gets the thing done  there was talk a little about best practices for being able to test the prototype bird whatever's that we happen to have  sometimes it's kind of counter intuitive but we wanted we won it test in order to disprove our ideas  because we want to save time and money we're not trying to spend it on like wild crazy thing so test those early and often like we talked about in and and I deleted disprove your ideas you can we move on to the next thing that does work because we're we're we're prototyping we're not usually the code yet right can yeah of time and effort energy yeah right like low low low process or get that high answer early on other things is to look look for the unexplained and and and surprising things the during research in prototyping and stuff something will happen and then the best the the best  follow one is not to say like  this didn't happen but is say why didn't this happen so so try to explain try to be involved in that testing and and then finally you go for that the low hanging fruit what's meant by that is like the easy tweaks that you can make to make the what largest improvements in the experience that's called the low hanging fruit just pull it off the branch you need and it makes sense yeah so having best practices for the research for the you know the tools that we use and for the user testing is is pretty phenomenal something else when I think about the the idea of best practices it really comes out through practice so so we can talk about this stuff all all day long and and make these really helpful videos but getting your hands dirty and and practicing will teach you these things through experience it will become second nature  makes sense  \",\n",
       " \"my name is Tom Roberts the VP of interactive and design at  I'm responsible for product management design you X. research product analytics for all the digital products we do with another group here that's responsible for the physical hardware but we do all the digital side  in terms of the product management design work what's the most important thing I need to know to step into your role here a lot of my job these days is about building teams  great software is a with a social art  your job is essentially I can too creating rock bands that you need to construct and pull together the right musicians the right people to be able to play in a band together well Sir certainly have been products that have been made by individuals but that where there are rock stars who make an incredible product  I don't think that's the methodology we have here how you foster create those teams as units how you stay in touch with them so you understand if something's going awry if one of the members doesn't mesh with the other members at the end of the day if you can step back and say well we've got   rock band and a country western band and a death metal band to waive the flavors of bands are that you need they can make amazing music that's what this world what is an average day like for you here at work at  we have numerous teams all working in parallel and I tried spends much of my time as possible being gauge of those teams understanding that road blocks that they're hitting the challenges that they're running into and trying to connect the dots between those teams so that the work that they're doing really fits nicely together the  then the other piece of it is  the recruiting piece of my job which is you know we're trying to build more more of those teams out so  talking to lots of people on a daily basis who are potential product managers potential designers who are interested in what we're doing and figure out if they could be a member of one of those teams  what is your job role when you joined what was your job like that and how has it changed over the past few years when I joined the company we were a little bit less than ten people  so we're a little bit north of two hundred twenty people now so  pretty different feel of company back that  my role was essentially the same role that I have now  it was just that I did a lot more of the work myself I was actually doing interface design I was actually doing product requirements I was figuring out stuff at a much more hands on way wears locally these days we have  much more talented people to do the actual work better you know me actually doing interface design  if you were a kid growing up what was the thing that you wanted to be I want to be an artist when I grow up and how did you get from being an artist to being in the tech industry Sir  I went to college and  ended up getting a liberal arts degree I got a bachelor's in  in psych from Vassar College and is really at the end of my education that I came to the realization that I really did want to academia I didn't want to do psychology I wanted to make stuff one design build and make stuff since then I had to figure out how do you go from a degree in psychology to building in making and designing stuff attempted to explore the field of industrial design but you actually have real credentials as a designer to get into that which I didn't have and so I found that I could actually transition my experience in doing psychology to working in the software world and that became a segue to doing product management and actually making products of software and everything else I just learn by doing and another job there was one specific class I think was really instrumental for me which was in cognitive science really mixed everything from computer science to  neurobiology to psychology to anthropology ultimately  management making software is also very multi disciplinary it's really understanding how engineering help design and how the business all get mixed together and so I think with that combination of things that made me feel very passionate excited about being able to apply that multi disciplinary approach to making something they'll do you have something that you do that is a creative outlet with young kids fit bitten trying to actually stay healthy  and just spend time with the family doesn't leave a lot outside of that  that said my latest practice which has been awesome is my eldest son has become really interested in drawing monsters so every night  before I go to bed I draw him a new monster and I leave that out on the kitchen table and so when he gets up at five fifteen in the morning he gets excited he goes downstairs he finds the monster he colors the monster in which also has the double effect of actually let me sleep in for another fifteen to twenty minutes  but also means that I get to draw the monster every night from like as you see more and more people walking around with these that that's on and talking about their status as I feel for you you know when I started fit bed it is still very much of an early adopter kind of geeky product and to see it go from being this early adopter  product when it was launched to tech crunch to help being in every single best by  being in the Korean over twenty thousand retail store fronts  nationwide in the US alone  the and and and many many countries around the world  it's pretty amazing it happened super fast  and you know when I get on bart and I see someone wearing a fit that when I go to the gym and see people wearing fits  it's amazing societally we've used engineering and technology to engineer activity out of our lives for many many decades whether it's  remote controls or software games or elevators or escalators or cars or whatever that technology is so much of it actually the consequence of it is it makes you sit around a lot more move less and so to use technology to kind of fight back the other direction to interject more activity into people's lives is is an amazing mission and when you think about what's the challenges that we're facing societally  it has to do with the fact that we spend most of our day sitting in front of a computer which is not what we were biologically designed to do city use technology to bring awareness and engagement to begin activity is a fantastic job at  \",\n",
       " \"   so I'm not a mac or three and I'm director of hardware engineering here at Facebook  I leave the group that that builds  and develops that hardware is the servers storage and the racks are the Facebook users to run a website  can you tell me about the process of prototyping and a new server usually starts out a white board  like so many things to  and then often times they run down here and start building hack where the mechanical lab right now which is  which is a fun spot because that's where a lot of our early innovation takes place this is a lot like your high school shop  we have the sheet metal benders and a band size and the table saw and all the fun dangerous toys  that we normally get to high school students but in in this case  we let our engineers play with and this is where we play with early idea you know we do a lot of early work and just bending sheet metal cutting balsa wood or plywood gluing things together because a lot of it is really understanding how the new design might functional scale how humans interact with that and how the technology lays into a new enclosure or a new form factor  there are so many people in our industry who designed servers get have never seen a production data center they've never been out to one they really don't know what the real experiences and what the opportunities are you need to know very well the people who use your products into the experience you're creating  it is insufficient to just write it write a paper about it or or to have somebody else write a paper and you read it you really need to to walk a mile in their shoes  you know some people follow that straight and narrow path with an engineering degree and  right into an engineering job and I I was not one of those people it started when  I was actually even in middle school  a friend of mine's dad was a real tanker this is early days of like IBM PC's in the eighties and I go over my friend's house and we try to fix and that led to my first job which was computer repair to my high school job was working at the local PC repair shop you know fixing old IBM PC's and two eighty sixes and it has some really old  clicking here but that's how I really built a passion for computer hardware when I was looking at at college I'd met   with a friend of my dad's over Microsoft and his advice was actually to not get a computer science degree he said you know we we see tens of thousands of four point GPA computer science grads every year and lightly that's a very hard way to get into Microsoft and he said go take a year computer science learn the basics teach yourself the rest and go learn something you can apply go learn some other skill that works with computers that adds a lot more depth of what you do and so my passion about photography for a long time  and try to win after photography degree and you know took a background in computer science and math while I was in college  but then I dropped out  he didn't finish I didn't finish known now and as a as a matter of fact I I have one quarter left of my degree  let imagine at your level doing server engineering for face but there aren't very many people that you can get advice from our our industry for a long time was so silent data center operators just didn't talk the great part about OCPD open compute project we build is we've for the first time created a community where data center operators and industry leaders can come together because at the end of the day no one wants to do the clicking of work we wanted to the innovative work if we spend all our time reinventing the wheel Microsoft reinventing the wheel because no one sharing their wheel design we all go slower if we can share the wheel design if we can get off the ground on the basic stuff in the innovation just speeds up  I'm gonna take over your job tomorrow and I'm just starting from scratch what the most important thing I need to know how do I prepare  I see myself as more of a service ran to the people on my team  in fact I a  I draw our charts upside down it's a silly detail but I put myself in the bottom half of the engineers on the top because the way I see my world is I'm here to support them the engineers the one to actually build things and so for my job it's a supporting role playing that's the first thing and the second is really get to know the context of your work get to know you know the data center environment yourself get out there I will cause the technician not just my engineers but I'm actually out in the data center  fixing service myself I do it multiple times per year  and so I think it's really important as the leader of the team to know why we're doing what we're doing but problems were solving and broadly sort of  what the overall mission of Facebook and the Facebook infrastructure demands  any one of these servers you know any little thing could go wrong with that you find yourself are you a perfectionist you have to be a perfectionist you really don't actually in in fact  you know perfection is the enemy of execution  if you're a perfectionist you never build anything and so we're hackers we move really fast we build creative things but we also understand that there will always be concerns in the field you always learn more I would tell tell my team to reserve the right to be smarter tomorrow than you are today and and part of that is you know if if it's looking good let's get some out in the field  because in a way we have the world's largest test lab if you think of us as a hardware company nobody has a bigger test lab  they we do in terms of of a data center environment where we can try things  yeah so some reason is issue what is the way that you kind of unwind and thought you know it's it's silly I'm I'm honored  and so for me on a winding is is more technology I hack I I script  I code a little bit badly automating my house drive my wife crazy just learning how to sort of program  little connected devices at home you know little things like that that I love working on it and so when I go home it's well you know it's more technology and a lot of ways it's it's playing with the the fun little  little fiddly bits  \"]"
