Hey ready welcome to the process %HESITATION Chris on a very special late night edition we are talking to you %HESITATION Santos a woman with many titles the founder and creative director of several companies for at least four in county there are concrete commodity fruit and LA downtown Instagram because when we talk about branding how you can learn from it how businesses can improve their customer retention with branding in building personality stick around and tries again I want you guys to listen to me yeah I designed sandwiches my name is so sick I yet and I talk about the business of this is  a lot of stuff my name's crystal and talk about the business of design at the center of this operating system to understand as a %HESITATION just on with the show title is I hate you did you were watching the process  a whole bunch of people I'm sure they have a bunch of questions and so the audience is been instructed to ask questions and there's no holds bar here with the show right ascend the beginning he's people aren't familiar with you yo personal you prefer yo and your full name is  well  your background is in Gotham design you went to art centre just give us a really brief history how did you get there %HESITATION concrete started %HESITATION but I did for my center and then went to work for a branding agency really quick two weeks then like it went to work in motion graphics for five and a half years and then wow happened to be lucky to %HESITATION find out that the owners of pink berry are looking for an agency my friend told me about it I tried it loved it so I %HESITATION pitched an idea that Saturday and then  got the project and then I quit my job and start her company nice now I know I happen to know the story so there's a little bit more detail and I think you to skip over some of it you know when I went to pitch the aid %HESITATION the new business so she took some time off to take vacation personal days would you dedication time so she took some vacation time worked on her deck got the job and then quit and that's a pretty genius way of doing it minimize the risk if you can get it to my to quit anyways but who knows and the rest is history as opposed what is branding how do you define it  and maybe the most important question is why doesn't matter for businesses so take it away from me branding is very personal as a kid I remember my mom was a road shopping for toys and she said there's there's too but I would I want to let go so it is legal this box was tiny and and he's like he's China version and it's huge and it's the same price you can get this one or this one is and not take the small one says I can already knew all what brand it is like I don't know how to explain it but there's just something about it that's like visceral it's just got in stings and I am as I grew older I think teenage I remember I just love window shopping but I just love looking at items on the shelves and like asking myself why do why was I attracted to this woman I've tried to do this month eventually why I I wanted to do branding because everything is just instincts and it's like sometimes when you look at products you look at things it's like something is pulling your brain back and forth in your emotion but you don't know what it is it's all just like invisible dress and it's just so interesting okay do you know what that invisible thread is the forces that work  it's how a brand speaks how a brand %HESITATION looks what it stands for and %HESITATION how honest and transparent they are as a company %HESITATION there's also have to be some aspects of like being good how the product itself to be amazing obviously it can't brand something that's just silly entirely you start with what it is in at the core which is the tone how does it speak the personality %HESITATION the emotions that it's trying to get you to feel there's something that Simon cynic talks about in that we trust  people and companies that believe what we believe  so they're they're speaking tour guide and your gut doesn't actually have words describing you describe as in this thing and that's what they're tapping into the reason why you buy apple over another product or company even though they're more expensive and probably don't even have the best features is because you believe what they believe in or they believe what you believe in so you feel connection and that gets into the whole like tribes that we belong to if I'm a Harley rider of on the Honda guy aren't accurate guy or Mercedes guy it says something about me and the things that we buy say something about us right I imagine as a little girl you know one the off brand legal product because maybe you felt like it was counterfeit and then you would be a counterfeit and you don't want to knock offs right probably why you like brand name fashions certain things of that nature  even though they're similar products because you believe what they believe in yep okay and so can you amazing part of this is I'm really analytical I'm the opposite of you you do two things ins instinct in your gut and  motion in whatever for me have to decode it put into categories and put a wonders are next to it and so I that might work for a really long time and I've been reverse engineering it for quite some time so I wanna learn a little bit more about how you do what you do but before we jump into it maybe you can tell us a little bit about how it at least from my point of view  people use the word brand all the time I need a new brand but what they really mean is I need a new identity or logo  and how even big firms they were branding firm but what they really are they're not daily systems designer  the design the entire identity system color palettes how to roll out on airplanes in trucks and all that kind of stuff but they really don't do any messaging is M. branding  it's part of branding %HESITATION I would say  that's one of the not one step below but it's something it's one of the channel one of facets yeah one of facets of branding okay so would so you say is one of thousands so I want to like a harder line answer like yes or no  which is the companies that design identity systems would you consider them a branding firm  no is watching the story now now okay %HESITATION yes what no  well  I don't know  a lifeline yes our allies is when you guys  many designs amazing beautiful identity systems the some of the biggest in the world is that branding what's your understanding of branding is an arm a part of your body  is an army  with me  now how do I do now  no I don't believe locals are brands that's not branding at all it's a mark that any system %HESITATION Marty Newmar's definition a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product service or an organization it's a feeling it's not a mark it's all of these things but it's not that thing so let's think about that if if I can do a public service for the world the designers please do not confuse a logo as a brand a brand has several voice of personality has touch points right because you're not buying the apple logo you buy everything that the company stands for and how did they do that they did that through things like %HESITATION think different  when they show pictures of Einstein of Katie is the Kitty Hawk or I don't know the of of the Wright brothers the right brothers or Martin Luther king  people who thought different and we see ourselves as artists to go against  mainstream as non conformance that's why we identify with apple and for into they told you royally screwed up I'll be a Die Hard apple fanboy to the day I die it's all my kids let me here without a question then  people that have seen your work where where should they go to see your work %HESITATION ferro concrete dot com or  alright yo Sentosa dot com in there they are there on the branding train they wanna get positioning right how do they approach as if I was his training methods and you even said this at the beginning of the show which was I wasn't trained to do this but somehow you figured it out so give us some tips as designers who want to elevator game from being not just an identity system is  higher but a Brander what do I need to do  %HESITATION  %HESITATION I think you always have to start by understanding  who they're trying to target what's who's a customer %HESITATION and and really understand what do those people like how what are their hobbies are what individually attracted to knowing all those things it's almost like for me with with the way I look at branding is you're just a match maker you're trying to make two things falling off of each other so if you if your check if you're you're creating this person whether it's okay I'm saying this is going to be a girl she's gonna be bubbly optimistic she's gonna talk to you like this is going to wear stuff like this and you know you're gonna track these kinds of people so it's like for me it's as simple as that is like understanding how one person can you go out there you put them close on them you make them look good you say speak like this talk like this and then like talk to them about how they what they believe in and then make sure that they communicate that to the to the customer other person at trying to fall in love with and then if you're if that actually everything goes well then they don't fall in love with each other  together stellar I'll I got as far  so using the branding as matchmaking so you can't change the person the meaning the customer so you can only change the brand yes and you want to make them as attractive to the person and find compatibility so they can fit and so they can have this kind of glorious relationship  that's how you may  people fall in love  but so how do you do that  the new profile people the provider customers but how do you learn about who your customers are and how do you translate that into messaging colors fonts look and feel that kind of thing how do you do that it's usually %HESITATION for it for me it's still everything is still starts with the words and %HESITATION before it goes to anything visual so  I  usually the client would provide this is the demographic they're thirty five to fifty five or women are up and after that it's mostly for me it's looking online and reading what people actually say about the current brand because it gives me a lot of clues %HESITATION  when they say this is why I love this brand this is why I buy this thing it gives me a lot of clues and I'd pick out words from it upwards from it and %HESITATION put everything in an email that's what I love to do and then and then I'll start putting in other thoughts on top of it make so this if he's  I tried to understand how I even work  specific than she is the first time ever  cool  it's not easy Jose summers in the exact same problem actually but it all but it all started for me it's all stars with boards just putting things together and then sometimes certain words are just like %HESITATION it's plain Jane let's go to at thesaurus and say how many different ways can we say this words and then once you find a beautiful work you start thinking these beautiful it conjure up all these different kinds of imagery then you start looking at it so it's almost like a web process where it like a spider web you start with  words and then you come up with better words you come up with more words and you have a whole day to work and the idea is to simplify simplify simplify simplify there's no point in having up five page where documents at all what you want is a paragraph if you get a paragraph right and then it it actually inspires visual images out of that then then %HESITATION I think you've come up with something that's all that %HESITATION so even if it is something that I've not done myself which is you go and read reviews of the brand the product where you're going  %HESITATION family's Facebook on I don't know no no no it's more about how people talk about the Branson not reviews about the product but how people talk about the plan okay so if the client is say like adidas because I like adidas you would just go on Facebook look up the details page and see what is up with see what people are saying go on blogs what people are saying %HESITATION go on %HESITATION Instagram all those things %HESITATION it's I think it's a lot about listening to what people are saying when they think the brand is not listening  you really basically just described Marty new Myers definition of a brand really it's a person's gut feeling about a product or service so you're reading this sentiment through Facebook or Instagram through blog like you said when they're not listening  because it doesn't matter than what the local looks like doesn't matter what the colors look like it's really depends on how people feel so that's one clue there that was great I love that now I'm gonna challenge a little bit it's my job  you said you look for words and you go to the to the source and you you want to look for a beautiful word what is a beautiful word to you  %HESITATION beautiful word  I think something for me it could be something that's ready could be something that's very visual certain words are very visuals like what visual %HESITATION I can't think of right now chocolate I don't know  it's right there  because of his word as well okay yeah I mean this is about something that describe something there's just so many ways you could choose to describe the same right and then it's just finding what's beautiful within those things now are you you're a are you a native English speaker not now so you're looking up English words or when they would honor language you speak in the nation but only like now only to like ten year old grade in the nation so here's the thing I'm not a native English speaker and by looking around the room there's only a handful of people here as far as I can tell that English as a first language one thing personally that I find so fascinating about English is there's so many words to describe a particular meeting in so many new once ways it's hot it's tempted it's boiling it's all these words and choosing that right word that in your work parlance a beautiful word these these are things I talked about my students all the time and understand the difference between paranoia and fear  that's really to have the understanding and then to be able to drive it through an initial concept okay so now we know read the reviews  when the brain isn't listening  find a beautiful word Sundance we need it's visual that super precise and clear because that drives everything and lastly  write a paragraph that has meaning I'm tired of reading brand strategy from companies that you just  nothing is like a light fluffy cloud I can't do anything with it doesn't look like it is and sound like anything but for some reason companies pay a lot of money to do that it makes them feel safe the use buzz words so there's a warning for you right there if your brand statement is fluffy words that are just you know all on wired %HESITATION under the buzzy marketing jargon that's a warning sign  it has to start to sound like maybe some mean something real yeah I'd be like a real person would say exam and has beliefs and that yeah that's great that's awesome I was really helpful anybody have any questions so far how do you handle when %HESITATION a client may not understand %HESITATION their own clients I'm sorry you know their their own customers and  also like when maybe they're probably maybe ten years behind the curve and you're trying to give them a future look and they're really based maybe two thousand twenty fifteen that's that's something we really struggle  great question so let me just restating case that didn't make the audio clip  how do you work with clients who may be behind the curve and don't have an understanding of future customers how do you deal with that because I'm sure our audience comes across that all the time  and this is a charge question so this one might explode on us so as to how yeah and the great Indian answer this so that these  is expressly over hers and hers alone  %HESITATION well it's always good to show and another example hits here here's a company who before the rebrand was this this big this much this many customers and here's what happened after the degree  event even though they they think they didn't need it but suddenly they all of the open up their customer base to this other demographic so it's always I think it's always people always like stories people almost like to hear success stories and if you can give some adults that  it relates to what the concerns are I think that would be helpful what you're saying is you need to have in part of your bag of tricks arsenal of debate case studies  this use in laws use everywhere business case studies so you can talk about it you you want to talk to business person you need to learn their language so what I would say Michael is let's not talk about graphics colors as that X. those kinds of things because things are highly subjective right you can show me something and you could say this is really cool Chris I could know it's not that so two thousand and thirteen and we can have a debate about it let's talk about real things here here's a very clear difference between two companies position in a very similar place target and Kmart  two companies are mass consumer goods one as a brand where you would go to because they have really sometimes quality design work Ford not anymore money now I remember growing up as a kid because we were poor came are like I didn't want to be seen at Kmart but Tarjei on the other hand that's cool right  so you need to cite case studies to help your clients understand in terms that they appreciate and usually the terms I appreciate his bottom line market share revenue new markets innovation so let's learn to talk the language of business has okay  our guide  some then short short I had a client same issue I bought the Harvard Business Review which I love they started leaving it in their magazine rack in the office  and eventually he started actually reading it actually it's described  and now he started telling me what he needed to do I don't even have to tell  what is that called that's like a Trojan horse inception when he needs to there is that inception yeah it is action influence influence he didn't believe me but he believes the Harvard Business Review it's always true guy you're getting paid to to give him you know this advice why did you not believe that's also some we struggle with all my god this is another show called on yeah  the great question though let me the great I think why pay somebody not listen to them I'll tell you why the second you know and there's a thing about credibility  Harvard Business Review you've heard of that school Harvard  who's like a baller  they could say the same thing  right and I had this exact same argument has a and like I say this in the future I talk and he's like no they said this famous person that okay you're right  I said the same thing I told you to you know what I'm talking about we will mention that but he's like yeah you're right just anything like that so a lot of it has credibility so when you say something from you it sounds like it's self serving  you don't have to take my word for it reading the Wall Street journal  reading the New York times  Dr X. Y. Z. from the %HESITATION fortune two hundred nine hundred companies said this it's up to you now man  right so unfortunately as designers we've been trained to much to talk about design graphics and color and  kinds of things  you're losing that argument every single time I tell you that  as if he ever higher creative person and they do work for you they'll tell you your ideas are stupid that your old that you're laying the you don't know what the new hotness is right the hell that occurs passe wouldn't even argue with them yeah you just some dumb punk kid is going to tell me what this that XR but that's what you sound like two other person but let's move on we're here to talk about brain in my head of that okay  so I think we touched on this a little bit but tell me a little bit about your secret sauce how do you get brands personality secret sauce I did not  human personality make them fall in love with each other how that how well I'm I'm a boring commodity I'm a marker sell me this man I'm just kidding %HESITATION how do you give this marker personality  %HESITATION well was it trying to track I don't know  please try to track people like Jose he loves sharpie what would you do how do you get a personality  I don't know you know I don't know  on the internet wants to know how do you do it maybe sure case study it could be something you've done or something you see in Europe Meyer because you're in this space we want to hear from you  I'd say Ellie downtown %HESITATION Canada but yes you can okay let's just say this is a  so I mean I mean downtown for thirteen years this was before downtown was even like safe to live in not just save  %HESITATION but anyway so I've been living in downtown for that long and I've seen the  change that it has happened in downtown apartment there like popping up restaurants businesses shopping malls and and for me what was missing was %HESITATION something that to give that downtown a voice that it's actually a cool place to live in that it has changed from when he was thirteen years ago that it's something you need to celebrate and so missed the point that was a that was the brief that was the brief right that's a that's a brief how do we design something like that first we came up with the name %HESITATION I live downtown %HESITATION we we came up with a few other name I can't remember what it is now but there's something about LA downtown there so simple it's memorable and sense of pride %HESITATION so we we came up we went in that name and then the other thing is the logo we want what other names and to come up with I'm just here I can't remember right now not one not one it was just funny was instincts I've shot  I can't remember I can't remember if it's a man is right style yeah  when I'm really happy with someone's what I kick their care good job shadow  going to be here  giving a brand of personality to the name status with the name %HESITATION starts with  of course knowing what demographic you're trying to track and then putting some words together what is it is it because it help is a culture is it influential is it are you a curator  but the personality trait together and then after that you start thinking about what would this person say what with this brand say and you'll start putting save this it's trying to say  one way OR one sentence and you do it in five six times in different ways like in a more we DO  in a more romantic way on and then suddenly something feels right and something hits does it what fits with the what you try what demographic your China %HESITATION talked to and then after that once you develop a tone of voice you go into visual look and feel what says all those things let me pull it back and it's hard to talk about my process because I have no process  okay we'll probably added that out for your  well okay let let me just pick it up okay  because I'm reverse engineering all process right now okay so you said let's start with the name so how to give brands personality start with the name and you pick LA downtown %HESITATION because it gives you a sense of pride and from the little that I know about writing copy when you write a headline it's supposed to be self selecting meaning the audience either says that's me or not me so you have to plant her flag somewhere inside this is what I stand for it's not for the west side I was gonna start newspaper called the Santa Monica west sider  hello and thanks right yeah so that that means you're either with me or you're not with me and then so that's great so names that don't mean anything like bubble Bob that's not gonna help you start with the name I also like this idea and you probably don't do an informal process but I will be doing it soon he tried to say something and you senator different filters what is the with the version of the romantic their sarcastic the hipster that ironic hipster and you try to see how that sounds now you have an example that I love  for pink berry is that is saying we open from nine to five how did you guys a startling daily he sees the open nine to five goes to what  kind of filter that comes out swirling daily %HESITATION the fun but the act the right yeah did send to the %HESITATION filters and it comes out  swirling daily I love that think about this this is how you start to do brand you guys take every dole boring thing that they do that sounds like a voice run it through the brand filters so in the case of pink berry it's DO which is bubbly find what else without a word energetic and probably find an energetic send it through  right sensei said interesting open exit park here don't do this don't do that centers that filter so now what I want you guys to do an audience everybody is watching on the internet is be more cognizant be more aware that when you're going through a store look at how they talk to you  really well designed hotels are very consistent so check out like what some of my favorite about the I'm not gonna mentioning brands we go check them out you'll see the one to do right take notice you can learn a lot from that  all right okay let's move on approach enough on a spot on that yeah  now we started a lot of companies  like almost too many companies you start with your design company these sorts of lunch other companies and be a be on the board of directors that kind of thing why do you start so many companies what's wrong with you  well I think %HESITATION for one I am the type of person who likes to always likes a challenge and I I find I love living ready one design company is not hard enough it's it's hard enough attack no believe me  but I I'd like different subject matters and I love creating brands and I love putting people great people together and see the brand become something else become its own entity so  yeah I think it's as simple as that and and I think one of the first ones that hit me was seeing how amazing I when I would think that it at one store obviously that three three or four employees when I start with them at the time when we stop working with them they had I think over thirty employees over two hundred stores internationally and it was just so inspiring to see the whole process happened in front of your eyes after a while it was just I was just burned out and I wasn't doing my best at Vera concrete I was in managing food well and so it was that's a huge mistake like not understanding your own limitations as much as you you're passionate about it you're spreading sell to them ready myself too thin you know how well she learned that lesson she started to work companies  this is a good student no but but what I but I I did that differently where there's really good people in all right from the beginning whom I know all I'm not so much involved with it I'm pretty much like  this is where to go and have the discussions and like kind of guy did a little bit but it's I don't really do the day to day stuff it's crazy that brick and mortar in this day and age because you're dealing with overhead stabbed firing hiring H. are you deal with lots of stuff when the future seems to be happening online anyway yes tester idea out there several times in my career I've had the opportunity to %HESITATION to close my practice down and go on the client side they've asked me to come join them what happened  recently %HESITATION and I said no most of the time or I actually know all the time I've said no all the time have you had that same thing happened to yeah %HESITATION I actually went through the same experience where %HESITATION %HESITATION a client asked me said that the company to join them full time become the creative director and offered me shares in the company but at the end of the day I I felt it was %HESITATION  I will I'm the type of person who gets bored working on one Brandon one brand only and so part of the charm for having on my own sense it is to work on different subject matter all the time different brands and also one of the things that I really really can't give up is the freedom the freedom of owning your own business the freedom of the struggle every  thank yeah yeah can to work you work with your favorite people and it's there's a sense of ownership and pride and it's just it's just nothing no one and no amount of money can buy that I think  for me it's strange that you saw it as either or that there was no middle ground and the thing I want to talk about is just the power of negotiation and standing that you as a creative human being create a lot of value to the world and what sickens me now as an entrepreneur who'd been doing this for some time is that we just give it away we never said to think  the value has been created give me equity I have equity in the few companies and I've helped them and I contribute to their growth and and I want to part of that so we get into these discussions about will how many percentage of your company are you what do you think that this is worth twenty willing to give me so you don't have to say it's either this way or that way  right some just on it should have been my %HESITATION business consultant  saleable  that's a big deal Kay I'm I'm relatively affordable  percent  yeah  if you do that with the expected remaining board with them but if you just I know it's beautiful I would define as global work we ask for a percentage plus money  because I get both I want money to cover my expenses and I get equity for the intellectual capital and I'm bringing and then we're done ever in my shares I keep doing other things right and if they want more work great let's talk about a retainer under prefer discounted rate everybody wins  because of the special but it could be the one you like maybe one of the  everything is negotiable you get to determine what works for you or you walk and if you were truly valuable truly and not just because you think your valuable your mom told your valuable then they would offer to you guys in %HESITATION stand okay got it got it you said naming was important to you how did you come up with the name of concrete and what that means to you all ferro concrete was actually a simple story in it I was in school all instructors that come up with the fit make name for a big company and then I came up with ferro concrete because I love concrete and then it also became a metaphor for me for because there are concrete means when you put steel beams and you pour concrete into it so it in it's a technology that enables multiple story buildings and bridges and so it became a metaphor for building brands and describes skyscrapers  thank  he  %HESITATION so really what you're talking about is the the iron rebar inside concrete allows it to be much stronger than it is so your brand your identity I'm sorry is dexter the concrete  the rebar is the stuff that allows it to be awesome and strong yes yeah foundation I have I have I have a philosophy live you've heard this before as it is to make money doing what I love so if it's just do what I love it's not gonna work for me does making money not loving it not gonna work  so my whole thing is like I would love for you to redefine what you love redefined what I love yeah not you specifically not our audience like if you're here in image maker your typographers that's what you love so you make layouts annual craft things in Photoshop that's what you love  what if you were a problem solver for many years we describe ourselves as motion designers  so we're only looking for motion design problems to solve  and then my business coach Kerr said anyone watch episode this link here is that he said well why do you define yourself like that near an image maker does anybody need images %HESITATION everybody needs some kind of a mention you're very good at it so certainly broaden out and so the broader I go now them to me the more valuable I've become and the happier I become but I know I'm like a weird dot in that regard no I'm okay it's very true because if you ask me what is what makes me happy %HESITATION or what is the thing that I love when I first graduated I would say making me signing making that hands on yeah hands ocean proceedings that  and seeing it out there and then if you ask me again fire it it made me happy to start all these businesses and you've probably asked me ten years later what makes me happy is probably I don't know  cool  it's kind of this company does take it the people on the street and then we can wrap this thing up  is it hard being a leader yeah  the question and conclude yeah it's a really good question and sadly I am for me it isn't because I'm I'm not the kind of person who it really depends kind of leader you want to be and that kind was like Hey punch in a field folks shoulder and then there's another show there  but but I think my job is to really like inspired the team get them excited to be at work and get them I said about the project work well with each other and  foster discussions and just be kind of a guide not the type of the %HESITATION you're late with  it just depends but for me it it's pretty natural because I think maybe it's because I'm the oldest get to I don't know but it's just comes naturally  I see yeah but I'm I'm I'm already bossy at home anyway  %HESITATION buzzing home nobody  what is it called the match dot com profile at the bottom here  if reloading brands of connecting people I want to connect yeah she's nice she's always making things and we are ready hindering me from going out tonight member there's a party tonight  the firm is made great lovers about this question knows you pursue any further education after  I think you %HESITATION try to go into business or to try to learn how to manage although he sees that a graphic design I don't know how to run a business what you know about marketing or negotiations apparently not a lot not a lot and all that kind of stuff how do you know how to manage people how do you know how to become a leader those are not necessarily skills that the teacher in graphic design for them right now but it's those things that you couldn't pick up as you go and learn and actually it's not just the outcome is about the journey an experience that makes it fun and I learned a lot and meet people cry I've cried you know maybe it was a bad bus one day I don't know probably the alcoholics kidding I'm kidding  they always give me this is your reputation online  have fun  anyway well Hey so I I would like to jump in there we don't as graphic designers or creative people learn any the business skills and I think that puts us at a major deficit there's this thing in three hundred like okay I'm gonna help myself in terms of the total dork is fine Frank Miller three hundred  the night is young boys a spark  and and the tasks of becoming a man  don't be off in the woods with a spear and you have to survive there  it teaches you a lot only the strong make it back  so that's what she's saying like you're on the street you're learning from real people in real circumstances  and there are real consequences when you ask Bob somebody quits you get fired you lose money you go upside down you go bankrupt you lose at all where school you get in D. who cares  nobody cares and that's why it's like this is real now and it's hard it's a dog eat dog world  all right next question you have any tips or advice for leading a meeting with the client leaving a meeting with a client yanks that's a question for you I believe it's addressed to you but it's so how do you do it how do you do it's probably fun to be in meetings with him  it is well  tips I always walking here be always walking happy don't even if you're in a bad mood but anyway it's it's I think a lot of the times you walk into a meeting clients first of all they want it probably senior work online so you might want to show them something in it in the meeting if you want to go into something more details but it's mark mark about you getting to know them and how how much %HESITATION  you you work together and you can you work together as a team you get what they're saying so a lot do a lot of listening %HESITATION and then %HESITATION guidance thing and and talking with re read it read it read to rate I'll reiterate community  but yeah it's it's just about chemistry chemistry and then making sure that %HESITATION you sell they work well in her answers a prize yet all was all about brands about personalities and history her answer will be it's all about your brand in your personality it is I have an answer though yeah you gave me just enough time to think about that yeah okay just  we do meetings all the time  and I used to be scared to death but during the conference call the fate of your company yourself your self worth everything hangs on the freaking conference call give the phone my boys %HESITATION shaking like what I'm gonna do it's because in my mind there was this narrative as creating that was killing me that I need this job I'm not worthy there my masters and they get to anoint  %HESITATION is good and who is not good so every word I'm saying and thinking about four times before I say it and then I secure can say the words shoulder you know you know you say well here's the thing here's what I want to think about  you need to go to meetings  with extreme self belief confidence is what they call that right and confidence is not like I'm the best name drop this I've done this who are you that's what I'm talking about to me confidence is about being vulnerable and being transparent about who you are I find this to happen to me and everyone so I can check myself I go in the room and take %HESITATION you know like if they only found out that I drove a Toyota I'll be ruined so the whole time I'm running around thinking please %HESITATION anybody asked me about Toyota as a preparing lies about Honda's whatever it is I cradle narrative in my mind if I just walked in the room hand but I drive a Toyota it's on the open and I don't give an F. if you think that's cool or not I just don't care  so go into it being transparent say whatever it is you got a big hit but that was it just like I have is it and that's it and nobody can talk about it more  yeah I got a **** leg I got a bad knee I got a you know whatever just own it and be who you are  that's what's going to give you the confidence okay so in your mind he like flipped the  you don't need them  we need each other it was at the table I can do this for you %HESITATION I can't and now we go to the next person and good luck with whoever you pick  so when you go into a room and I like to go in completely unprepared I don't know anything about them I don't do any research because I find that then I don't jump to any conclusions I I don't need to be the smartest guy in the room and I tell them a lot up front and only thing about you I just wanna learn some ask you a few questions and I'm gonna shut up and listen and I'll take notes and I'll ask you questions  that's really refreshing for people you know so now I'm endearing myself and I'm like wow this person isn't gonna give me any BAS they just gonna tell me the truth and people respect that believe it or not if you don't get out you don't work with them anyway  that okay  she answered you like better understanding mobile  hi there UCLA coming in strong go ahead else have a question were %HESITATION yo could you %HESITATION extend your sort of principles and philosophy on running a business and defending yourself she just told you a pink berry who has been very sound a lot like you know bubbling fun energetic %HESITATION no she's that's her brand right she's in here talk about wine and beer and I'm fine I'm fine I'm about the artist that's who she is so users language berries for a pink berry as a brand is an extension of yo it is this call what throw you yo  yeah we will go  well  thank you  I'm here all night all night two drink minimum okay yeah you know what it's funny if you read all the messaging from  fell concrete concrete brands the sound off a lot like you know we do know they do check it out  you know I actually have an article on the terms like this but maybe I am an articling ten understand your own personal brand  what should you do you should ask people what do you think of me yeah  where it's not about you it's what they think so we're gonna say things about Chris what do they say about me glad when they say let me go  I mean I'm not fine  sardonic sardonic they say things like that so what you do is you kind of write those words down he started thinking this is what people know me as do I like that  I don't I need to start to change things were all cable will change and the changes and to please somebody else's because I looked in the mirror and I don't like that I know exactly what my brain is okay sometimes I'm a jerk that's totally true sometimes I'm can be charming some a check that's how I do it nationals two things and I might send you a biting comment but with a little smile and maybe maybe just a jerk that's fine all right there's a question in the back there  if you use your a I guess graphic design process like design center speaking for all of your business so  all your business is like a designer first  as CEO is there a different %HESITATION that's a really good question I think the first specially for the first  the first one there could be company I did think of it as like what to the brand look like instead of how much is the product going to sell for and who is the market will open it here %HESITATION what it what is it like China %HESITATION train employees so I didn't even think about all that I didn't have a business plan and I just went for it with just the brand and I think that's a really bad thing to do it was a mistake but you learn you know %HESITATION now I think you should at least come up with a plan like at least the differences with LA downtown %HESITATION before we even started we actually went to hotels we went to a restaurant and say first of all would you carry this magazine to do you see yourself %HESITATION putting ads in this magazine so we already we did a mock up we ask questions so we know you're prototyping yeah  yeah invalidating so if you if you guys go into the software world it's like three words right you you %HESITATION ID eight  validate and iterate  and you go that virtuous cycle over and over and over again into you have gold  and set  %HESITATION  just a challenge the notion  now that yo's brands are not yellow let's talk about fruit a little bit I love what you do I really do but the more I see the way you brand the more I feel like it's just you talking to me which is great I love it I love it she has a great high energy brand something that most bands inspired to become fun approachable  not too serious that's great right  so for fruit  I I'm not I'm not gonna get this line right because I'm not a writer but it's something like this where you say good cookies get milk great cookies desertion paying something like that something like that doesn't that sound like yo come for me because I don't drink but that's what I mean it's like it is a reflection of these are good with milk others dimension pain demands men the men were those of people  writers who read that though yeah  and the question your prices  and for my client is boosting the bottom line see right guys thank you very much for tuning in and I would like to give a round of applause to yell  really appreciate  thank
