go ahead and bring on on stage I just like this you get you guys a little background story and how was your  there is a lot  yeah  right here yeah  go  for three years old  not  yeah early nineteen seventies  %HESITATION learn how to program  and the  he  this is an ad for  at the start of  right  the okay  all I ask the question  this is Alan was like maybe  you know he's an accomplice awesome cool guy he's not just like this thirty he  this  sold it review which is  Bill Gates from Microsoft now %HESITATION the programming languages no relationship at all to remember our nineteen ninety one reading homes will be sick and is released to the public and it changed Microsoft %HESITATION  reading on the spot and  %HESITATION let me see you %HESITATION this is from your from a programmer to design and build mine and she starts to sizzle doesn't desire his business takes off and he has more business than you can handle it shows that you know the maybe the demand is high doing something right  thank you for Allen and his wife do you live with his wife to launch her interaction design agency which is still around go ask very reputable great agency %HESITATION now what I can  this is a book called enough case  and then you guys by the  yes okay  this group would be awesome  at the seven thinking not without a there is a four forty four degrees and will be released on September second Allen likely generously  all four books  it's not released yet  %HESITATION will go for the agency will send it out to you guys a family film he's gonna sign so you get a signed copy  so that's basically musicians for dissing on October second  I have a nine inmates are running the asylum this is a lot of the local  on our media is  but  the mobile right back  I have a friend that's a month ends on file  hello  %HESITATION lives in the valley and %HESITATION kind of how that exactly like style nice house number he says forget as I'm going to live on a farm and then this way here who's in the audience  yeah  this is we  on the other  life is not  %HESITATION %HESITATION partisan wasn't the only one  and  %HESITATION  the only reason they were  the only son is here yes son but one of the  yeah  yeah it works yeah yeah that  I don't remember for profit so  as of the time  please hold time  they're often that I get really would like twenty of us in the role of  a I guess a little to really short stories the so you guys in my experience I %HESITATION what I said when I initially I was calling to speak at your site usually all sick of the speaker and his top off get to know them a little bit of what is left over in the  requires a flat and I had a choice is either needing Alan that were in the city which is the agency in the city or those last two hello mom was the only one and go check out the form and since I'm all about the adventure I am going to burning man after this  right now there's an item I was the farm  and this is my little  I guess the other and  people  yeah I was a  arm and sol or something just kind of see that my C.  well he %HESITATION  %HESITATION building and not from the love  and  on the ticket he said that there is no egg laying a you know you never sees a fresh  okay before and less you had it so  everybody edits  this is the only supporter of the farm tractors was cool this kind of life will never done this before but  %HESITATION gorgeous landscapes I did not notice over and it is at all  and most of the %HESITATION %HESITATION really very beautiful scenery  %HESITATION he actually has a fire truck that is on the phone using them and they use it to go to three %HESITATION so they raid that once a year  in school and this is Alan  animated  is there  so the %HESITATION goes on and now this is a work station as rock space or something  and let's see more scary  okay this matter that means you guys  okay  yeah I will make it doesn't  okay I'll hang out later  one of the factors into the low down so yeah  and they try to get them on and %HESITATION played but they have to do so yeah it is you need to ask me a lot  and also she is we're almost there to the end of the year the novelist in the scenic city is actually  Thomas  okay  okay so %HESITATION so close together %HESITATION if you need to get in touch with %HESITATION for how long  order Mr house for  yeah  as a looking for a job designs that earlier okay can also talk to this man  maybe that's okay yeah  so ladies and I would like to present  Mr  thank you so much for inviting me it's a pleasure to be here really I don't I have been speaking Leslie and %HESITATION but I really like what you're doing with you last time I think it's something that the city needs very much and I like that kind of that added to the the field that it has  I really appreciate you doing service to our our growing community and I'd like to thank all of you for coming on and I am deeply how little I mean kind about my life I've been inventor and entrepreneur and so I go wherever the crowds aren't in system in America see all your smiling face is here to see me that's like freaking me out but it's really means is that they need say wow it's really impressive thank you %HESITATION  I should also say thanks to  the error of the space is a little bit is the only one of  a year and a half ago these were  the three guys got it and  %HESITATION it's need  for an old building and %HESITATION it's just a few blocks down the street I mean I want to say that yeah ruby was a non of Monaco they met the real story behind that is that is that %HESITATION  is that when  letter pregnant with Scott suits said his name is Scott that sees that it's an old man in a  but yeah it's a girl  she's gonna be a really  but life is beautiful and %HESITATION so anyway so it wasn't in stock and then nine name of the software product those  yeah  okay and there is one thing that we agreed upon for this is to try to keep things on track  our golf and tennis so if I at all you're not doing it to get the information to you guys  yeah hi can all three  so then I say to me when I started going down and %HESITATION rabbit hole they say now and my wife invented this is give me the truth  some rooms these are not important  at the  it's very  there is a trade okay okay  on this night now %HESITATION if you go to wikipedia  this is for pioneer for someone else or is there some of the time  and %HESITATION first would like to start off by saying  what school what is that for some  I had a  personas are so is a New Zealand they're not that are the problem is is David in the evening misinterpreted by people with %HESITATION bull horns  and so most of the information that you hear about her so is wrong is wrong and it's wrong concept and it's wrong in detail and real personal as others and actually very little written about me over some of the most of them by name and %HESITATION but I  I don't know if I don't have a scientific or academic credentials so there's scientific and academic community hasn't paid much attention and being a solo practitioner entrepreneur with a small consulting company nobody really big organizations one we might have a so so the the problem the reason why you will hear people out there say personas are the single greatest design tool and you'll hear people say  they're worthless they're no good  this is like  what's going on and why is it like that is because most most people most  the Overton big that looks out of and misinterpreted and this and  yes %HESITATION  doing wrong when they %HESITATION so  what I have to do it design is not something that comes from your hand  design is solving the real problem in the real world you have to get out of the building  %HESITATION your users are and you have to figure out what they're trying to accomplish and not just what they're trying to  but the greatest insight into what they're trying to accomplish you get from understanding why they're trying to accomplish and what is their desire and stuff okay  once you go out and learn what you need is a way to express  okay so what you can use express statistically and that's been proven by many years of software development and not work  okay another way to do it is by doing what really users tell images and many years of summer Mel and improving that doesn't work either okay well you have to use you as a designer afternoon Randall all the desires of all of the users you have to understand whose desire so for most and what are the characteristics of the users that matter and which ones don't  and when you're done with that  you have a series of needs and wants and motivations and desires  and then you take those if you go to a meeting with the development of the man for the project manager that if you if you want all the  they say this is what I think we should do is make a well yeah but this is what I think we should do okay and programmers and to those in the online so you live  this is this is where this is where the person is a best  where you can take what you have learned and what you just still from your field  about who the user is and what their desire and states are in you horror let me enter this persona es  okay and then what you do is you take that persona you know this is less common doors suffered and you say  here  this  all of a sudden in the media is not you saying this is what I use the ones now you're saying daughter wants this and it's amazing how you know you you door with incredible authority  he's  scientists cognitive scientists have studied  it's not you anymore now it's this third party  it has incredible communications power has incredible power to do you use the self referential design in the personal  issues of all the constituents and it also allows you to test and develop  your work because it's like  this is a persona is like a character in a plan  you know if you're a terrible  what you need motivation  you need you need you need to try this for you need to go so you need to have the desired and stay  and what a good actor does  is that you get into that  this is why is this character fighting with that person why everybody loving that person wired the striving to do this and when you understand that what we can do as an actor is you can convey those feelings so you as a designer having gone out and found that most people don't want to dig around with file systems  they actually wanted to useful were  what you do is you start export resting what you want through character of the persona and because  revealing  people who are transformed in in drama are the actors  because there is an act out those motivations and you as a designer gold I gathered  either this is her make up I put on the drives and motivations and now I understand what that person wants a new look at the screen you  Carla interface or the product or the interaction in the behavior point whatever you're working on and you go does this mean radically somewhere and all  do you does your good if it doesn't you can get away  in the absence of how that's that's what we're so  yeah  what  what kind of questions are you would you asked to two different people you know  other stuff I really don't like  really good stuff  do not ask questions do not ask leading questions do say would you like this feature  that is that you are the bad  tell me about  tell me about your you know I I do a lot of this is offering something that's right number but what are you trying to accomplish very training go down so you'll notice that you can't really ask the question he asked a question people give you crap don't give the stuff that they didn't want to hear so it's what you need to do is you need to drink beer or  by  and so what you do is you say  you have a good day today  why  what made it located a grab  can you remember your last really good day where  yeah it is illegal all and you say you're  are you saying  good  one  and then shot up which I really are going to lose  and you'll learn our lesson that  so here  if you ask one person that you'll get all of their truths all of their fundamental truths  that are common  and you get all of their weird idiosyncrasy idiosyncratic stop  but I don't like blue and I hate beer you know that kind of stuff so then you going to talk to somebody else and he asked them these really open ended questions you let them talk tell me what is  what's it like which gives you a sense of satisfaction with life and  I'm  and you'll hear more common truths  and you also hear their idiosyncratic stuff  okay in after you interview a half a dozen people in some of your interview is will be  recalcitrant and some of them will be very forthcoming and and some of them will try to tell you what they think you want to know and what you'll be able to do is after you've interviewed a few people you'll you'll clearly see the patterns you'll see the common elements that people have and you'll see the crap that people are trying to sell you and you'll see the idiosyncratic stuff about beer in the color blue and you factor those out and what you're left with is a common set of desired and states  and then many people are you do you need to enter an order of the mind  you know it depends on whether you want the right answer the true answer the political answer  what do you guys want  everybody wants that one guy back there when the political and  we took a poll so it's a it's a big active now you %HESITATION %HESITATION eight people  %HESITATION  because because you'll you'll one of them will be a no show to a meal throat is out liars and that leaves five and you can clearly see patterns and five people if you can't see patterns in five people then you are  asking random questions that don't have a center of gravity  okay I mean if if what you're in luck if you're trying to invent something from whole cloth  you you can't go out you can't say  get decided to invent social media but nobody's ever seen social media before because it's nineteen ninety nine end up so you got you say well what would you like in social me you can't ask a question like that okay but if what you're trying to do is you're saying you know like let's say I'm the corporate social media %HESITATION Yammer you know and so now you you have a you have a you have a you know of a game field in which you're playing you can begin to observe things you can ask questions that are their relevant  %HESITATION  again you should see clear patterns for  within five interviews  if  if you don't it really means that you're not observing  it means that you're projecting or are there some communications problem %HESITATION  it means you're just utterly unfocused about what it is you're doing  the politically speaking we go into organizations and will often do thirty or forty or more interviews but mostly they're political we will go to an organization no se  you can interview the people in the San Francisco office you have to interview the people in the in the Boston office and in the in the in the Tokyo office you know because the people in Tokyo in Boston will feel slighted if you don't talk to Alan what's the two weeks I  eight a half  if  nice indeed like it  okay so if we're going to %HESITATION we're gonna run interview people how do we prioritize our users to know what is valuable and what's not valuable and %HESITATION are there are as mentioned in the book about face there are different types of personas %HESITATION that you say are primary secondary supplemental customer list on %HESITATION surfers on a no you're not interviewing persona  you're interviewing actual users or potential users or your competitors users  okay and what you're doing is you're creating your distilling a persona  as a vessel to hold what you have learned and to understand it to try it out into communicated  okay and %HESITATION  the the number one most important thing well  you need to get out of the  building is so many this is one of the one of the one of the falsehoods about personas that's been widely distributed which goes like this I can think up personas because their hypothetical  that is bullshit I believe is the technical term  what you have to do is you have to get out of the building and you have to listen  the people  not talk to them  I tell them what they want not tell them their options but listen and observe okay now what you'll find is there's this  huge distinction it's a huge distinction and there lots of lots of companies who failed to make it  there are users  and there are customers  and they're not the same  customers are really really important especially if you're in the business world okay and somebody inside your business really needs to pay attention to customers and at some level customers need to be satisfied  customers tend not to be  %HESITATION in certainly in in business and technical %HESITATION products they're not the people who are the users  and if you're selling  you need to pay attention to customers  if you are designing behavior and user experience you need to pay attention to users  okay what would be the difference if you're designing for an E. commerce site and then you're you're the users are purchasing something so they become a customer kind of the same thing right  no no no no no the the that's a good question let me let me  the distinction is that if you're creating ecommerce software you're selling it to a website builders and and online retailers  but they are your customer you work at the %HESITATION dear customer if you're working inside of like eBay or or Amazon your customer if you're you're  well it's not well okay  the the web blur is those distinctions  but it's important for you as a designer to understand whether your %HESITATION  whether you're hearing the customer talk or whether you're hearing the user top customers tend to want  they tend to think in terms of value  I want value and value tends to be I want more for my dollar I want more features a lot more capability of more stuff  okay Microsoft delivered more stuff than apple did  whoops  nothing is  does that make any sense  it's it's like delivering stuff turns out to be something that makes software developers feel really good  but it's not something to make users feel good and IT departments  we tend to their customers and they they they kind of go ahead I want I want to give my people a lot of features  but it's the users are the ones who have to wrestle with the stuff and they  I want to trip over all this extra features and  they're happy with stuff that makes you what people are willing to do is are willing to say well it doesn't have this feature does at that beach but I love it  okay most  software developers and the people who love them  don't understand that concept  they go %HESITATION but yeah yeah but you Love Me more if I could do for right  in the answer to that is well if you go out and you listen to your users you'll find out the answer as a resounding no  that in fact functionality is not the great motivating thing that has to work but also like what what it sounds like %HESITATION to me as we're talking about emotional design and some ways like %HESITATION  so being able to create a connection  with the customer is the and the person on the and they want to feel good about whether purchasing a cut is the customer making a purchase order user or user no matter where you're all users there uses buying out but but I I customers somebody who who %HESITATION goes out and buys a word press address  not somebody who who buys it shoes from sap us I'm gonna detour on this right here and say %HESITATION how how many of you guys have had the issue world  what how many do you work at a start up  and may  okay this is an issue I'm a designer as well %HESITATION that I've had which is that my job as a designer is to create the best value best products and it requires a lot of research and time  and thinking and brainstorming and going out and interviewing  customers users interviewing people  but a lot of sort of don't seem to get that that time is it has to be invested in order for them to have the best possible outcome how do we convince companies to allocate time for L.  for research I'm  wow  not companies but start up sort of that are scrappy here or they don't understand design how do we get them to understand  and if anybody else has and has anything they want to add to that  yeah that's a really difficult question it's a it's  the %HESITATION  the  it is a tough question nor is it is I know it is in and and the the answer to it is is is really simple we just don't bother  you know I mean I mean you know if  if you've got if you've got a colleague you know who who hates you because of your color your gender you want to get into it at a pitch argument with them to try to convince them you're decent person or do you want to just kind of walked away and let's let's make life a little easier  I well I have a different viewpoint on that which is %HESITATION I think that going if you want to change somebody's perception you have to change everybody else around use around you dating you changed everybody else's perception and the influence the inside yeah so %HESITATION  one way to do that is to find a start up that understands that they need to have open ears if they're going to succeed in the world or or educate the start ups so they can learn how to be home but you'd have to have a knack for educating start ups and start ups tend to have entrepreneurs in them and entrepreneurs are famous for being a hard headed individuals charging through the crowds and get out of my way I'm inventing the future which is the great strength in is the great weakness I think what you can do is you could you could ask some rational questions you know it which is which is do you want to have a successful business  if you want to have a successful business you're going to do it by doing good things for people who want you to do those good things for them and they will give you money  so how the hell did you proceed unless you know who those people are and what they want  and then you throw a tantrum and stormed out sorry I know this is I'm not necessarily very politically savvy here and that's kind of my approach is I would start yelling at people but  this is the thing is is that was bad advice ten years ago  you know because ten years ago the world of of of you X. design was was it was an embryonic profession and we held held on jealously to every %HESITATION employment opportunity we had today not so much there's look at look at us here there's lots of opportunities it's there's lots of jobs out there for first  designers and %HESITATION and and there are while it's still a tiny minority of the companies in the world understand our value there's enough of them  that I would just kind of  let the dinosaurs died  is that too  I think we can actually see one of my missions is to try to influence of entrepreneurs and those who are a pain in the **** who have given me  trouble all the stuff is from personal experience of like you spent fourteen hours on wire  like you know that after doing a ton of research %HESITATION  explain to them the value of it and even if for me this is a portfolio piece I want to feel proud of so even if I'm not getting paid sometimes I will put in that extra time just to make sure that I'm actually going to deliver something really good and then move on to the next project after a certain point but that's really interesting point and it's it's a  in my experience  all good designers all good practitioners in the high tech field which is  you know it may not seem like a times but it's it's owned by the practitioners all have that attitude I caught responsible craftsmanship which is  our goal here is not to do what we're told our goal here is not the color within the lines our goal here is not the you know supply the list of features or you know to put the you know to  do the required number of wire frames okay our job as we interpret it is to create great stuff  okay there's plenty of work out there  if for if if you don't want to do that if you don't care about being great you just want to you know the color in the lines there's plenty of jobs there's plenty of companies will hire you and they'll give you a nice title in a big salary and maybe even some options and then they won't pay any attention to you  okay but that's that's fine then you go home and you drink beer and you have a family and your IP okay but if you are a real  craftsman  then you believe that your job is to create greatness  and you will do what it takes to create greatness  why suffer fools  why not go where your greatness is appreciated  and there are companies will say %HESITATION that person's willing to work overtime good let's make it work overtime every night they're not appreciating greatness  you know you you want to go to a place that really values the fact that you care  %HESITATION at one another early Steve Jobs interview he said that a company  a group of he likes he loves working for Hewlett Packard because the company realizes that their biggest investment is their employees so they would bring them tell their place like doughnuts all the time and try to treat their plays really well so a good company you know we do have a lot of options here in in the Silicon Valley bay area %HESITATION if you're not happy with what a what you're with your job there are a lot of other companies that you can go to and if  for some reason you don't see yourself  developing like getting hired are getting the interest look at the people that are getting a lot of traction and try to craft your portfolio  toward more of what they have look with the market is up is asking for and make yourself more marketable it's not that you're gonna lack it is that you have to figure out what's needed them build yourself to that %HESITATION that's my motivational speech thank you of  so we're gonna go ahead and move into goal directed design which is all part of %HESITATION  personas falls underneath that but before four we moved forward  is there anybody was a question about personas because  yes what's your name how do you keep your ego out of your persona and how do you know you've succeeded that's a really good question arm  I'm not sure I know the answer to that question %HESITATION I think is that  I think the  %HESITATION  listen it's listening listening well it's the thing is is that is to be good at what you do you need to have your ego and  and so it's it's %HESITATION but it's it I again I would go back to this analogy of an actor a character actor who's trying to try on the new suit of clothes trial and the character you  you you have to  listen you have to  try  to  get the the users that you observe you need to get them to talk with you honestly not talk with you because people will bullshit with you and and what you need to do is you need to scrape it down to bare metal that's why I said you you you you drinking beer is a is a good thing is we typically find in our interviews that we schedule a little more than an hour because it usually takes about twenty minutes of talking before people will relax enough to say something  there is an  just out there and misleading and incorrect  but when you hear people really talking about what's really going on it sounds  flat and grounded and unemotional and it just rings of truth in it if you if you can't hear that then you need to get a different job you know because it should ring with with bell like clarity on and you will recognize it and when you hear three or four or five people do that you'll you'll very clearly get the you'll see you'll begin to see the patterns forming and certain so part of that %HESITATION does that sound like %HESITATION making somebody comfortable so they and not developing I know you talk a lot about empathy and the and %HESITATION about face  three which is the one that version that I read %HESITATION  is this is there are there are psychological tricks to making people more comfortable so they are horrible and yeah I'd  nobody in the  yeah no the %HESITATION actually you have to understand see I'm an old coder you know and and I'm a kind of a boy you know one of those you know borderline eighty D. you know guys whose whose but what I said earlier you know I don't like people what I mean by that is I much more comfortable in my workshop with my tool %HESITATION tractor or something that I am gonna room with a bunch of people and  and it's I kind of had this revelation not too long ago that that  he kind of thinking up this persona tool was actually a compensation of compensatory tool for me to get better at this empathy thing because people have empathy adjuster empathetic me I had to figure out a process and a mechanism in a you know an unnamed object that I could use that would would allow me to play the empathy game  that is anybody have anything to add of relating to empathy yes  what's your what's your name  how you guys got a drop in the beer  if you got what I say you don't have a method I I I you gotta understand I'm I'm trying to draw a distinction between me personally  and everybody else you need to have a method and you need to be able to perceive commonalities in the people you're observing I just happen to be not so good at it I'm good at inventing tools I'm a programmer you know that's what I do I make tools you should see my workshop  I do is I don't I'm like a ham radio operator you know goes out the ham shack to call other ham radio operators on his ham radio telephones new ham radio and so that's I'm a toolmaker so I go to my shop and I make you know tools to make my tools work better so I can make other tools and  that's just me what you need to do as it as a designer okay is you need to tune your ear  and practice listening to people active listening repeat back let me see if I understand what you just said and being open asking open ended questions never ask a closed in question and always ask questions that are like well what is that lie  you know when was the last time you did that you want to draw people out you want you want to get to narrative narrative as a key word and what we do because all behavior of all softwares essentially a narrative in humans are tuned to narrative we we seek it out and everything we we we we we do in in culture is is the is the creation of narrative and in good interaction design good user experience is the creation of a narrative and it begins with the narrative the narrative is I am dork soccer Berg and every time I sit down in front of my computer pull out my mobile I want to know what's going on with my community and I don't want to have to log in and go through all this extra overhead  okay well now you know something about what do you want to put in that log in screen or if you want to figure out a way to get dark September directly to his immediate results in  and %HESITATION it's a story  you begin to tell the story I dork wish to do this thing so that I will achieve this desired end state  you see and becomes a narrative it's a transformational story it's like death of a salesman  %HESITATION so what am I take one more question you're gonna click yes  with %HESITATION the questions over but %HESITATION sorry are you asking about deriving personas quantitatively which is that's it's a lot like killing for peace  I I'm not  I'm not dissing the value of quantitative research  I'm not a scientist I'm not a researcher  %HESITATION  but I value research that is done  but but but quantitative research has nothing whatsoever to do  with the design of behavior  directly  it's deep background  to educate you so you have an understanding may be of the people that you go out and observe qualitatively at the graphically it's  as soon as you start doing things quantitatively what you do is you is you short circuit the narrative  and you you and what you do is you put roadblocks in your way you can't get there if you say demographics  and persona in the same paragraph  your  blowing it  my wife said to be nice  so  demographics and personas have nothing whatsoever to do with each other  it's you know I tell this story as a  you know if you're LL bean you're on you're selling fly fishing gear you you you what you do is you go out to the what river you know the finest lye water in the northwest US and they're standing on a rock is a guy in his in his waders with this creole inn is bamboo rod that cost six hundred dollars  and it's a guy who lives for fly fishing in his when your best customers and he's a guy who works on the assembly line at the factory at that you know the Boeing plant right and  you want to know what motivates this guy okay well a hundred yards upstream is another guy sitting there news LL bean waiters in this create one is six hundred dollar bamboo fly rods and it's the it's Mister bowling he owns the company okay demographically  there's no similarity there's no comparison between the two  okay and if you look at them demographically you will learn very important and valuable things that you can use in the marketing and selling and get an inner workings of your organization okay but you will learn nothing  about designing waiters in creole and bamboo fly rods  and yet you can still find of the commonalities between these two guys out there on the on the fly water it's this is the essence of what you're  king for you're looking for the narrative the guy says he's they're just comfortable when I put a mark okay would you need to you need to  hi into that  why are they comfortable what makes them let me see you put them on miss you take a more let me see you know what about that brand over there you know and  and what you'll see is why he's putting one so I really like these are really comfortable well this button is really hard snap but I really like you've learned something you can improve your product that's the deserted that you're trying to get to quantitative can't get there just can't get there  we have a question I'm in %HESITATION we've opened this to more of a queue in a I might have some questions that are in there along the way but just just %HESITATION look in the back  I I would turn the question around did everybody here that it's about five year if you're designing for product that's going out in five years our personas useful I would just turn that around and I would say okay you're designing a product that can go out in five years how the hell do you know what's going on in five years okay now if what you're doing is you're making let's say you work for the Bridgestone company in your working on a new tread pattern for your all weather tire  okay you know what that's gonna look like in five years early yeah you can you can design that product for five years out and therefore personas will help you  okay  because what you need to know in five years you also need to know today what you need to know in five years you can note today okay  Hey you're designing social media  what social media gonna look like in five years I don't think anybody knows  and so what are your design tools your design tools are our rapid experimentation and getting crazy  okay %HESITATION de personas help you well yeah but you know sodas beer  all right I I'm a I'm a division between rod invention  and innovation and refinement and personas are are are top notch for innovation because they look you day let you understand a known constituency okay for raw invention of what you're gonna do is you're going to create you know a a a a a a floor wax and then go wait a minute it's a dessert topping you know what you know about floor waxes isn't going to help you in the dessert topping world but then again nothing else is  you know so you just got to do it cell  we have another of this book people walking to use your product otherwise you're just kinda over there smoking crack at your start up so you do know something about your users  so go listen to  get out of the building  sorry no that's okay I talked to because I'm just left I can do that seaman  %HESITATION no but basic basically you're saying that design for now not for the future like five years I mean tack isn't really used  don't know what's going to happen and we do a lot of designed for people who are doing like like %HESITATION clinical you know surgical tools and it takes five years of our end you know if you're trying to solve  %HESITATION %HESITATION to detect prostate cancer you know well detecting prostate cancer today is the same as detecting prostate cancer in five years so personas are really useful tool  it depends on on your arena and what problems you're trying to sell  okay  we had another question are right back yes did there's this user to two questions and make sure I answer so the first one we'll just go with this one for now because it's one question per person body %HESITATION so eight eight people is is that the how can you know is this is coming from discuss calling to it's it's the people who I think statistically and they they haven't drilled into their heads that the only way you can know something with any certainty is it has to **** validity we are not living in a world of statistics here I mean statistically you know if you have one point seven parents and two point three children but you don't  okay what we're trying to get at here is not the average or the mean we're trying to get at the truth we're trying to find out what makes you fall in love you can't do that through statistics because this guy falls in love for one reason and this woman falls in love or another  if you average them all out  you know you get as Singaporean beauty contest winner  Lehrer do you not surf the internet what  okay %HESITATION somebody in the back %HESITATION is there any questions back there yes  the question is after you have a persona what's the next step you take  %HESITATION  what you do is once you have a persona  what do you have when you have a persona  if you read that **** up at Microsoft Pruitt Gruden in that book what you have is you've got a poster on the wall with a bunch of meaningless statistics and facts about that person in the drive a blue Chevy in there thirty two years old and doesn't tell you anything  okay but if you have  a  a real persona what you have is a single individual person  with the real name  that's all you need in terms of facts  and you'll know what their desired end state is  I want to know when my body is going to show up at the pub  I don't wanna have to enter all this information I don't have to okay a weather uses my location I don't want to have to do all this stuff I don't have to sign in through Facebook I just want to know when Jerry's getting here  okay yeah let's just pretend for an instant that you're an interaction designer what do you do you put on the screen winter is getting there it's not that hard the thing is is this the world we live in is all about figuring out the question  figuring out the answer is really easy you should be able to figure out the answer will yeah thats obvious how you do it  okay the hard part is what is the question so the whole point here is  the by the time you've got a persona  you should know  okay so what you do is you then do some sketches you go to your white board you want some you know high through put you know high read as interactive  %HESITATION  you know communications mechanism that's why like pencil paper white board and what you do is you draw something you know this is what my phone looks like okay  when you click on it and you go okay I'm I'm dork and I want to know when Jerry's gonna show but the puck and so I just click on this button do I now know with Jerry showing up at the pub you ask yourself whether you have brought your persona door Drucker bird to his desired end state of knowing when Jerry's going to show up in the pop  if you have your gold and you've done design and you've answered that question if you haven't you go back  and he takes it well what have we put up a little map  and then you say okay now in you role play you step through  %HESITATION the play acting you say okay I'm dork I want to know where Jerry as I can now see on the map the jurors three blocks away he's walking you no worries eight blocks away he's driving %HESITATION it's got a park this is going to take a long time  is that answer your question starts October down no  ask yourself that question in the thing is is is it's it's cheap it's rapid you get a rate you're not iterating in software you're you're reading and in thought games and role play which is really really powerful and it doesn't have a lot of hysteresis so if you're wrong you could move right along and try to get try something different when you finally gets hats looking good this is telling me that he's on foot is only three blocks away and it gives me an estimate of six minutes and it also tells me in the last five times I've I've I've met up with Jerry at a bar he got lost and he was ten minutes late  eat up some on what you know now you're sitting there you go well I'm delivering some value here okay  the the next step should be easy I'll tell you if you're doing that Microsoft in style of a persona stuff you know the persona lifestyle where what you do is you do you design a feature and then you create a persona that wants it  we were in Microsoft's turf right here so Microsoft can yeah very young age the Microsoft India accidents cleared this with the with the with Erin earlier he said given hell Harry  and they get back this is I mean no this is the thing is it is that there's is it in nineteen ninety nine I publish the inmates you know where I was the only guy who ever does  scribe personas and how they're created now they're used and how they work and what they do and I hear it I less than a year later Microsoft was a blaze with the idea of persona and I went up and visit and they asked me to come up and talk about persons all these guys are standing around but %HESITATION Mister Cooper look at the person we have and I went oh my god they've got it all wrong  what they're doing is they're saying we're really smart Microsoft developers and we've invented all these wonderful features and we've got a persona for every feature  and then they publish this huge book just encapsulated this in a lot more authority than I ever gave it in chapter nine of the inmates and and there are thousands of people out there in the field who've read that book and others like it  personas our goals and goals are personas you discover personas the way you discover their goals personas are expressions of users goals goals are embodied in people their bodies in personas how do you write a four hundred page book on personas without using the word goal I don't know  so I created the design process called the goal directed design process because it's based on this fundamental idea that I don't care and it doesn't matter what you want Mister technical provider of services and goods  what matters is what the end user wants what they desire what motivates them what their goals are what's their desired end state and you can learn an enormous amount by way  up in your head around that  is a and what a persona is is just a convenient platform for you to express those goals which are the reason  of for existence for your reason for existence as a user experience designer to satisfy those goals  truck blame on no those wonderful %HESITATION I can't read thirty watch the video on this and then just keep  like and and betting all this information Sir I remember it okay %HESITATION we have two more questions and then we're going to go into a contest I just want to say that I'm sure the John proves a really nice guy and I know that his partner Tim Allen is a very nice person very nice to me they just got it wrong what can I say  well letting them know that they have it wrong is the first up route are you here to change training and %HESITATION bass off by changing it to make it right %HESITATION there's nothing wrong with that at all %HESITATION yeah right  you have a question  well why would you have to sell personas to stake holders  yeah  start the phone number of the stakeholder no they're not personal opinions personas are not personal opinions personas are derived from your exhaustive and expert research I don't like the term research because because it implies that you're a scientist in this isn't science so I like to use the term field study but that doesn't make them any less exhaustive and it doesn't make them any less expert and it doesn't make them any less truthful and if you have state colder  who tell you to go out and do your job and then reject portions of your expertise in your job I say to you why are you not working on your resume  but you are the stake holders are they the V. sees are there anything else they call it we have a lot of designs or new stakeholders here why would you as a stakeholder say to a designer stop doing what I pay you a lot of money to do  it's not about opinion is it  well hold on a sec are do you have a question of all of your sorry I want to know so we're talking about like the stakeholders we talk about the investors and is that what we're referring to you in terms of stakeholders or the the CEO any stakeholders is a euphemism for your boss your boss okay so so basically we're talking we're having the same discussion which was how do we convince our boss to give it to give us time to research well feel slightly %HESITATION go out and get it collected data not that up sorry information and get to know people and what their what their wants and needs are you know right you know what I would do is I would %HESITATION thing for the top  I would go and find a decent job at a company that respects me but  why not just do an expert and say well that's a B. roll this you know let's let's build your way and let's build it my way  you know the thing is is if your boss hires you to do your job and then  second guesses you  I don't get that  the thing is is look you don't have to build Purcell  you know  personas are a convenience and you don't have to make your personas public you don't have to go to your boss ago I am going to be really good at my job because I do Purcell okay because they made up I ended  okay but what you do is you say what's my job what am I supposed to do here  you know if they want you to hit it with the pretty stick you don't need persona and you don't need to get outside of the building but if your job is to create a successful product you have to get out of the building you have to listen to your users  that's what you have to do unless  there's a single exception to that and that is if you're building what I call a mud hut on another planet I've also been known to call it the dancing bear you know it's a Marvel not because the bear dance as well but because the bear dances at all so if you're the first person who can cram you know thirty two gigabytes on a chip the size your fingernail you don't have to offer good behavior  okay because your immediate competitor six months later they will and they'll eat your lunch  okay so you only have to offer good behavior if you want to stay in business not if you want to succeed  so this is an old argument it's an old old argument  and the people who advocated are the people who assert their manliness  it's an ego thing this goes back to your question about how do you get ego out of your work I've not seen that  as a problem but I have seen a lot of ego in in in the Old World of industrial management there was a there was a class distinction management made the decisions of the workers in the execution okay we're in the post industrial world where the practitioners at the bottom most levels are often smarter than more highly educated in definitely know more about the problem at hand then any managers the job of management is much more complicated than it ever was because it's one of supporting and communicating and focusing the one thing that management does not bring need to bring to the table is decision making because they're not equipped to do it right they don't know enough they they're not deeply involved with the issues the way practitioners are and so you see this all the time yep stake holders making decisions and what that is is that's their ego getting in the way that's old school think it's old MBA think it's crusty old dinosaur stuff is I'm supposed to make the decisions around here I'm calling it the way I see it and I don't buy it and I recommend that you just kind of like go to a place where they don't do that because life is too short and not all work on convincing them to live well you you know you know there's there's a lot of money to be made out there you know do you know you know carrying the the the the the the bridal veil of you know Hitler's wife you know you can you can you can you can go out and do stuff that is like really unpleasant and you can make a lot of money and have a fine job  good Tara okay so well we don't have but right now we're gonna  questions getting late but %HESITATION  we're saying is that apply applicables per person knows to be applied can first one is the applied to a non human  like a dog or cat  they were trying  okay yeah behavior right living thing with behavior  I I don't have a clue I yeah okay  we're going on with the help that we have all of the old  but that's really interesting I'll tell you something I've been living on a ranch with animals for the last three years and I can tell you that what you think you city dwellers and what I used to be up until three years ago pretty much everything I knew was wrong and I would venture to say everything you guys about animals is wrong and we tend to enter more fights and we're we're terribly off base on that stuff so I wouldn't I would probably say probably not  I I think I disagree and think that you could study the behavior of an animal because it's the same you're listening and watching them and observing them and seeing what motivates them to do something and maybe and sort of your not necessarily designing like a product but maybe you know some weights and get them to go to the bathroom outside so that's I don't know okay no we have four books that are given away and that means that we can bring  mom  but if we're done here time I think it's your time Allen thank you so much I can't wait to watch the video and just like every thank you thank you thank you everybody  there's a lot of
