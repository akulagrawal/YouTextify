welcome everyone we're going to talk today about not listening to users about sampling their experience  three years ago I worked I started working in a Google search %HESITATION before that I worked in in ads for two and a half years and we started getting more and more interested in what people want to know  because what you saw on the video  is what people actually do on Google because it's a parody but this is what people actually do we want to know what they want to know with or without connection to Google so a team came to me and we started planning this and since then we've been doing a study that we call internally then that stands for daily information needs  and this has been going on since then in the US and in other countries around the world  with we pretty much ask our study participants is this question what did you want to know recently and we asked this question over and over again during a few days and we ask a lot of people we asked this question  we even have %HESITATION tee shirts for that then project %HESITATION internally at Google hi my name is Donna Sheron I'm a Google search user experience researcher and today we're going to talk about the method called experience sampling  the problem I want to start and talk a few minutes about the problem that we have  the problem is that people listen to users  what I call is to not listen to people  opinions or ask them any questions about the future would you use something instead I call for observing behavior  and I want to talk a little bit about why I don't listen to users because of what I know about the psychology of the difference or the relationship between attitude and behavior  attitude is what people say they do and behavior is what they actually do  here's one study this was done in nineteen thirty seven the researcher went into classrooms and ask students  would you cheat in an example  and they answered a few weeks after that got back to the same students and together with the teachers they were giving the students an opportunity to cheat without them knowing that that you know the they're being tracked  and surprise surprise  there was close to zero correlation between what people said that about their future behavior and their actual behavior  this was nineteen thirty seven at seventy seven years ago  something from twenty twelve researchers in the UK and this was done with dozens of thousands of people in the U. K.  went into a public bathrooms in gas stations all over the country  when they ask people coming out of the bathroom did you wash your hands after you finished your your business and ninety nine percent of people said yes  however  they also installed electronic recording devices inside the bathrooms and they actually counted how many people wash their hands  and again thirty two percent of men and sixty four percent of women really did wash their hands now there many reasons why this is happening  lying is not one of them  okay usually people are not intentionally lying about their behavior  with just a very bad at predicting it  now I wanna take you into the start up world I've been interviewing a lot of people  in the start up world in the arm what I found is this  this is the main the main finding  entrepreneurs have no time or budget to spend on learning from users  this is what I what I observed and I interviewed a hundred fifty start up founders and feces because I was so surprised by what I hear what I heard from from start ups in I also talked with the season I was even more depressed but  I want to share the other primary findings from this %HESITATION from these interviews only twelve percent of them  new what is user experience  and I was very generous I ask them a direct question in your opinion what is the definition of user experience and they gave me their answer  I was very generous in invalidating their responses and even after this generosity only twelve percent of them really knew the find it very well  another finding a start up idea is born from the founders personal pain eighty six percent of start up founders start their start up because they had a problem  okay now it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just a finding it could be bad if they're convinced that the entire world has this problem in many cases they are convinced that this is so  I also asked  what are other reasons that you started your your start ups this is what I found the personal pain eighty six percent and use the research is down there with with two percent meaning that they did research to identify user needs and then they came up with an idea based on what they found %HESITATION in between spin off they started a company and then pivoted or change it completely %HESITATION started a new company %HESITATION based on what they did  our requests from clients clients came to them and ask them for something and they started a company or they read a market research reports but the main result here is that it's solely based on personal pain  what I saw is that ideas are mostly for products or services  there was close to zero %HESITATION percent of of the people I interviewed  who fought about a problem  the problem to solve and started with this  here's  opening that they think about the problem before they started and you can clearly see that who knows what this is except for that it's a phone yep  it's a jitterbug phone yeah what's special about the jitterbug phone  it's for all the people who have a hard time reading  I agree it's even more than than just hard time reading  they have big buttons here  it's not the size of the phone but it's not far from it it's really really big  are the letters are the font is really big there's this cover here  all of this can you think why why they're doing this  why are all these a special features what is the prior knowledge  a phone for complete novices  but they don't know  they have no neither concept of of of modern smartphones yes  they have real physical needs for different with four different types of interfaces why  I argue that there is for every new product  there's prior knowledge that people apply to using this new product  what is the prior knowledge of elderly people when they use this  that's a problem what is their knowledge  push button land line I would go even further back  this is their prior knowledge  now let's compare these big fonts  and then there's the thing how many of you saw  elderly people use a smart phone like this  you saw that  that's for a reason that's the reason  because it worked its way to reach their their mouth and here and this is what they did here this cover here this this a great cover here is to block the noise exactly as you could have done with this and there are other other features that are just easier for people to use it's not based on prior knowledge but it's based on what is that they don't have %HESITATION everything here is is a yes no questions  they type they dial the phone number and then it asked them call and there are two yes no of buttons so it's all very kind of conversation also they don't need to understand if you remember the buttons back then send the end or figure out different different icons icons and what they mean  so this is based on fundamentally understanding a problem  these are the questions app developers and start up founders ask themselves these are great questions that they ask themselves ninety seven percent ask what my customers ninety five percent pass a critical question do people need my product  an eighty nine percent ask if the product is usable or not  and other questions  bass and drive and the passengers can actually stay warm  so she picked out her sketchbook right then and there and begin drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper  no it's a product designer I try to learn from people like merry  try to see the world the way it really is  not the way we think it is  why because it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees  but it's hard to solve the problem that almost no one sees  now some people think you're born with disability or you're not  as if Mary Anderson was hard wired at birth to see the world more clearly  that wasn't the case for me I had to work at  during my years at apple  the job challenge this  to come in to work every day  to see  but this is the problem  the way people answer their quick great questions is extremely invalid and unreliable and I want to share some of these %HESITATION answers and some of them are funny but they're they well represent the answers I got in a hundred and fifty interviews  who are my customers the way they answer it is analytics an assumption personas they invented personas inventive personas are personas that are based on nothing  based on intuition not on research  analytics they they go through demographics  and this is how they know who their customers are  do people need my product again a critical question and there are ways to answer it with research this is how they answer it and I'm not getting  is the product usable  we focus on you ex you really really really really focus on you X. meaning that it's good  we use it ourselves is another answer we know if it's usable or not  we the founders we the company is our product better than the competition  after a ten minute argument that they have no competition and we think that they do have competition without even knowing them they agree and answer a we do things differently can't compare  and if if we can't compare we compare feature lists we look at the competitions website and we see a long  list of features we compared to ours and then we know who's better  is a product getting better  we prove it all the time so yes  and the people want the product which is by the way a question I'm not really suggesting you ask because what people want doesn't really matter what matters is what they need and it's always different  and the yeah I I kid here but this is what they do they ask friends and family members and friends and family members are very nice to you they want you to succeed but they're really biased so that's a problem  all of this means one thing that's a huge risk that they're taking  huge risk  he's not going to catch it right  and these start ups develop products that nobody nobody needs  and they're executing the wrong plan  you you came here I know you never did that right  but just in case you do  I want to introduce you to experience sampling  experience sampling is what's called the strategic research technique at its strategic because it's looking at I'm covering user needs it's not evaluating a product or design that we currently have  so in the tent project  what we did is this we asked people the same question over and over again what did you want to know recently  and we saw this I'm I'm I can't share the data but  %HESITATION tenet and and the size doesn't really represent the data but  we have two parts of of answers one part is what people search on Google that they shared with us  and there's another part of what people want to know that Google can't give them today  and these are two examples what they do on Google is things like not just of course but barackobama heights and %HESITATION was very good with thousands of types of of of questions or queries such as that  but they also want to know for example what type of writer and my  Google can give this to them today  so all of this what people want to know that they can't do today is an opportunity for us  and this is extremely indicative of user needs  experience sampling is a research technique where you interrupt people's daily lives and asked them to notice note their experience about something in our case this was what did you want to know recently  it's very good for identifying needs for understanding what features people needs okay not comparing feature lists to competition  and foreign covering current pain points and the lights  here's here are the ingredients this is what %HESITATION what you need to do to run an experience  I'm playing study and it's not really hard  first you need to very carefully think about the question that you're asking it's really really important again in our example we asked what did you want to know recently we also ask this was the lead question we also ask some more questions for example why because some %HESITATION answers we learned are are not really telling us a lot and I'm going to give a few examples later  we also asked people for example %HESITATION if a picture better explains your answer take a picture and send it to us  and so on and so forth we asked a few other questions were you with other people or who needed the information and so on and so forth  generally speaking we planned each notification to take about one minute to answer not about up to one minute to answer because otherwise people feel overwhelmed we asked the question on a five eight times a day  if it's a burden that they will participate  now there's a question how many times do I ask them it depends on how many answers you want so and it depends on the on the activity that you're looking after %HESITATION it that you're looking at so for example if it's what did you want to know recently  I claim that people want to know hundreds maybe thousands of things during a typical day we only ask the question five or eight times  but if it's what was the reason you recently updated your website  that might not happen several times a day so you need to kind of do some reverse mathematics and start with how many answers you want by the end of the study that say you want to thousand five hundred answers and %HESITATION and then you can start dividing that say you have a hundred participants and then you decide that okay I'm going to send it to them five times a day for five days then you get to two thousand five hundred because some of them will be garbage and and and things you don't understand but %HESITATION this is how you calculated  carefully choose a medium  text messaging email and apps of phone message you can call them  and ask them to or ask them to call you and leave a message  it these are all valid %HESITATION ways the  primary thing you need to to think about in advance is how are you going to collect the data because if it's a text message that you then need to copy and paste into a spreadsheet that's not gonna work with two hundred two thousand responses so think of a way a good way to do that %HESITATION  ask them to fill a form with one question or something like that and then it goes into a spreadsheet or if you are more capable %HESITATION you can use %HESITATION if if you heard about it and and things like that but think about it in advance don't find yourself a copying and pasting two thousand responses  we used Paco Paco is an app %HESITATION  an android app for sure %HESITATION not sure if there's an iOS version yet I know they're working on it or worked on it  %HESITATION publicly but available posco stands for personal analytics companion and also the name of the dog of the developer and %HESITATION it's an app that allows us to send the two figurations and and manage this whole experience happened process really easy  decide how to collect the data in a spreadsheet %HESITATION or something like that  now  participants I mentioned a hundred dissidents or or participants in general you need to carefully think about participants and what you gonna do with them how many we talked about that expectations they need to know what you expect of them  you need to brief them not too much you don't want to give them examples of answers because this way you're only going to get these examples stay vague with with regards to what you want them to share or how you want them to answer but do you explain that you expect them to answer each time and to answer all the questions that that you ask and answer the question in a way that would make you understand what they mean  practice  a couple days before the study send the question once  and and see what you get and if they are participants who are not really giving you what you want to work with them on that  give them an incentive an incentive at Google we pay him but %HESITATION %HESITATION and we have money to pay and I know a lot of small companies don't have the money to pay to them I say  and so incentive is not  this is the early money  if you're a startup a small start up if you have an office create a wall of fame of people who helped us with research put their names on it take a picture and send it to them people love their name  that would be a great incentive if you don't have an office have a a web page for that the wall of fame of of study participants who helped us on your site  the moment you're thinking about research in general and experience sampling specifically because if it involves a lot of participants start recruiting them find them start finding them  there are ways to do that I'm not going to describe that now because it's a it's gonna take me awhile but start recruiting your participants as soon as possible recording finding people to participate in research is the biggest bottleneck of research  let's talk about the analysis we talked about how we collect the data who we do with with and what you do with them let's talk a little bit about the analysis so we need to decide  on categories that you're going to classify the data so imagine you're getting two thousand responses now you need to do something with them what you do is classified them into different categories  we had in in the daily information needs study we had forty plus categories before we even started with the fines and with with with real specifics the specifics what are the categories and one of the options in each category  let's say let's take an example so let's say they  this is our experience sampling question what frustrated you the last time you went grocery shopping  so here are some categories  the location to be one category where the frustration took place and options might be %HESITATION the ones you see here home way too from storing car parking lot and at the store another category would be a close people friends and family who might be involved spouse roommate kids  another one with the people at the store so you look at each response any classified by these categories I'm gonna show you how you did that in a second so people at the store could be other customers can shear store service personnel and so on and so forth and what was the issue finding items understand it costs and long lines this is just an example  so what you do with it  you classify each and every response let's say this is one of the responses  I asked the question what frustrated you in in your recent grocery shopping experience and this is one answer a slow kiss year combined with an elderly pass person who was in front of me on the line calls me to be late to pick up my son from school all right so how do you classify that so the location is at the store close people are kids people at the store other customers and the cashier and the issue was long lines  so you kind of disassemble each and every response into its components  and  as you do that you learn that your pre defined categories are not so good sometimes you need to merge them sometimes you need to split them sometimes you need to create a new one sometime you need to %HESITATION get rid of a few that's fine do that  clean the data as you go  dogs is an answer we got to the question %HESITATION what did you want to know recently  we have no idea what dogs mean  so %HESITATION so you need to clean this data this is an answer to the the frustration at the grocery store %HESITATION question  has nothing to do with what you need so clean that they  and generate what's  she needs help yes  yes  and then you can generate frequency charts based on your classification you kind of re assembling the data in a meaningful way so you know what happened most so maybe if long lines is the main problem maybe you need to do something about it  and you'll see that you'll very quickly identify themes and what you need to do another way of doing that is what's called eyeballing the data just reading the responses gives you a lot of information understanding about what happened there  this is an example of these are our responses to this question what was the reason you recently used a piece of paper to write something down and this is how you very quickly I ball the data into groups some people are making lists some people writing ideas some people are sketching stuff  if you want to read more about this you know almost nothing about the experience sampling at this point  if you want to read more about it %HESITATION this is a a a a book I recommend %HESITATION  the last guy there is a ten speaker he speaks about other things %HESITATION at Ted he speaks about flow %HESITATION but this is a really good book to understand %HESITATION experience sampling one second  so experience sampling is what's called reality mining you mind the reality of your users  it helps you fall in love with the problem which is critical to solving a real problem that people care about  and I know this is the distribute  %HESITATION sandbox so let's make at least one connection here  if you solve a real problem people care about I think it's very it's very helpful in terms of distribution  so last thought  I don't just believe everything I say because I stand here tried out on your own it's almost as easy as it sounds  thank you
