designers feel that the grave process has become quite sterile and like you X. hassle taking way the kind of the creativeness of it said before and design would go to a college and and everything about that was that they crave prices coming intently but not having seems to be validated and everything to be like very sterile and the way we create things is all about replicating the same user experience patterns and you I elements and  and it feels like the validation Paul has taken away what it means to be creative at from developer perspective I must say the days were helpful %HESITATION so I personally like it I like to you know have hard proof that the what I'm working on or decisions I'm making are having the direct impact on the user experience on the up I'm building or on the look and feel but I can totally see where you're coming from %HESITATION when it comes to the creative process for example it's quite important and easy to measure stuff that is already out there to figure out if the decision was right or wrong but it's very hard to start with data and not to start the process of creating something new %HESITATION from heart fox you need this in GT that you put into the up in the first place for example when I create some as a reference up %HESITATION I want to showcase some technology or some new way of solving technological problem %HESITATION but as a front end up so I need to make it look and feel nice at the same time  and they send this brand converse and then I pray to have some creative design there next to you know coming in with his ingenuity rather than just you know getting my data and following the data flow I mean does feel a bit like a chicken and egg situation what comes first the creative step of just discovery I actually like to think about it as a sandwich and all other than she can I is like  if you have some bread and then some feeling and then some bread again so I think it all starts with kind of creative process %HESITATION by design or by some you know creative person that is working on a given product home to have a D. starting idea and then you get data and user testing go and all this you know heavy weaponry for %HESITATION  wishing the original idea so that it's the best %HESITATION you can get but then at the top you still own the dispatch of ingenuity and all like when I think about different %HESITATION visual frame marks on the web they kind of stop and this second layer they took the initial idea they applied a lot of data to make it as nice and you know to use and as usable and this browser friendly environment friendly whatever and you need and they stopped there but then designs to take such a visual framework and stash the something unique in all that to make a given the op or product outstanding and and sometimes I think we stop at the state level and we don't go through this extra step of heading somewhere aren't on top of it to make it extraordinary amazing I mean I've never ready for that I would always feels like one comes before  or the other and I know and I love working environments to feel like a factory in that respect that I draw the picture than a developing my implement the picture and then I take it back and say could you change the color back in and I think I suppose it's about finding a a a a process with both can really feel like they're making a sign which together in a kitchen rather than it being a conveyor belt  it's a little bit similar to when the engine methodologies and third the software wall to know where you go through different iterations of the %HESITATION of the creative process and I agree when there was said the situation of our first to get the design out and then you give it to developers to implement it and that's it is very stressful for both sides because %HESITATION developers who stressed that the design is not to be implementable to be honest like is not compatible with the technology and then design their starting grid because you know developers change their design and now it's not the prettiest it was before so I think it's all about making it more iterative and more collaborative and then it takes the stress out of both parties  and I know there are some there's some tension on the line every now and then %HESITATION but to be honest I really like working with designers and there's this up I worked on %HESITATION in December last year at Santa tracker it's %HESITATION it's a Google up that %HESITATION kind of trucks the steps of the Santa Claus throughout December up to the communication they where he goes around the world you know and gives the presence and and there's a lot of ops you can play and in that experience throughout the whole December and I was developing this up  we're a little %HESITATION elf is going through a maze is navigating a maze finding presence and you can look at it Doug do you see the elf from the top so it's pretty much just the result of a little pointy hat  and kind of and my task was to make its jump through obstacles and I was totally stock and all that because you look from above and is just this red dot that is ahead how you make a jump into lakes you don't see arms I was I was stuck I implemented all the technological parts to it in two days and then for next week's I was like blank how to make it look right and the last four designer help and within a very short time he came up with the idea that you know if you make the dough to bigger and they're smaller looks like you know it's like floating in the air and then falling dollars this is so brilliant and I never thought about  thank you really need to and  trust in your competencies to them and ask for help when you need it  and what I love for us to do is to end up in a world where we have language and ideas that are native to the web itself embrace the fact that the web is hypertext not just a another way to build me to that
