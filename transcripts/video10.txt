action okay sure so I'd like to talk about your business idea today that you have %HESITATION I know a little bit about it from the research that I've done before this interview but it's always good to hear about it %HESITATION in your own words so that I can fully understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish makes sense %HESITATION first off could you explain in your own words what this project is  well yeah this project is called blockbuster move it's a business that I developed %HESITATION it's essentially a way for young people to develop like high scale theme parties %HESITATION with a planner so it's kind of like  you know like a personal fitness trainer something somebody's gonna maximize your workout will maximize your party and we do see matic parties based on sales %HESITATION we provide that content %HESITATION activities so on and so forth cool that sounds great and what's your role with this project did you conceptualize this idea conceptualize it and I sort of have final say on one ships and what we actually decide on for for content which movies we DO essentially the CEO of a team of people that work with your correct  we're going to create a website  for this project yeah yeah we want to be able to have a strong web presence and reach as many possible clients as we can so  sounds good who is this product for and what do you see your key demographic being  well the way we conceive of it is this product is for younger people who %HESITATION  when I have an active social experience but are maybe not as inclined to go out into the world so maybe young parents or people are into controlling their party experience their environment %HESITATION but also the nerd demographic you know young people who enjoy content %HESITATION and you want to sort of incorporate that into their social behavior so we're thinking you know %HESITATION  mid twenties to forties because you know  the nerd age is getting older and older but %HESITATION  yeah just anyone who is looking to have %HESITATION interactive and Larry S. party  great  would you define a success for this website rework presence if we could sponsor and launch  you know  ten to fifteen parties within the next  five months we'd be reconsidered that success is just a matter of building our client base getting the word out there about what we do and %HESITATION  you know closing some deals made some sales great and do you imagine that with a good web presence and with referral and word of mouth that your business will continue to go from there what do you see as success in the future for you two years down the road  yeah well I think I think our business will grow based on word of mouth I think that's the kind of thing  that %HESITATION lends itself well to this kind of business because people have an experience and they want to share you know that's the whole deal with the party it's like you cultivate a social experience documents when you share it so I think  social media will provide sort of a %HESITATION  %HESITATION support role serve a specific unseating role to what we do on this website to the packages that we provide for people and in two years time we love to upscale to larger venues to large groups of people may be you know interact with businesses office parties things like that we're definitely willing to expand as of now the stock we provide in the scale is is more of a personalized trip domestic product but we love to expand and do more serious work %HESITATION  yeah you really the numbers will will show it like out however many clients we have what we sell as long as were increasing in revenue to this yeah satisfactory percentile from  from quarter to quarter then I think we need to change great  your biggest worries when it comes to this project specifically that site and your web presence well execution is everything so if we put something online  online that we want people to engage with and the party goes poorly because the website doesn't provide an accurate depiction of what we do  that it's all going to crash and burn because of a lot of what we're relying on a social media sharing word of mouth so it's really important we make it clear what our mission is and what we actually do I don't want people thinking they're going to have you know  Marty McFly show up to their house and %HESITATION having backed the teacher party I want them to understand the parameters of what we do know what to expect %HESITATION so it needs to be flashing exciting but so realistic and reasonable so or we're not trying to  push your product that we don't actually fall through so there is a danger there it's kind of a bouncing  yeah it sounds like you are pretty focused on the social media component of it would you like that to be part of your website as well or would you be  we can figure out how to do that clicking corporate whatever you want but I think it's important to bring interactive elements to the website and is that something you'd be interested in absolutely absolutely I think as many social media platforms as we can %HESITATION tied to our product you know the more the better %HESITATION yeah because I think a lot of it like I said is it is going to be about just the social all %HESITATION  the social energy around the product itself and how it propagates on its own %HESITATION once it's in the hands of the consumer so if we can connect to social media through our website that's fantastic  what are you thinking about a time line for this project and I know when thinking about %HESITATION time lines and functionality both are important if you could pick one %HESITATION is it more important that we get a grip a good website out there for you so that you have a web presence or is it more important that we focus on really getting all of those pieces of the website functioning well before we watch well I think I would rather have something that people can go check it out sooner rather than later if there if you can send you to be worked out down the line some development flies I would rather get the product out there even if the  the nature of the delivery system is in perfect so that people can start party as were all about about people having  the time and having the means to have a good time and being the facilitator of that you know and parties are %HESITATION spontaneous and exciting and they're supposed to be energy so as long as the product is there an is available I think %HESITATION server working out the Kinks as we go is certainly acceptable %HESITATION I'm excited about this idea I want it to happen quickly the quicker the better is how I look at great well thank you for meeting with me today I think I have information to start working on this and we can meet %HESITATION throughout the course of the project I'm looking forward to working with you  thank you
