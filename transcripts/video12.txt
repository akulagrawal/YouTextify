hi this is Fred Simonsson and he is the general manager for victory tool in America Minnesota  so %HESITATION stay were going to talk a little bit about %HESITATION his project which is a new %HESITATION website or revamp of the current website and %HESITATION so first of all Fred tell me a little bit about your company what do they do tool bills metal stamping dies %HESITATION metal stamping dies stamp all metal components for Connors %HESITATION ATVs computers anything %HESITATION that uses metal metal stamp components okay and how big is your company our company is has about twenty eight employees we the revenue is around sort of five million dollars a year okay %HESITATION so we're gonna go through a couple questions just to gather some information and do a little bit of research %HESITATION for our for this project %HESITATION so the first question that I have for you is %HESITATION well we know it's going to be a website %HESITATION the website you currently have was tell me a little bit about that how did that come together well when we acquired the company at the first of the year %HESITATION we we acquire some my company there was much larger and they had their own website that we were a division of souls %HESITATION so once we split with that company we no longer had a web page out there yeah lower %HESITATION we did that however we were lucky enough that the company that owns victory tool for multi source for victory told that have a website that they kept the domain name so victory tool dot com was still hours okay in so we quickly once we got the company going %HESITATION every January first to quickly  John R. I. T. guy that we hired to help us with the I. T. stuff put together a quick website so that people that called it just a blank site okay  good I'm okay with that was that %HESITATION some sort of reminder that even if it's going to be doing this interview right now %HESITATION okay so  who is this website for where we designed this for over designing it to %HESITATION  to just have our name available out there so somebody is looking for %HESITATION to own a company and they  they Google tool and die in Minnesota or you know or or if they see a seer acento trade show are %HESITATION here bonus through word of mouth they can quit going take a look and see what we're all about see what our product is so it's essentially for customers of ours and are you thinking it's mostly for new customers or %HESITATION existing customers are both I need you want the website %HESITATION  so let's say you're at a trade show you just want to be able to have something for people to go to to learn about your company yeah exactly primarily it will be for  new customers to learn about us %HESITATION existing copper come customers %HESITATION at least with how it's configured right now won't get anything out of it other than if they want to you know look at a quick %HESITATION email address or something like that it's a class or something like that contact information or address stuff like that but this primarily for new customers so to take a look at our work product examples of our product and that kind of thing okay  so %HESITATION  for this what kind of business goals would you happen this website what would you like it to do my legs I'd like it to impress upon new customers %HESITATION our quality  %HESITATION they like they like it too actually game help us to gain new customers so %HESITATION we do every year we do an annual trade show this in different places across the country and that's where we get most of our generate most of our new business auto so they come a seer both legal are currently sweet their card or whatever and and then when they go back to their go back home no look us up on the on our website  and so we want to impress them and to help Miller them and so it's still a  no really it is to gain %HESITATION gain more customers okay  and %HESITATION  how  is there anyone else that we need to talk to besides you for this project would we need to speak to your business partner or are there other people involved other stakeholders in your company that would want input on what would be in the website yeah I think would be a good idea to to talk about which %HESITATION my business partner and  you know he I'm sure he would like to invest some ideas into it as well okay %HESITATION great so we talked a little bit about who your customers are and who your users would be and %HESITATION who do you think the biggest competitors are right now of yours and what are what worries you about them  our biggest competitors are not necessarily regional because  our product is sold throughout the country and in Canada  %HESITATION sort competitors are primarily yeah manufacturing hop it's like Michigan and Ohio all  %HESITATION Wisconsin %HESITATION I it was so we we want to  %HESITATION  want to be able to actually enter their markets their markets are much richer for our product so we're trying to actually enter those market places yeah and pull from  from what our competitors are already there are competitors have an advantage being close to the customers okay so we need %HESITATION  to have %HESITATION %HESITATION not overcome that was quality increasing so word were targeting markets are already have some pretty serious competition %HESITATION okay  %HESITATION so how do you at X. expect to differentiate what you %HESITATION make are how is your product different than the other what makes you  that are you know why would I come to you as opposed to another %HESITATION too and I can  our product is very high quality %HESITATION the customers that we have that we've had for years many always have for many years come back to us because we've got a very high quality product and we saw for a good price  as I mentioned many of our customers are throughout the country  we've got customers in California could be buying dies from a lot closer to to California but they bind us because they're they're very impressed with our service our our quality so that that's %HESITATION you know so that's that's the main thing we need to solve solar service and quality %HESITATION to work  Somers so it sounds like those are the two biggest things that you want to differentiate from other companies that you have a good quality product and price is reasonable  so %HESITATION using %HESITATION few key words how would you want people to see your brain at besides those those two words and any other things you would use to describe your company  you know I think %HESITATION  %HESITATION key words %HESITATION well quality %HESITATION  you know %HESITATION are %HESITATION %HESITATION lead time as far as how quickly we can %HESITATION get the product %HESITATION to our customer is is usually much better than our competitors are so  %HESITATION so narrowly high quality good service but quick service  and are your %HESITATION I most the competitors are they larger than you did you say or are there well where would you fit into the grand scheme of things %HESITATION in terms of size are you considered a small shop a medium size shop a large size shop I would say that we were worried probably an average size shop there are so much bigger shops and we are in those are some customers are really kind of going after Izzy's larger shops they tend to be more expensive  yeah %HESITATION but %HESITATION but there's there's also other shops are smaller than ours okay  %HESITATION let's see so we know now kind by customers buy products %HESITATION from you over another competitor at the two main things that you mentioned the quality and the the price %HESITATION so when you lose sales what are the most common  reasons  %HESITATION the most current rate Stojko common reasons are %HESITATION  could be  price even though I say there were competitive there's a there's a lot of companies that are always out there looking for something cheaper and you know so  %HESITATION we do compete with China so are %HESITATION so that's where praise comes into play %HESITATION China does provide a lower cost quality %HESITATION lower costs tool but %HESITATION typically the lead time is much longer notes where we can you know even though they might be a little cheaper  it to it's gonna come across the ocean so we could be a lot of the time so  %HESITATION  so yeah so what things to customers complain about our ask for most often and why  the %HESITATION or do they complain we don't play  %HESITATION  you know usually it it could be %HESITATION could be over price you know when we're trying to quote something you could say are yours to Heidi and we know what we work with our customers in the race  %HESITATION used there is very rare to ever have complained small quality that's it's pretty much are our highest answer would thank god  %HESITATION level primarily complaints are are use okay so %HESITATION at the demographics of the people who would be using this website can you tell me a little bit about the potential users who are these %HESITATION buyers are they  %HESITATION general managers of other companies or what are the rules of people who are actually going to be using the website to  Klay speaking it's it's tooling engineer so it's somebody within their company that  is very well very knowledgeable about metal stamping dies they probably work tool and die maker at one time or maybe it's a sign or whatever so you know the product very well  they're the ones that are usually always shopping for for diet builders soul %HESITATION sometimes it'll be %HESITATION %HESITATION purchasing manager or something like that that doesn't have that kind of background but their their job is is trying to find shops and then they'll send the engineers ought to check a so so so could be a variety of people primarily I would say merrily men or women or probably more men than women  the governor and across a woman that and what's what's the typical age group do you think  typical age your but %HESITATION by the way since then and I did have a woman that used to buy dice from us okay  so what typical age group %HESITATION  it could be %HESITATION a lot of our guys that have been in the business for awhile so could be people in their forties or fifties %HESITATION  so but sometimes younger okay  %HESITATION see I think I can't think of any other questions %HESITATION  right now I think this gives me a good idea good background of what what %HESITATION sort of work that you do %HESITATION are there any %HESITATION let's see do you have any other questions about or any other insight you might want to give me about a company or what you might want to slip say to do for you yeah I think that in the future we you know typically are  it's safer to another company is just sort of a show and tell sort of thing  but in the future I think it would be a bad idea to have a P. like an information exchange because often times not office makes sense or not this is an idea but often times were sharing files or customer needs to access the diet is sign  for all we've been done for them see some kind of oral so that our  are are we need to they need a place to send files to for quality also maybe it could be a place for receiving calls what activity  in that kind of thing to where you know right now our requesting information  you know like what I see more information or some sort of a  feedback kind of a thing or any %HESITATION current website does our email addresses on there and once in awhile we get  action from that but  I think it could be expanded at one point more than that and have you gotten much feedback on your website at how are people finding an early signing it from the trade shows that you do or are you telling them about it or  well we haven't had a trade show since we since we bought the company work or we're gonna be doing one in November actually so that that would be kind of when we would hope to have our  website revamp computers for the trade show  so November  because I meant to ask you what what the kind of time line we're looking at %HESITATION  let's see if they have any other questions arm  I think that might be it for now and we can talk later about what sort of ideas and things you might want on the website %HESITATION I want to ask you how long is your company better run  can you give me to name is actually been around for about twenty five years  so %HESITATION the original owners sold it in two thousand five tomatoes or something about it beginning of the year or so to really were we only owned it for about  seven or eight months now once great all right well thanks a lot for a for talking about your project and well thank you talking soon okay %HESITATION alright
