resolution my name's Bobby does show an injured around we're going to sit down with twenty five masters of the design industry and we're gonna learn from them we're gonna learn how the best companies in the world approach communicate and deployed design in their businesses every single day in this episode we're talking with Katie deal Katie is the director of experience design and Aaron be should focus on how to frame user experiences and you storytelling to lead a discussion  we're gonna get to that stick around right after these messages  thanks for the support whether you need a domain a

thanks for having me  what's one thing about designed it's clear to you that you feel is not so clear other people in  it's getting better but I would say %HESITATION some still don't know that design is more than what you see  as Steve Jobs said that %HESITATION it's not just what it looks like that how it works I'm paraphrasing %HESITATION and of course I believe in that but there's a little bit more to them  when we think about design were often think about solving problems %HESITATION design it's simplicity is just being intentional about something trying to solve a problem thinking about the end user hopefully doing so in a maybe a collaborative fashion doing it iterative fashion these are often times the tools of design but you can  use those tools for really solving kind of almost any problem %HESITATION so it might be and what the interface on the app looks like what color is it hands and where the buttons go and how that works but it can also be the strategy or the shape of the org and how people work together and who works with %HESITATION these the types of things that you can use that tool set of design to solve for %HESITATION and I don't know if that's wide enough it's known wide enough %HESITATION unfortunately but we're getting there for sure what is what is that tool set so that's interesting so it sounds like you're saying that there's this thing that we can use call design for things outside of user faces %HESITATION we can solve business problems and we can design teams using this process what what are some of the things that you've used in this process yeah and it was very clear while there are people that have job titles that into designer like myself yeah it doesn't necessarily mean that only designers do this right I could just like will not only plumbers plum right or teachers teach at it design is a method for solving problems %HESITATION as I mentioned it's about bringing intentionality to it and good design I feel includes a humanistic approach try to consider who the end user is and so on word you might be thinking about well who are the people in that organization that are gonna be affected by what the shape of that organization looks like and so you know you bring the tools of research and you get out and you learn from those individuals what they want what they don't want try to understand what might come of these decisions that you might make and then the other part of the tool set is iteration %HESITATION designers %HESITATION great designers utilizing  duration and so that might mean that they make a low fidelity version of their their idea other solution first and test it out so that they again can learn from that and user group to know whether or not it's working %HESITATION basically leaving your assumptions on the table so to speak %HESITATION and trying to find what that right solution might be another tool in that tool set would be collaboration %HESITATION great design I believe works with a collaborative team a multi disciplinary team %HESITATION because you know we don't know every answer and I'm trying to say that design can solve just about any problem well we're not an expert in just about any problem and people using design or not expert and everything so you have to bring people together other experts that you can learn from %HESITATION in order to develop those solutions  it's interesting how do you %HESITATION see what's in it  innovation and collaboration one of the things that I in my in my designer past I found to be really interesting is integration once you get the hang of it once you understand that that's a key component of the design process it becomes so obvious that you need to do it because it I think one of the superpowers designers have is that we can just create stuff from the ether and do it a thousand times really quickly right engineers don't have that leisure %HESITATION  but the the kind of flip side of that coin is when you iterate on something that you do it at low fidelity %HESITATION the business people right like the non designer's the seem to generally not be able to get past the fact that it looks like crap but it needs to look like crap in order in order for it to move forward how like how would you explain the art of iteration and the importance of federation to someone in the business %HESITATION %HESITATION lower risk fast  %HESITATION okay I know it's there I hear you it can be difficult to show somebody something that is in all the way thought through and you know they start poking at you know well that that copy is wrong or you know that that it's too big for the area that's going to be %HESITATION and they might have great points but you're you're trying to direct their conversation props to something else keeping it low fidelity %HESITATION and helping them see the stages of what you're working towards I think one way to solve for that is that you know you show them what I what you can do in terms of the high fidelity version if we'll get to this Polish screen that has all the right bells and whistles but in order to get their first let's make sure we have the idea right %HESITATION let's make sure we have the interaction model right %HESITATION or we're talking about it or click let's make sure that you know before we go and move desks around %HESITATION you know when we're gonna put new signage up and everything but before we do that like let's try to you know scenario plan here what is gonna look like we have people over here a couple of their %HESITATION in think through some listeners Michael who's gonna come of what meeting right like you give yourself examples of that and but I think yeah that they need to be able to know that you you will get to the end and finalize that  speaking about organizational design you've been here for a few years and Airbnb since then the design side is like re shuffle bit right %HESITATION terms lay out structure how however you guys work together %HESITATION and that's a that's a good school to have that sense of adaptability %HESITATION but how is a remax approach this yeah I mean we're definitely gonna company within hyper growth and so you know I started here almost three years ago and it was about ten people in the experience design team and now it's %HESITATION close to eighty S. %HESITATION it's from  of all %HESITATION how so much has changed but so much has maintained through that %HESITATION a lot of the good things and and some of the challenges of course to %HESITATION but I guess how we've approached it is that one starting from what do we want to stay the same and knowing that we're going to grow and in our mission is to help anyone belong anywhere and you know we can't do that unless we scale our mission requires that kind of global scale as but if we're going to do that we're gonna expand our team here and abroad and %HESITATION make sure that we're expanding our product %HESITATION we need to figure out what are the things that are principles or values that you just can't change and I think we're pretty lucky that our founders got that from the get go and they prior to its culture a culture it's been a really big thing for Airbnb and I think that's one of the reasons why we've been successful %HESITATION because we've worked really hard to make sure that everybody that works here is passionate about the mission is you know excited to embrace the adventure of building a business and you know uncertainty and challenge that comes ahead of us and that people are really you know strong in their skills and that I think has helped to make sure that you no matter what we do in a matter where you are in the world you know you're working on some side somebody that you don't mind and banging your head against the wall through late at night trying to figure out a heart problem like you trust the people that we work with that and that's been a big deal  so %HESITATION when I first joined %HESITATION as images super small team at the time of what was the right size the time at ten people time at it basically was kind of a design project right is that right about it in a bill this team %HESITATION I got under  chance of where we're at today we're going to get to so just like great design utilizing research and so I did one on one interviews with people on the team in a one on one interviews with our partners I product and and just try to understand what was working what wasn't working %HESITATION with them in the designers %HESITATION of course you know look at the work in India where the process was and how things were going there basically just did a you know an assessment just like you would in any other design project %HESITATION and then started to kind of shape what the opportunities were like where the problem areas and how might we do these differently and again just like great design be collaborative with it so it's not like we're just gonna in a redesigned the design team without you in colluding the designers and the product managers and the engineers and so we did a lot of workshops and we talked about you know the types of things that we could do to improve it one of the problems we had at the time is there wasn't a real sense of togetherness in the nineteen %HESITATION and that's because there were ten designers and probably around eleven product teams being that you know if the product teams were focused on different areas of the product right and these designers retention working on islands by themselves in with engineers and product managers but not other designers and they were sitting in all sorts of different places until we identified that is a opportunity area %HESITATION the other place that we saw some challenge where %HESITATION the designers were feeling like they were only utilize basically at the end of the design process unit make things look pretty  and staying AT and they fell under utilized the product managers engineers and understand why in the designers and seen that engaged and so there is this is like you know kind of dueling challenge there where and not nobody was happy %HESITATION it just was working as well so it is it sounds like the  isn't that in designer intensely left out of the decision making process is that there is a %HESITATION mis education or lack of education around how designers actually should work into a process yeah I mean yeah I there's only so much I can assume as to like how it got there you know but I think it's everybody's at fault right how it got there radius is that you know where the designers actually holding up their end of the bargain right you know where the designer showing that they should be at the table at the earlier stages right where the product managers engineers being inclusive but I mean there's any number of reasons why it might have been that way maybe designers and actually walked away from that or maybe %HESITATION they once were at the table if you work out I I don't know as much as to what happened before I got here %HESITATION we certainly try to understand why things were the way they work %HESITATION but really you know wanted to shift our thinking and how could it be better and a lot of that was about shifting the mindset of the folks that are currently in the building and also part of that was hiring %HESITATION and so if you looked at the team and thought okay will have the skills we people are really good visual where real people are really good interactions time but we're missing some facilitators were missing the people that you know can come into the room and grabbed the white Ford marker and activate a whole room and that's in one of the places where your designs upfront value really starts to come out rain is that like before there's even an idea they're already providing value in terms of like how the thing is working have a conversation is working and so we started hiring for people like that some people that we know we're going to round up the skill sets the team into only built into the team %HESITATION in these different individuals people at different in kind of since levels of seniority people with a different mix of skills I had it was starting to become  revealing two engineers type mentors as well as the designers how design can be better leverage it was inspiring for them to see how design could be a part of earlier stages in the process like planning and strategy conversations and just general facilitation of so things are to shift and we continue to build up the team another areas I mentioned that we had folks on islands right so building up the team so that you know we always had at least designers impairs working on things together %HESITATION we and our design team here we call basically all of the the folks are focused on the design of the product the wine and the U. acts the experiences honors %HESITATION and that's because there's more than you know the pixels the resigning as the experience %HESITATION but everybody does a little bit of both you wind you acts but of course there's like different levels right you know that the and there's not a so everyone is eleven eleven am to ten on all fronts %HESITATION and so on our teams when you know you have a pair you you think about like will this person's really visually strong and this person's little bit much strong interaction so pair them together so that they can help each other %HESITATION and learn from each other and those that still exist the concept yeah %HESITATION our teams %HESITATION now have you know we're we're even pass just having a pair which is great %HESITATION and so yes we have a few more does that mean %HESITATION but yeah we we do we work very hard to the the managers and I and where you know people are gonna go and how we balance out skill sets %HESITATION you know it might just be because I like to drink so much but I kind of think about is like building a good cocktail think about a team of psychiatrists and it's all like all the ingredients on the vodka  have anything like too strong overpowering  I have a balance out interest rate and it's not just like visual interaction thank you also to think about like they're soft skills like you know some folks are a little bit you know better at the you know the conversational part or the presentational part %HESITATION presentation part odd there's some folks that are a bit more introvert and some have been more extroverted than anything goes as long as you're thinking about the composition and how it comes together there's a great study and I'm not gonna remember the person's name but it's a ten talk but I'll take up later and show you %HESITATION but this woman did a study about chickens and laying eggs and she basically put all of the like the best chickens together and thought like well let's see if they make you know the most eggs next to this other group that we're not gonna sort amount just do a mix of chickens and lo and behold the like super group of chickens did not do better they basically fought the whole time and like you're on talk to each other Alfa chickens yes that  a heterogeneous group like nice mix of all like skill sets %HESITATION return chickens here check the goods but they ended up doing better and it's a perfect analogy for a team in terms of like you know making sure you have that right mix you don't want just like he team and to know that the final bill it's also a good %HESITATION plus one filling inclusivity things yeah the couple couple roles that you mention on your experiencing said you I. N. U. acts make up the experience team and I'm very curious now because  the Airbnb experience of course is bigger than digital you guys have the physical world experience as well do you have the do you guys think of experience as a system or do you think of it in the world of physical experience and digital experiencing concussion so  we do think of it as a system that includes digital and physical as the experience design team does include folks are folks and you I knew acts and also includes the folks that are full and focus on illustration and animation people that are more service design minded %HESITATION but generally folks are a mixture of these types of things and it's that make sure that comes together at the I guess the thing that isn't necessarily perfectly captured in the job title is that when we are looking for these individuals we're not just looking for somebody who's going to have a portfolio of nothing but pixels and can only speak about the pixels right we're looking for the people that are gonna be able to talk about how those pixels have ramifications in the real world %HESITATION and can consider those ramifications which you know is really something that you know kind of transcends time and place I mean it can be very challenging things %HESITATION but that's the crux of whatever it is and the pixels which of course you know our our tools to instigate this experience %HESITATION they're only in a very small part of an experience someone has an error being bi most of it probably ninety nine percent of it is them in the off line world interacting with strangers people that probably speak a different language on another side of the planet and so it's imperative that we're thinking about those things when we're looking at a pixel %HESITATION and so something as simple as you know the words that we choose the size the button or the inability to get to the button is going to be impacted by the fact that you know somebody might be on the phone carrying their suitcase get into a locked apartment and it's late at night %HESITATION and so considering those things is imperative %HESITATION how we do so it's actually your story %HESITATION we have John  story board up on the wall that it was it was on the wall for all to see that we actually use it things like this in our design process every day %HESITATION and thinking about in terms of pictures and in terms of the stories like a comic strip of what is the experience that someone's going through what is the context of their use %HESITATION and that really does help remind us that it's more than just what we see on you know our screens there and and that's you know one of the many things that we need to do of course researching getting out there ourselves using the product ourselves or other ways to remind us but %HESITATION yeah it is a lot more than the screen that's really interesting  how do you define a design centric company  %HESITATION design center company is one that  probably doesn't leave well enough alone %HESITATION and it know that by thinking of people the end users first %HESITATION  in wants and needs change and evolve and to stay ahead of it by you know looking for opportunity and  iterating ends trying new things and exploring with a %HESITATION want to make it better  I think that's the design center in the do you think Airbnb is that yes %HESITATION definitely %HESITATION we're we're lucky that we have %HESITATION design at the the heart of this company right now two of our founders is okay CIOS is we have three designers the executive team line that that is definitely a wonderful thing and you know I'd say an advantage to having design is part of the company from the get go there %HESITATION and that's  kind of permeated within our culture and as a pet mention that culture is so important what's not like we're hiring for designers no matter what across the entire board and then what disciplinarian but certainly thinking about you the end user is a part of it at one of our core values as being a host and that is a very design like thing greatest like thinking about you know what who's going to use this how they're gonna interact with it and that should be a part of everything day thinking and and I think we also have a rather ambitious culture %HESITATION where you know we do want to make a big impact in this world in our mission is to have anyone belong anywhere and that is a big meaty mission right at anyone anywhere right and that's basically shifting the the mindset of a whole lot of this planet %HESITATION but we're here because we do believe that we can go after that but %HESITATION we're gonna have to you know take on a lot of heavy and hard work to get there and then I think that's

understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One Airbnb and that looks let me tell you three reasons why I use it one poor communication is one of the biggest blockers for talented teams to when you don't get feedback from others early and often you can get lost in the woods and that's just bad for everyone and three without a prototype it can be hard to show others your full vision for design invision solves all of that you can rapidly prototype at the front end of the design process and collaborate across every stage of the project it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers and developers and writers teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when they use and vision sweet a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision after com and use our access code I. N. B. E. dash high resolution for three months free  so if you years ago every be put out of a brand %HESITATION and it's I mean it's beautiful and we just walked by the low ourselves coming into this room %HESITATION by anytime you're launching something that big especially when it's a brand when you could not Freeview it to the majority of the world %HESITATION there could be a lot of fear of whether it's gonna be well received it's gonna fail right %HESITATION now it did not still life is still  there %HESITATION but walk us through that that experience of actually designing nothing in preparing a team for such a big launch and for whatever section you guys may receive some great question it's certainly  the biggest project I've ever worked on rebranding a company that you know at that time was in a pretty large I think we're probably about fifteen hundred two thousand people worldwide %HESITATION people knew about our product all around the world and here we are about to change the face of it %HESITATION so yeah it was yeah it's scary it's exciting %HESITATION but it wasn't anything done overnight it wasn't anything done in a vacuum and and I think that helped give us the confidence that it was the right thing to do we're going in the right direction we went through a very long design process %HESITATION in terms of creating the logo and typography which did happen before I was here %HESITATION it was I think close to six months of iteration and our host community %HESITATION for one as well as some guests were a part of that process %HESITATION and we did get feedback from folks along the way ends when we applied it to the product and sorry bringing the color system the typography system and really just the kind of the essence of the new brands to the product that is well %HESITATION was probably even more challenging because we're about to move things around on people that I've been using our product for many years and we did that again with you know included parts of our community obviously we couldn't share it with the world yet but we wanted to understand that it wasn't just what we thought was right but that others could identify with it  our product is all about a community in so course it couldn't be done completely in isolation but I do think the learning here is that you know when you're launching something and if it helps if you can do your best to your room  move the restaurant of the surprise %HESITATION and it's you know try to integrate you know as we talked about earlier with you know a kind of maybe a lower fidelity version or a partial version and try to test aspects of your hypothesis so that when you are launching something that you put all this blood sweat and tears in %HESITATION the reactions shouldn't be surprising at scale you know you never know what happens of course you have to be ready for that and you know you know you have to know you tried your best and that you can always change you can always enter eight especially in the digital world we're very lucky that we can you know fine tune as time goes in and absorb feedback %HESITATION but yeah I think it can be hard for a designer to you know kind of put their heart and soul out there through their work and don't feel at risk of well what if people hate it %HESITATION but you know if you don't try anything you'll you'll never get to a better solution and you know that risk that you take can be minimized %HESITATION through going through a process of you know including others and %HESITATION trying it yourself and prototyping and experimenting with whatever you can %HESITATION so that by the time you get there you'll know with confidence that it's the right direction this is inform decisiveness you've but now it's it's not you can stick your finger in the air and hope that you do the right thing you guys put in all the work up front to make sure that your core community loved it and that when you guys actually went to market it wasn't about capitulating to the masses it was about believing in the decision process %HESITATION and the design process and of course now two years later what an amazing branded else right what an amazing mark and it's everywhere and it's friendly and it's beautiful I think it's a look that as one of the great rebrands %HESITATION so congratulations  so earlier you mentioned that Airbnb uses storyboards to document like to use our journey that you're gonna be designing for right but outside of that what are other ways that a baby involves storytelling in its design process  Sir doing is going to one of those examples of using a maybe a lower fidelity way of getting to what that and solution should be %HESITATION so you can you know kind of dean Brian and demonstrated direction and get people excited and also prototype it to understand whether or not it's the right thing as the story telling can be really at any stage of the product development process the problem solving process I have it's a powerful one because it's something that every individual can kind of identify with and so if we can tell the story of what a person %HESITATION is going to go through and we help people kind of start to understand a little bit about that person and see what challenges they might have and how this might be better for them they can start to see themselves within that you know they start to imagine you know people they know and experiences they have had %HESITATION and it really helps to kind of like **** the heart strings and you know get that understanding of what it could be and somewhere that might come in let's say that we have you know a new idea for a new product and we could talk about the list of features of this new products like you're gonna be like one click to such and such actually live with even say like in a conversion is going to go up with such and such and you get a bunch of people in a room back that sounds great version yeah well you know whatever whatever that is version dollars the  and everyone's probably imagining something different than what that's going to be and everyone's probably thinking of what they already know of %HESITATION and just thinking of us you know it's like very on top of that but let's say in  senator designer who or anyone on the team who's got another idea %HESITATION for a new feature that's going to be something that no one's ever seen before and you want them to understand that you told the story maybe you you help them understand what the current predicament is all right well we have you know a family of five they want to go away to remind the weekend the mom spends three hours and Airbnb trying to find the right place she needs in a wheel chair for %HESITATION because she's in a wheelchair or that you know she's got young kids and they have a pet and they're going through all of these trials and tribulations to find the right place now let's imagine that with this new feature that we already know what her needs are because we've seen that from her previous booking she comes in and out right front and center are the places that we know would be the right fit for her and you can show this through mixtures and we can highlight that with the things that this place will have based on her needs and you can talk about how this experience is going to be better for her and really like to help them understand like her name is and and she lives and you know Newark New Jersey and you cultivate this kind of understanding of context that now you know the people in the room are all of a sudden like getting these really kind of like visceral images in their mind about and from Newark and it trials and tribulations of her booking experience and they're trying to understand a little bit about that product idea that you had instead of a list of features you've told in the story of what that thing might look like and behave like you can break it down to features later you can you know scope up engineering work later %HESITATION but first you know just like any other human would try to understand it in terms of you know what the person is going through on that's what people can really identify with  and so it helps to sell a story and it helps frame the story and it helps so the work framework and helps you actually even execute on it because you can be reminded of those stages that and needs to go through so that you don't leave anything out when you're actually building one of our talk about just dove tailing into storytelling per second %HESITATION  I think one of the most interesting exciting things Airbnb is launched recently strips  super cool  can you think back to maybe look of one of the first conversations you had with Brian or really any anyone on your team or in one of the business %HESITATION where you told a story %HESITATION that validated that trips might be a thing that's interesting to explore the can you can you think back to a time where that certainly was a very big part of understanding what trip should be no everybody's been experimenting with things like trips for a long time and as I mentioned that story board is really powerful tool in thinking about trips because when we put it together and this was before I got here that the storyboard first came together it has I think like fifteen frames or something like this and so it's got gas frames like a comic strip and got host frames and when you do that and you look at it you think about where is the Airbnb product a part of this journey you know where is it helping and where is it not you realize that there is probably only in about you know five of the frames there's a quite a bit of it the on off line travel experience where you know you're not using Airbnb product that much %HESITATION it's you know it's the host it's the place that you're traveling it's what you quit yourself with and you know your friends and etcetera that are actually in providing that  service the experience not Airbnb and it was very revealing to us at that moment is that like you know there's more here there's more we could be doing to help people feel a sense of belonging when they're traveling and so that was one we're just story kind of like a night in this want for us to do more saying %HESITATION and then trying to you know go to down the path that you're talking about is like well how did it help us actually find the right thing to do and and get everybody excited about that direction I had actually there were a series of stories done one where we're looking at what might be you know a tourist experience today like than the opposite of what we are going for and so we films people that we're having this experience and finding ways that you know it wasn't that great in %HESITATION finding those moments where you know an individual was you know getting lost in %HESITATION was area called the tourist spot Fishman's wife of his words and you know the big boss over the goal yeah range and and seeing the things that most tourists to add and then we did another video where you know we gave the best experience the best trip that we could and try to see what that opposite look like ma'am or what that difference look like and found that it was absolutely there is a there there there's a much better trip to be had %HESITATION where we were considering the individual and considering you know what a local might do %HESITATION versus just for the Taurus might do that second when your mom comes to visit you know where you taker those the questions we should be asking not like you know where you know the Taurus are going and think about what the little gems that you know in the San Francisco that you know that's what you know we want people to see if we want to give them a sense of belonging and  how many of these stories do you have to tell before you start finding repeatable patterns because I can't imagine it's just the first one right because that's kind of one data point I think the number of stories you tell is dependent on how many scenarios you're trying to bring to light it's actually remarkable that I don't think you need to get you know a hundred different people telling their story in order to get you know that the quantity behind it's actually you know you need you know just usually just a few stories to kind of and plant the seed in people's mind and let them you know remember like Bobby and Jimmy and and and Serra and you know all these individuals just give them one or two unknown latch on to the stories you can back up that sentiment through data in other ways right so like let's start with a story and then you know we can run a survey or you do online analytics to understand like for me it was there that a lot of people that might feel that way but the thing that really takes root in people's minds the images of a check written there might actually don't want too many too many stories and they just kinda they all sort of blend together and they forget  how can a designer who's working at a company who's never done this process before trying to apply because I I can only imagine that there's someone watching this right now is like well this is I'm throwing out mice back and throwing out all the business goals might not the best idea and trying to reframe it as a story to go present to like stakeholders on Monday ran %HESITATION but that's probably not enough context right so what are the things that they should be looking for it actually present at that meeting in that's a great question I think it's the and you guys are with the people problem and that's the point of the story is just like help them understand as a people problem of understanding that that you know there are people that have this and where you your idea will take root in that world and  context the business case yeah the yeah quantifiable or that they of quantum data that you have behind it is actually useful in its supportive it shouldn't be the lead right when you're in a setting up your paycheck and you really want to kind of ignite %HESITATION want to participate in this into you know throw money and invest in your start up no hope people understand that this is something that real people are going to deal with and and let them understand it in you know basic terms  something that they might use  Katie this last segment we reached out to our community and we asked them to help us or some questions %HESITATION we have five questions that are burning for the communities that we're gonna get into these next all right %HESITATION the first one is how do you explain the role of design the people in your business  in my bed in a minor B. and B. inn Airbnb how do you explain the role of design the people at Airbnb well it's funny you ask because I have to put together a presentation for many this week we have a a big company event with his top of mind yeah okay all employees are coming over and they want to know what experiences line is %HESITATION I talking to solving problems %HESITATION just like we started here you know it's not just what something looks like but it's how it works and I have I oftentimes Intel story by giving them an example of where design isn't or where something was poorly designed %HESITATION because that's usually the most revealing place were like oh yes that that could be better right and it's it's very you know like when good designs there you don't even know right so if you got a sometime show that off the set and but I I I I like people to understand that your design is by no mean  in something that you know only this one team can own %HESITATION and that's one of the reasons why in the story board is on the wall for all the scene is one of the reasons why we try to be a very collaborative team is so you know we can all be problem solvers %HESITATION you know we are often the ones that are in the most skilled at leveraging tools that help was quickly visualize %HESITATION were also the ones that are you constantly exercising that muscle of problem solving in integration and experimentation of but it certainly doesn't mean that something that we're going to go into an island %HESITATION so I I hope to encourage %HESITATION inform people that design is very much a problem solving process and and very much when that we want them to participate in house of design or get Airbnb curly or currently structured need design organs for parts it's experience design design operations research and content strategy in these four parts work really closely together %HESITATION you know we have team meetings together we sit together we work on everything basically start to finish but that's with in the larger product or which is also a multi disciplinary collaborative and so we also set alongside product managers engineers and data scientists and the way that our design team works in terms of in these four parts is that we are basically %HESITATION integrated distributed among the product teams and we have %HESITATION various teams like market place or growth and within those teams will have product managers engineers designers do scientists researchers countercharges except for all working together on that problem and so that they can be you know hyper focused on that problem in the goals that they have become experts in that area %HESITATION but then when you think  but it kind of like laterally we as a design team in it interact and share a lot learnings across because if we just look only at growth we might lose you know some moments in between between the user's journey and so that connection between designers on different teams is really important %HESITATION and so that's why we we focus also in bringing the design team together as one entity  so their businesses out there with one or two designers hardly a design to  when your the only designer in a company how do you convince the company of the value of design well they they got you if you're the only one so if they know something  it is a good question before it was an error being be I worked at a company called green start and we were essentially an accelerator at first then we were a venture capital firm essentially but what was different about us is that we invested in start ups with designing seemed equity in return and these were early stage startups like really small team sometimes five people you know they might have a an engineer to marketing person CEO and if I thought they were there was a great sign the thing understood designed to some extent %HESITATION but yeah you know of course a lot of times when they bring in one designer that they're looking for that you know make it look pretty type of thing %HESITATION and I think one thing that a designer you know it needs to do in order scale of cells and to really have impact is to you know help that team seem more than that see more than just the in pixels but also the process to get there and include them in that %HESITATION help them understand the value of user research getting out there and talking to people %HESITATION it's remarkable how  many companies don't do that %HESITATION get out there and and start story boarding the journey and what are people going through and think about you know what is it working when is it not %HESITATION before I joined here I almost want to just leave my company and create a story map because it was such a need for start ups to actually think about their journey because a lot of them aren't and if you think about your journey put as maybe a storyboard or a diagram and then you map it like we called happiness Kerr if you draw a line of like when is it going well and when is it bad yeah super revealing right is so you know where those issues might be %HESITATION and get that whole team around that idea %HESITATION they can start to understand a little bit more and hopefully we'll see your value but more importantly hopefully they'll they'll start in you know in bad those sentiments of design it and that tool kit that we talked about originally in order to make the company better  so at large how should designers actually the fine %HESITATION measure and then present designs all from their projects in  I don't know if we've ever talked about it as just design results %HESITATION probably because we're so kind of hyper focused on being really collaborative team because we think that's where the the best results come from is it through this team is kind of balancing and and leveraging these different disciplines at but design actually works really close with the data scientists team and of course these research team we knew at the start of a of a design project or a a product development project %HESITATION we're gonna look at and where are we now you know what it what are the challenges today and you know then we start to you know piece together solutions were including data science in that process  and in a lot of times and they're bringing great ideas to the table %HESITATION in terms the end solution based on you know some of the things that they're seeing and soon different trends that have been happening over time but also there helping us kind of shape how we might ship it irate so engineering data science are really major part of how we're going to go and launch something %HESITATION it's very rare that we launch something that's just like a wholly new overhaul of a product all at once the reason why is because it's very difficult to learn from is often times what we're doing is taking that you know kind of end result that dream scenario the envision that we've created and breaking it into smaller pieces that we can ship learn from it %HESITATION it on and then build on and build on and so you know by the end of you know a year or four months we've completely overhauled the work but it's been a step came to that and design tells help us do that and so when we're looking at each individual step in seeing how it's working %HESITATION those are the moments were assessing whether or not you know it was a success and yeah I don't know if we ever think about it in terms of like with the design of success it's like wolf was a product success and and there's a lot to it more than just the design of course  I think we can finish with this question %HESITATION is the purpose of design starts to evolve and continues to evolve as it has been for the last decade  what are some roles and methodologies that will continue to emerge over the next five years  what's so exciting I I mean I I don't know but I certainly am seeing a greater and greater need for designers to think outside the pixels  which is ironic because everything is becoming more and more digital and of course and we're getting into virtual reality and and things are becoming three dimensional %HESITATION but all the more reason that we have to think in a Beyonce those screens in those goggles and various devices as you know machines are coming in there absolutely enormous scenes are coming here and you know they are they are replacing a lot of the things that humans do every day %HESITATION but that only you know unlocks more opportunity for humans to spend their time in their brain space and one other things circle happiness %HESITATION for it like one example is in design tools are getting ever more robust and capable and there that they're starting to bring design and engineering closer together and so that we can you know create an prototyping and building make all at the same time which is really exciting %HESITATION but because of that you know then we you know I have moments in our day that we can think about other things right hopefully it helps us make those things faster and so we can think about you know the challenges of into two individuals they don't speak the same language on the other side of the planet coming together putting side there bias sees and you know they're in a  inability to understand each other's %HESITATION you know first starting point to actually break down those barriers those are the things that designers could be spending their time so we can be spending our time thinking about you know government organization of policy %HESITATION companies to be thinking about more inwardly how they might design their company is it supposed to enter just following suit with what was there before %HESITATION so I'm excited I don't know what the titles will be %HESITATION those are always have that little fall I I still don't know the time yeah  I think we make it up on a day to day basis  yes yeah but I think we have our work cut out for us and I think we definitely just need you know it was those interviews come first so full circle %HESITATION design is more than what it looks like and then we need to really think about how things work and think about how we can apply that to things that you know are already being designed to %HESITATION but things that you are in desperate need of new ways of thinking and not leave them on the floor  well well thank you
