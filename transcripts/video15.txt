usability testing is all about light for me exposing the problems and exposing what works really well for use as an understanding why research is already like I said that just different tools like this and if I have a better than a screwdriver depend thing you're trying to find out  so one thing again ostalo about is people like the idea of research they know it's simple and it's like flossing everyone of you should do it but then at the house and how does someone start getting into doing research like if they know next nothing about it if you're thinking about you'll put that actual sort of developing it at that stage of recent than it's just great to get people using it for the task that you're planning at full so even if that friends family even if that people in the office it's just great to get your and product exposed to people like that say that you can watch what happens and in usability testing we really looking for the problems for people fall into and out what works well for them why it works well for them and so having anybody go through your products and you will see those things as faint as they went through every time you'd want to you know start testing the border range of uses am and get out of this kind of biases that come in with friends and family but to start off and gain confidence and start small it's great case to stop so we talk about usability testing is there anything on the policies am isn't big specific that you're supposed to look for so you've you've designed to wrap you given at your friends or family is there any like %HESITATION was a golden rules of things to look out for %HESITATION is not really what kind of yeah well what do you make sure you do it  it's kind of set up the tasks that you want to be watching for %HESITATION so basically you have people pay for the tasks and may speak out loud as they do it often depending on what you're testing phone and so you'll be identifying you'll sort of most critical use Ajani's usually and have them walk through that and often that something like some language you use we collect content in I am though but you got on the button %HESITATION when your physician something that just doesn't make sense for most of the people that totally makes sense to you in your design work %HESITATION you'll on development went that it doesn't work for the people and say you're looking for baton you've got them speaking out loud so you can really understand kind of wind that coming out things and send ways and that's the value of usability testing you know as opposed to looking at data from logs or something you really understanding the why of why they they get into certain situations where they called me for what Ole Ole sudden flows went really really well I mean is there like a scared of research so like what usability testing feels like it's like the mid point of the product line second ed but is there like a before and after because I know %HESITATION there's also the debates of %HESITATION you as a user groups you have when you're asking questions also face I mean is how would you say is like the cycle of doing research was the first thing you wrecked would you recommend before even building thing or maybe when you call IT stages yes I've right at the beginning we tend to do what we call foundational resets that's when we really understanding that the main we might use also you in a second baby sat sh and see what else other people have done %HESITATION but we might also do foundational we set  often involves more sort of failed recess techniques going out to when people %HESITATION doing the activity that you're interested in supporting in your product %HESITATION so failed visits doing observational wanna I'm contextual inquiry is a particular technique where you with the past and throughout the day and asking kind of questions as you go along to really understand why they didn't send things in their environment so that's the whole night foundational reset stage at some point you might want to understand sort of bored representations of data %HESITATION you might do %HESITATION seven wet I always recommend doing some sort of qualitative went to begin with %HESITATION whether that's you know your contention in Crimea interviews %HESITATION so especially if a survey said that you've got the range of results that you would want to ask for a particular set of a question if you come back can you pass this kind of clothes and a question with different %HESITATION question I'm says and next to it but you've missed a couple of really significant things out then yo yo this does real problems if you sat by so doing that qualitative went to begin with is really really helpful and then %HESITATION you if I had to I think you were meeting probably focus great yeah sometimes get a bad rap here and so focus groups on use that much in use a reset %HESITATION occasionally I've used them and it's really been more for my benefit of finding out at the main kind of haven't used them for Rick arrest in a representative data but am conducting a focus group helps me understand like these all the point important topics that most of the people with an estimate  yeah and then I can go forward and do my at the technique says more about posting your own knowledge rather than finding information out about that's how I've used them then you have like this kind of always versus mentality intact but I mean do you think there is a better way of research with quality of a constant %HESITATION are these is that like a pointless thing to be asking is really about using those to just get a better understanding of the problem front so size one better than the ever in your opinion or is that it doesn't really work like that that's a very complimentary and you need both so %HESITATION when it comes to the stage of doing usability testing often times we might when we really into sort of initial use of the product to we've gone out that to to beta test as %HESITATION %HESITATION where we've already launched and we doing studies then then you can collect blokes data oak St there is light really very very useful you can see where people are dropping off on a page for example a wide and %HESITATION converting for example and you can't necessarily with understand why and so pondering that with usability testing is a really valuable and say that we can really understand the why and I'm not you know all all quantitative data has in a huge number is it a %HESITATION Dodge number this large as we can get on the day two is as representative as we can get we really are very concerned about that in usability testing it's not so much of a requirements to make sure that your participants are truly representative of the population because you'll looking for pain points and you were trying to understand the why it is that people have these problems said that you understand them  enter modeling you avoidable at designing in that way again yeah I know one criticism of usability testing such like we say sometime this week sports between five and eight people is that enough like to really  solve the problems your your terms of or is it not user base testings already like that's what but it's not comparing it to %HESITATION say I service what you're doing a hundred people is with us about six points that's exactly right so am in seven days you have to be really show that you're getting as good and as a sample as you can as as representative of a kind of the population that's of interest to you and that's a bad idea sampling techniques to do that correctly otherwise it's going to be problems with your sensei as we've often seen in voting and polling kind of thing %HESITATION with usability testing with doing something else quite a quite different made a wet using usability testing to understand what problems people have with the design as they go through as they try and complete that task %HESITATION and so what happens is often you see you start saying the same problems again and again and you really land that you know all this is kind of a problem for everyone in fact the can be problems that you see right at the beginning of running a studies say after we even one or two people annual night yes of course you know I should have seen of course people think of it and not when of course and dropping off at this point and you don't need many many people to prove that and and so you tend to find after five oh eight then you've seen the majority of the problems if you you've probably seen eighty percent of the problems if you carry on testing you will see more problems over time but  you'll have caught all the main ones in the fast five to eight and it will be definitely diminishing returns on that same design a product and is there a point while pivot in the research said Lysaght we've done to test on the app or website these really obvious problems the wise obese whatever comes up do you stop and say right we can adjust the why and that that the design thing I carry on testing again Ole does that muddy the waters I mean is it okay to do that yet now is totally okay to do that and that's actually a form of testing gold light usability testing and and then we schedule two or three people to come in and then we have a break and like half a day or a day with the team get together and talk about what they've seen and how they can adjust tent and then you get to to the more people come in and do the same again and and it's a right on it and it's it's a great idea ready because you don't really want to will need to see kind of five state she's as old and you know fall into the same problem if you won't agree as a team that that problem exists the needs fixing there were other problems when you know you're not shoals somebody somebody you know goes one way and somebody else goes another and it's really you that might be a few different mental models out that when you kind of have to see how it goes over time to see what what the main issues are and what your teen fails need fixing that sent me %HESITATION that's another good reason to do it as well that that was obvious ones that you really want to fix might be sort of hiding other problems that wouldn't be exposed if you didn't fix those ones during the course of the fact that the other thing I am remember you you did the research particle the twenty five principles of web design wasn't as the go  principal web web fascinated weapon and we did that happen we hunted holes that me down speaking he's like this almost like but my mind was plan when you talk about you do a pre study before the study to test the CEO of the studies actually get when that comes out of course you do and could you explain a bit about like what time is it called a pre study a pilot study right confined it steady and safer usability testing me am yeah exactly like state with testing the test we want to make sure that I am the different tasks that we ask people a sort of lining up top plan makes sense for them %HESITATION we want to make sure that those plays wept as we think we should at the time and and the product am is absolutely crucial today pilot testing beforehand yeah you can do that with own techniques %HESITATION vis a vis such that there are many techniques that we have and also talked about a dive you study is a something that sometimes done we can test the questions that we're asking people in the diet study even seven days it's important to test your survey instrument out fast and we often do what we call cognitive pre testing which will sit down with someone and go through the questions to make sure all the questions mean to them what we think by me yeah I'm so just even going back to the beginning so you want to test you've done some test of your family what's the next thing I mean is there do you really at that point need to get a good researcher to help you plan these things or is this something that small teams and stops in do now like professional to test that yeah I'm well does absolutely you can do it Google ventures put some some good and guides for doing usability testing and different sorts of user research testing so that's a good place to look for how to do this from a start up perspective and  you know as a user reset so I personally don't think companies that hire you to reset to the early enough in order to get that kind of foundational research done a million to fund the space really need to be thinking about doing that high up earlier than me doing it now what tends to happen in companies if that people hire eventually they realize that the county design without designer that how it is I know and then the design is as white it's hard for me to do design without the research findings and to really understand the context I'm working and said that's the kind of like it tends to happen and it would be nice from my perspective if it went the other way around that's not to say that you know people shouldn't be doing user testing them sounds obviously you can get better is not the case advocated that you should work with family and friends it's just a good way to get started and you will find issues with your product but %HESITATION it's better to try although you're not aiming for in five to eight people a representative sample of the population you do want to trying to get the same sort of people that you that are at you you I need to put it full so you if you'll be creating at a music capped fourteen ages than it be great to test on teenagers that that %HESITATION that sort of talk it uses for your product is is also important to test for demographic as well like in terms of the way users will behave in India be very different way they behave in America right right and then I went to a different sort of constraints and different different context and different conditions with you know the kinds of friends that use %HESITATION different and can activity they have all those kind of cultural things which basically have a response to you are you have  and how is that is it just basically you need to get on the field I mean I  one thing people do is they tested much in front of the computer when they're that amazing mac Burkle at amazing wifi connection but that how do you really empathize clinic research is more about improvising the passage on a design for right right absolutely and so I think you know we need to take account of the technological constraints that we just talked about you know making sure that when it when I mean for those kind of markets that we potentially and they're in India we have a lot better can activity nowadays but in certain parts of the well there's a lot of the web that still on TV connections taking those kind of considerations into account is important but also you're right that the the cultural and different contextual factors can be really important so what if you're testing for %HESITATION uses preferences of a two designs if you court two separate things how do you know your testing for the right things or the person's opinion what they %HESITATION preferences they have yeah that's a tricky one I think that you know I'm not greatly in favor of testing using usability testing for preferences because it's such a small sample potentially the sample might be biased if you asked with eight different people you might come up with different preferences especially if you would just adding up the numbers a million are in favor of that because it has these problems you know usability testing isn't ready for that purpose so I'm not and against asking about preferences in order to understand why people have those preferences I think that can be really useful in usability  so understanding you know that they need particular things say and maps when then navigating any particular nomarchs yeah that's really really interesting but you know just like trying to cut more numbers about they put  thirty nine a month and then just one day they preferred plates read to mean is that how people lie right when you Austin questions they might tell you what you they think you want to not absolutely so this is why I'm much more into like understanding them completing a task and understanding like what what for them and what doesn't might find them about completing that task it's really what about getting that deep understanding in usability studies so yet don't add up the numbers for preferences light but use that and to understand why that particular design is perfect and for another one %HESITATION and what we can do for future designs to make it more useful for people and spread out from the context from within the personal opinion of yes well  yeah that's right and understanding why that context it leads to that view  I try as much as possible to avoid black magic and like whenever I'm reviewing any code that any of the designers on my team are writing we like trying to avoid anything that maybe it's a little hacking it makes it slightly more performant but the truth is like if we want to have all the material design system we need to be able to build on top of the code and each layer of that could matters
