my name is Tom Roberts the VP of interactive and design at  I'm responsible for product management design you X. research product analytics for all the digital products we do with another group here that's responsible for the physical hardware but we do all the digital side %HESITATION in terms of the product management design work what's the most important thing I need to know to step into your role here a lot of my job these days is about building teams  great software is a with a social art  your job is essentially I can too creating rock bands that you need to construct and pull together the right musicians the right people to be able to play in a band together well Sir certainly have been products that have been made by individuals but that where there are rock stars who make an incredible product %HESITATION I don't think that's the methodology we have here how you foster create those teams as units how you stay in touch with them so you understand if something's going awry if one of the members doesn't mesh with the other members at the end of the day if you can step back and say well we've got %HESITATION  rock band and a country western band and a death metal band to waive the flavors of bands are that you need they can make amazing music that's what this world what is an average day like for you here at work at  we have numerous teams all working in parallel and I tried spends much of my time as possible being gauge of those teams understanding that road blocks that they're hitting the challenges that they're running into and trying to connect the dots between those teams so that the work that they're doing really fits nicely together the %HESITATION then the other piece of it is %HESITATION the recruiting piece of my job which is you know we're trying to build more more of those teams out so  talking to lots of people on a daily basis who are potential product managers potential designers who are interested in what we're doing and figure out if they could be a member of one of those teams  what is your job role when you joined what was your job like that and how has it changed over the past few years when I joined the company we were a little bit less than ten people %HESITATION so we're a little bit north of two hundred twenty people now so %HESITATION pretty different feel of company back that %HESITATION my role was essentially the same role that I have now %HESITATION it was just that I did a lot more of the work myself I was actually doing interface design I was actually doing product requirements I was figuring out stuff at a much more hands on way wears locally these days we have %HESITATION much more talented people to do the actual work better you know me actually doing interface design  if you were a kid growing up what was the thing that you wanted to be I want to be an artist when I grow up and how did you get from being an artist to being in the tech industry Sir %HESITATION I went to college and %HESITATION ended up getting a liberal arts degree I got a bachelor's in %HESITATION in psych from Vassar College and is really at the end of my education that I came to the realization that I really did want to academia I didn't want to do psychology I wanted to make stuff one design build and make stuff since then I had to figure out how do you go from a degree in psychology to building in making and designing stuff attempted to explore the field of industrial design but you actually have real credentials as a designer to get into that which I didn't have and so I found that I could actually transition my experience in doing psychology to working in the software world and that became a segue to doing product management and actually making products of software and everything else I just learn by doing and another job there was one specific class I think was really instrumental for me which was in cognitive science really mixed everything from computer science to %HESITATION neurobiology to psychology to anthropology ultimately  management making software is also very multi disciplinary it's really understanding how engineering help design and how the business all get mixed together and so I think with that combination of things that made me feel very passionate excited about being able to apply that multi disciplinary approach to making something they'll do you have something that you do that is a creative outlet with young kids fit bitten trying to actually stay healthy %HESITATION and just spend time with the family doesn't leave a lot outside of that %HESITATION that said my latest practice which has been awesome is my eldest son has become really interested in drawing monsters so every night %HESITATION before I go to bed I draw him a new monster and I leave that out on the kitchen table and so when he gets up at five fifteen in the morning he gets excited he goes downstairs he finds the monster he colors the monster in which also has the double effect of actually let me sleep in for another fifteen to twenty minutes %HESITATION but also means that I get to draw the monster every night from like as you see more and more people walking around with these that that's on and talking about their status as I feel for you you know when I started fit bed it is still very much of an early adopter kind of geeky product and to see it go from being this early adopter %HESITATION product when it was launched to tech crunch to help being in every single best by %HESITATION being in the Korean over twenty thousand retail store fronts %HESITATION nationwide in the US alone %HESITATION the and and and many many countries around the world  it's pretty amazing it happened super fast  and you know when I get on bart and I see someone wearing a fit that when I go to the gym and see people wearing fits %HESITATION it's amazing societally we've used engineering and technology to engineer activity out of our lives for many many decades whether it's %HESITATION remote controls or software games or elevators or escalators or cars or whatever that technology is so much of it actually the consequence of it is it makes you sit around a lot more move less and so to use technology to kind of fight back the other direction to interject more activity into people's lives is is an amazing mission and when you think about what's the challenges that we're facing societally  it has to do with the fact that we spend most of our day sitting in front of a computer which is not what we were biologically designed to do city use technology to bring awareness and engagement to begin activity is a fantastic job at
