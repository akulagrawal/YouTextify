hi my name is Marcin the blonde from coding blonde and today let's talk about what happens when you X. meets blockchain I've interviewed Kate who's had a fascinating journey into you X. design and ended up doing user experience design for blockchain products and has very interesting tips and insights to share with us let's go for it  it's great to be here  thanks for taking time of course in  so you want to change product I do  why would you say  I need  pretty much because they're a product and every product needs US what is special about the blockchain is that it's a new technology %HESITATION it's a it's a lot of interest a lot of  here's our building things a lot of companies are interested in it and what I think the space really need now is that kind of user experience  view point because people are going to  we want to understand how to use them so we can build a better product and the blockchain answer essentially making from the extra help they become the street because a lot of people don't read  so if the design  they will be yes just  yeah unfortunately when you're at the forefront of something you are also educating everybody about it and it's it's kind of our responsibility now to be like this is the change  hello this is a very friendly product that will explain  and so what would you say that  this difference between  well it's a regular  it is signing  for  part of it is absolutely the education is that you're dealing with something that most people are familiar with but kind of as an aside to that you're also dealing with something  a small group of people are very familiar with  the thing is about so you're at the same time trying to empower people to own their own data their own currency but also that is they're taking their own security into their own  is a very kind of fragile balance between  allowing people to completely on something and helping them not mess that essentially anything that is pretty much the biggest difference is that you are messages to users and it's about a lot of important things  and you're also sending best practices for the future so no pressure no pressure at all  how do you and  new industry the surprising you feel I'm I have a pretty pretty patchwork background I'm even before coming to you live teaching experience finance experience before finally shifting into the U. S. space so it kind of led me to the blockchain was %HESITATION  interest in systems financial systems and help people out and I think right now the black jeans a lot of great ideas and even go beyond financing fiat currency in  and it's just  when I saw this opportunity I was really excited to be part of the new technology kind of set the groundwork for what you ex will be in the space for the future how people interact with it what it can do is really helping it out with the skills and strengths I have since you got into the industry I recently  sign  Jeez  skills how people  like to start to explore  Jeez how would you recommend them to get into  you know there was a different ways to get into it my recommendations would be start downloading cryptocurrency wallet on your phone and just using them and thinking right how my experiencing this what would I do if there are a ton of meet ups in all size towns and cities where people were blockchain insouciance go to them to network their people are really welcoming in the space they want more people they want to learn they want to build products and just read about it there's a lot of news there a lot of communities out there online if you want to go out and meet people go online and start talking and seeing people are very vocal about what they want right now with their experiences are and I just kind of diving in the taking to get that experience as what we've all been doing since the beginning and they know that there is starting to be a great need for you let's designers across the world in the space so companies are also certainly looking for people with any kind of you experience and willing to kind of bring them up to date on this  a lot of  I said  it's very important to us  a little sometimes uses are any more people  these are really  yeah absolutely yeah definitely and companies are willing to educate communities online and willing to educate there are massive online courses about introducing people to the point even in those are all great  Gary Miller  they were the main  room was kind all male  what would your advice  women are thinking of  she  we don't know where to start  I mean to be hesitant because it is so male dominance  go for it if I have found the space to be very welcoming and very inclusive especially in Denver is that they want everybody in the world to be involved in this and that there  everybody they want to meet you halfway and you just have to go out we have to get there you you see if you are a woman and you Lexi one billion blockchain you already have the skills that I have the strength to go do it just yet just do it yourself out there and just find the people that recognize to ten because you're worth it meet ups  the what local like meetup dot com start meeting people who are just interested start looking on what like community website and seeing where the people are talking about it where it's being mentioned and  yeah I mean I know he can be easier said than done but you have to start somewhere me means we'll start talking to people  yeah  who are already in the  it's less intimidating like  what you just said  a lot of employees  get out  you are worth it they want you they need to  absolutely including people concerned about tech  a certain reputation I have found  teen space itself to be different from other tech areas and Kennedy familiar with general like T.  %HESITATION departments in companies and everything black teen is a little different blockchain is really focused on getting all the voice out there so they want to voice your choices are to be heard  go for it  what  full  this is  and they can be great  sure  now  their abilities  %HESITATION industry  you're welcome  thank you so much for giving me the interview once a  and it was very very interesting to hear your thoughts on blockchain and why he wakes is so important in that area if you guys want to follow the kids on Twitter the link is the low and also there's a link to her personal audio and some other resources that she has recommended for you including books so yes going to the description right now it's scroll down and find it I hope you enjoy this video and I'm sorry about the background noise were at a cafe that was about to close so logically you think people would be leaving it but now it seemed like there was a party or something like that so yeah I'm sorry about the bargain right yes if you have any comments or suggestions or ideas please let me know in the comments below or on my Instagram for my blog hooting burned out home yes book market and subscribe to my newsletter for concert here where can I say it have a wonderful time of the day you're currently experiencing by
