hi rob grant and I am Gary Martin from RG ET you dot com today were sitting down to talk with Sandra about his life and his career  just terrific and really wonderful opportunity for us we appreciate it why you're so very welcome and very very pleased to be here %HESITATION let's kind of begin at the beginning do you want to talk a little bit about how you get into photography like where you grew up what were your influences were sure sure %HESITATION well I'm a native of Elgin Illinois and %HESITATION I remember it was sixteen years old and I picked up by an American photo magazine and flipping through the page number lane and I've done my role in you know flipping through these pages and again I never heard of the photographer Irving Penn because this is all new to me and ran across a couple of images that Irving had taken one of Pablo Picasso and another one of this French theatre actress  collect her name and how many pages in in in %HESITATION the stark  incredibly sexy dramatic black and white portraits of these people in Hannah something happened to me I would I would just like who are these people  you know how did Irving capture these these images I want to know more about this subject because of the way that pan had photographed them something went off on me that day you know %HESITATION you know and I really had no idea in life really what I wanted to be yeah you know we said like a Grand Prix race car driver that is not happening  but you know Alston this interest came in to me about you know photography and I wanted to know more and I want to learn more so in only began taking some classes at my high school and went off to %HESITATION Elgin community college and took their photo classes there and I had some wonderful wonderful teachers that really helped me out and guided me and actually sent me on my way and said you know what factor to to leave here go out into the world sticking together then they kick me out yeah  %HESITATION is a champion of the world and said you know what you need to go to you need to get to work in the business so you know I found a job in photography and you come here to Chicago to know it was it was out in the suburbs %HESITATION I was working with a gentleman by the name of Michael Camacho is right started I think was eighteen years old and work for about three years with Michael come much and I knew that you know I knew very little I knew very very very little I mean I was really really really you know just getting my feet wet and trying to figure this whole thing out you know Michael shot food and product %HESITATION I knew as I was reading that I needed to get downtown I need to to get into a big metropolitan city start working with some of the bigger name for two  the first  we're coming down to of tower by the name of David deal goes by the name mean big deal now and I came down and saw David and his wife Rosemary and and knocked on their door beautiful beautiful studio on Harvard street I was just I walked in I was just like in all scenes just magnificent photographs on the wall is just absolutely beautiful  basically told %HESITATION David and rose merry remember I said that interview together with them and said I will do anything for you clean your toilets answer your phones washer floors %HESITATION I would just like to be here in the studio and %HESITATION I'll do anything in David I remember Dave looking goes you know what I really love your attitude but I just  really don't need anybody right now  and the next day rose merry called means as we watch back in the studio we really loved your attitude so when you come back and work for us makes a huge difference when you're really willing to put yourself out there I know I start the same way working working for the studio just for free yeah to get in yeah %HESITATION yeah you need the apprenticeship to really get in and and understand the business and how it works you really really really do any and I think it's very important to also start at the bottom yeah I mean a lot of kids come out of school today they come to work for me %HESITATION you know a big big big %HESITATION educator of five Columbia College now use a lot of their students and they're good they're good they're good good good workers but I think you know the working mentality is little bit different today in a lot of them have hopes of coming in and getting right and camera in you know you really need to learn and start right  the bottom and learn what it takes to have a presentable studio you know learned at that toilet is very very important to be clean when your clients come in at the floors need to be clean food needs to be out there they need to be taken care of you know you're basically a runner for the first three four years but a good runner will get his job done  and then come out into the studio and learn what's going on in the studio you know there's the best way I think to learn you get in here you start from the bottom you do your thing it do it do it well you do it to perfection and get out there and you know everybody %HESITATION industry that the full time crew sees what's going on anyone involved yeah that's one of pitfalls with people coming out of schools today everything's happening at the speed of light %HESITATION literally I mean the singer images or other people's images on a screen and it can go from one website to the next were you know again like you really this is your education around in this incredible collection of books and it's a much slower pace of investing time and researching other photographers and sitting there seem to work and how they captured like how they captured their subject %HESITATION and really understanding that which is very different I think it's a pitfall for people coming out of school today cameras do so much  the web moves at such a fast pace that's very hard to slow down and really mastercraft yeah you're so right I mean %HESITATION your photography is part of my  every day in the life you know %HESITATION this isn't something that I do part time and I've done it full full time has been part of my life every single day for my whole life the last forty years you know what to make that decision when I saw that work by Irving in  new that I want to be a photographer I needed  you know my job to learn everything I possibly could about photography and you know I have close to eight hundred books in which I you know I I buy these books right and they inspire me you know I dream about you know how this whatever qualities amazing images I dissect the images really look at trying inside the photographers had where was he at what was his idea what was he trying to achieve that day the lighting I mean it's  eight a single image has is so complex a great single images so complex in a few can really create something as powerful and make it iconic there's so much it goes into that shot  how long did it take you to actually refer to yourself as a photographer I know you were working in the photography industry but how long did it take for you actually said you know I'm I'm working photographer what a great question you know  I was eager to take to get out there and get on my own but  I think the education that I got you know working about four years with David deal was a great apprenticeship I mean I learned a lot about the business %HESITATION I learned a lot about what it takes to to do a brilliant photograph a photograph with an idea something that's an impactful I learned about advertising I learn about promotion which is probably when the biggest parts of our business that I think a lot of young photographers don't understand in I believe heavily having a promotion %HESITATION so you know it was four years with David you know three years out in the suburbs and probably another two years of freelancing try almost  okay good close to get tenure dues of working for other people before I decided that I was ready to go out there and open my own studio and I went out there as was working you know I'd work a day which I mean we were to David's twelve fourteen hours a day six days a week David was probably the busiest photographer when the business in the country for sure in Chicago you know working against six days a week we were nonstop and it was my responsibility to every single morning that studio had to be spotless so we may have shuttle ten o'clock that evening I'd have to stay in under two hours and prepare pre light clean studio have it all set up for the next day and then  can be in my car go back out to Elgin as a single parent raising a daughter by myself it was insane you know but I remember also finding time to get into David's studio and working on my portfolio so it was a twenty four seven job to get to that place refining thought comfortable to go out on my own and do my thing and what were your first images you were you were drawn to the portraiture an American photo you working for a photography shooting a lot of product and so yeah so what was your first four full and first my first images were all product yeah they were beer poor here can %HESITATION %HESITATION their product %HESITATION so I hadn't quite yet  %HESITATION  full of my  needs of shooting people it will it is starting to build because I remember %HESITATION having my own studio in first counting at which was  you know it was just crazy crazy money but I was working from Montgomery wards  and that you know I was a product shooter but I felt something was wrong and I thought my soul just really kind of like crumbling knows that I was dying creatively others died you just or something wasn't happening for me and then when they click because when my doing one way during shooting you know this product up I'm a people person I love people I love people's faces I love to you know to brace people I love to interact with people why my shooting jewelry why am I shouting product unite in in in at that moment right there I made the decision that that was yeah yeah I remember what I did as it is I went out and I would like to blues clubs in Chicago  and I'd stay there for the whole show in at the end and I to go to the blues artists in asking for could do photo session with them  they come to my studio in a we do these amazing photo sessions  junior wells Buddy Guy John Lee Hooker while just these amazing guys that I was able to talk into coming to my studio that night like would you guys go back with the father was somewhere  the whiskey something now the  I mean we've got all night long you know %HESITATION shooting Borchers you know these guys be partying like crazy in I'd be shooting them and it was like oh my god this is unbelievable and that at that time I really could even you know doing my work I can you know for an assistant some doing all this by myself you know and I get these guys their portraits they would be happy I was like you know  your total war top of the world because I for two I love the blues music in an  I'm shooting the best blues artists in the world but that's how I built my first people portfolio for the really interesting lessons there is you're in the industry that you love yeah that was your dream and you're miserable because you were doing the exact sector that you wanted to see issues you switched yeah everything fell into place for everything fell into place and I was a new person of the note energy that happened you know with with my work in a new new enthusiasm also and I felt like I had reason  you know take that this camera was going to open doors  all over the world for me to meet some of the most interesting people in the world  your portraiture really runs the gamut I mean this black and white is really gritty with great %HESITATION there's colors very highly polished production so when you're thinking about a portrait like when you go down to the blue square when you went on the blues clubs were you watching the guys thinking about what you want to shoot then or did you wait to kind of get back in the studio one where your inspiration for the poor to come like we're just at the ballot well in in the beginning and the beginning again I I I really feel that %HESITATION Irving Penn was such a huge influence in my career and my life %HESITATION that I would only sailing mimic is fine but it was a huge inspiration and meet you know it was very classic lighting up one light was really my thing you know maybe two maybe a little bit of a background light but I kept it simple you know in I believe I still believe I still believe today in keeping it simple I don't think you need to have ten lights to make a better picture I think you can make a great great great  sure with one light I need I think it's you know it's the I. it's the idea to composition it's the mood it's at little secret that you're able to pull from your subject that makes your viewer want to know more about that person is very very very simple to very simple idea  but it's hard to do I mean it's hard you have to pull up the right emotion and we know a motion is the connecting piece right now neck that's withdraw the person to be ran that's a difficult thing to pull out in a way that's really effective yeah you know I've I've found the best way to work with people whether you working with you know and an amazing celebrity like John Malkovich %HESITATION Michael Jordan or just a %HESITATION a simple normal person off the street is respect respect and honor %HESITATION I always like to try to spend some time to get to know my  subject before a shoot them I'm really big on  having a nice gentle conversation with them I'm never demanding very soft and very hands on I I love to grab my subjects hands and feel their hands and hold them for the first second might be weird for you know I think the  but you know I hold a great but then they feel the gentleness I think in my hand and I think they hear my voice something happens to them Davison begin it's safe yeah they know that they're in the same have you always done this like well it's about a man so since the the days of the blues yes that's that started yeah I'd just like it's my demeanor being gentle and nice and honorable and respectful in any situation in life you're always come out ahead  what's relationship is business it takes a long time to build these relationships takes a long time to win a client him really nice you know you don't lose them the answer you have to build a relationship you know %HESITATION even though I've been in this business for forty years and probably one of the most sought out photographers in the world I'm still very very very grateful for every single job that I come in comes into my studio because they could have gone to somebody else you know I am not  you know  someone who's going to give you something that's so different that you probably could go to Najaf Connor any legal which our Watson or mark Seliger or any  number of of of of other photographers of when I compete against those people and you get that job for me it deserves into a graceful mess that you've got that job you're very very very lucky there's there is a thousand other guys out there and women that what your job absolutely you know and %HESITATION they can go to a job and a lot of are much much cheaper cheaper than I am so it's when you get that job very grateful for any treaties you treat your client with gratitude  let's talk about hands %HESITATION when I look at your website I I find it really fascinating that Hans was one of the three still image galleries that you have  they're obviously hugely influential for you and I think that's a big niche %HESITATION that you're really putting out there just for an entire gallery of hands yeah how much work you think that drugs for you and what do you what do you think clients perception of that hang gallery is when you're viewing because I think it speaks a lot about you as you have time thank you I'm well I tell you  I've been shooting hand for thirty years you know I hand you look at a hand like a face as a novel line and it has a story about a person it tells you a lot about that person near the lines in a person's eyes underneath the I. two crow's feet tells me stories about a person I think I first learned this when I should my American bikers project about twenty seven years ago you know is traveling around the country shooting shooting bikers and you know instead of doing the bike on top of the bike you know and and and have it pulled back shot portrait I came in tight you know and I started seeing stories at thirteen novelty starts in the road on these bikers faces and then I saw other he ends their hands at work with its equipment work with these tools work on these bikes they were tough they were strong today they had grease underneath the fingers they told stories told me a lot about who these people were you know so it just became a huge part by you know  my love of of a target in an H. and H. electric against like portrait twenty or just like portrait but I've had some tremendous campaigns %HESITATION that I've worked on over the years that were just surrounded by hands and it's something I'll always effectuate me so let's let's talk about projects and it seems that you have been so prolific you produce multiple books had countless exhibitions  just in order to do all you must be working multiple projects at the same time how do these projects formulate for for you and how long do you put into them meaning a lot of these things obviously happened over the course of a year or several years yeah yeah  well you know for for me  as a commercial photographer you know  it's always been extremely important for me to show my clients my personal work and work the comes from my heart and my soul you know  I may  %HESITATION solver when it comes to the commercial work and I love solving problems I love making project you know really turn around and be  wonderful for my clients clients  but I think for me it's been so important for me to do personal work and released me in touch with the work that I want to create in use this work as an Avenue to also show my client I think one of the reasons that I am today and still on top of the game you know at my age and it's it's a young young person's game yeah it can be a young person's game in less your true %HESITATION  truly dedicated and  continue to change and evolve you can beat up in this business very early  but  I've worked on personal projects that I think you have moved  people even in the commercial world and for me it's been so important to to travel to Morocco spend a month in Morocco  shooting people that %HESITATION I get it with that project I was paying homage to %HESITATION August Sanders and Irving Penn you know the work of working people portraits that idea %HESITATION Cuba I spent thirteen years going back and forth to Cuba to work on my book for Cuba %HESITATION it takes dedication passion  I love for creating imagery but what also I find these personal projects as is often I'm back to my first days of photography when I just traveled with a thirty five millimeter camera in a couple inches you know I'm not with the a team of twenty people and there's something very very very calming and and nurturing about walking the streets by herself looking for these amazing images these gems and photographing them I mean it really gave me that break from the hustle bustle crazy commercial world that I live in and it was a way for me to I I guess in some ways to  justify my being in an era of and not just be a commercial photographer but being an artist you know if it was very very very important for me to be an artist and to have my work accepted by  others that were not in the commercial world you know galleries and museums any kind of solidified for me that %HESITATION  the importance of creating imagery of of of of energy that's not for hire it takes a certain amount of dedication because you your you know what when I close my studio down for a month it's a huge overhead my boys are still being paid you know the wheels are still trying to electric still on they'll still have to the bills to have to be paid so I leave the studio to go do month project in those bills still a star rolling in so it's a huge huge huge our financial %HESITATION me in  burden to go do these projects but it's a must yeah I would %HESITATION  just to all photographers out there you know young especially is is never give up your passion for photography to create your own work and I think that's what you're gonna get known for I I I I I think when I noticed last days of your life  not gonna go down to a shot another McDonald's hamburger absolutely mother a had for so %HESITATION you know it's it's a great great living in it it makes a great problem solver but I don't think it's what you want to find yourself by I think the other thing is really beautiful about doing personal work and being free from the big cruise and and were you just out to Cameron a couple answers initial back to the basics so it's like an athlete who like Michael Jordan who would just practicing jump shot over and over and over again even though he's the best basketball player in the world it keeps his skills sharp yeah I think that's very very evident in your work the personal work that you do it has continued to grow your skills is continue to hone them and be a master which is ultimately what you want to be in what you've achieved thank you very much you know you're you're you're so correct I mean so often when we're shooting even a commercial job things happen in an instant things change something goes wrong but it's all about the experience that you've had in the past you know shooting life career whether it be your personal work or your your commercial work you draw and that and that past you draw on the knowledge that you've gained over time that helps pull you out of what could be a very very embarrassing difficult absolutely in the studio and expanded job yeah you could really blow and  it's again when you master the skills it keeps you common it gives you the ability to I can handle this yeah it's just another corpus speaking of production tell me about your production team do you rely on the most like what does your team make up  well the my team that I have working for me right now %HESITATION is the greatest team in the world  %HESITATION I have %HESITATION Akeem Zach saving my producer  %HESITATION Aaron for making my first assistant in Aaron Alan Martin you know my manager these guys make the studio run %HESITATION their tap match their experts it with the deal and without them what I do really  couldn't possibly get done this isn't the type of business that you can do it on your own I am getting calls from all over the country %HESITATION to get work done and produced now you know and these guys are willing to stay what ever takes how many hours it takes to get the job done they're the ones who do the hiring of my stylist my hair and makeup people my set builders my location scouts my models metallic I set builders again it takes it takes an army to do a single photograph and these guys have got my back in I owe so much to my team in this in an amazing team I have known it had in the past I've always seem to have had really really really really a great in house team at very important to me that the really good people  beyond that the Kerry people yeah and that  they understand but they have almost that same passion I have for the work photography and it's difficult you know when your producer in your system you're doing all the hard work for somebody else you have these dreams of going out and do it yourself I mean their sacrifice their into these guys sacrificed so much for  you know for my career and you have to embrace and love people like that I think a lot of photographers today think that you know most working photographer shooting ninety percent of the time how often would you say you are you know actually behind the lands and shooting and how how much of the time is in on the business side of things sure I'm I used to shoot  probably two hundred fifty days a year up you know you spend an airplane constantly  as I've grown in my projects get much bigger  %HESITATION much more involved  much bigger money  the competition the people competing against are the big big big bellies  you know the jobs are  our last year there's not as many of them today I'm probably shooting  maybe three jobs a month  maybe for jobs a month are not including the pro bono I do I do a tremendous amount of pro bono and for and and foundation work which again I find the very important work to do  but the works that I do are there bigger ideas you know they bring me in in the beginning of their campaigns in the foundation that that the building of the campaign and brought in to you know help out with the ideas and can have a bring it to the forefront of what  this campaign could look like so I shoot a lot less I'm also directing a lot now so I mean I'd say probably about  twenty five thirty percent my work now is directing TV commercials documentaries %HESITATION and %HESITATION you know get other personal projects but to  I shoot every day or closed everyday but commerciales probably just you know three four jobs a month would create up to about seven eight ten days a month and then you'll have your month three you have to be booked every single day  so it's it's a constant in then you know of course like you mentioned you know I have this I have this disease and a disease of creating images and working on his personal work and it's a sickness thank you have a it's a sick yes good sickness that's a good thing because I I've been a lot of trouble if I get sick %HESITATION but it is an illness because you have this passion of wanting to create imagery constantly kick your wife but you can't get away from it and I have the hardest time  knowing how to enjoy the moment you know %HESITATION I have seven books that have been published I'll receive a book that forty years and years and years I and I can't even look at it you know when I received the book from the publisher it's hard to look at it it's hard to look yeah yeah I'm never really really really had a listing what you see other things you want to change and that person is what it is and it's hard to live in the moment yeah this is great I it's hard to live in the moment right now I'm supposed to be enjoying this moment of this you know this I'm getting a a lot of publicity and this Malkovich project I did yesterday a new  %HESITATION working into my vocabulary is called trendy never heard of the word trending you're currently but I I heard I was trending on CNN Twitter and Facebook India okay him trendy talk about the project is it's a really big important one and it's with John Malkovich we've been working with now for a long time and again this is a really deep and important relationship to you it is %HESITATION talked to me a little bit about how that first of all it did not come through with I kind of know it wasn't within a company Nikon became part of it it began probably got seventeen years ago with that Steppenwolf theater %HESITATION they brought me in to begin shooting their ensemble members for their different advertisements marquees billboards but it all involved there ensemble members instead of having the sensational ensemble listed they have you know Gary Sinise Joan Allen %HESITATION we'll figure in a two credible and John Malkovich happen to be one of the ensemble members that needed that to be shot for a play that he was in in I remember John coming in and I was just having just an amazing an amazing aggression I digress sure I got my name kissed him on the forehead  you know one but %HESITATION you know I remember being a little bit intimidated at first you know with John because John is a powerful figure  and a big actor is a big big big actor he's a powerful figure in I think you can let you know whether you want to talk to you are not you know just those ice %HESITATION  but we had beautiful beautiful session together we had we created some amazing black and white portrait of a man  you know I think I hit home with John data again respect factor that I had for him but we we created we create some really really really good work I think you two are doing some very risky work initial things are you guys doing pretty going motion side is very Lasky and I think that obviously to have a great trust each other and have found a way to to be very free with each other's okay let's this is what we want to try yes well I think you nailed it when you said risky I mean we're definitely outside the box we can be dark were taking chances of John is  you know  this is amazing genius  %HESITATION he's a beautiful clean canvas for me to work on he allows me  allows me and my ideas to  formulate in and happened he's never said no to me about any idea that I've had with him  you know he mentioned to me one time to center I work with with Indian Bridget and  mark can lead to big for two hours but there's something about you the way that you work that I really really trust and I really enjoy working with you E. ainda  you know it pretty much was I know will be working together for probably a long long long time it's now it's been seventeen years yeah yeah I think it gets down to respect I think no walking they respect some of the other photographers a works with him %HESITATION and they respect him I think that the two of you just have a really deep respect for each other and have built a relationship and trust over time we have I have to say that I love the man and I have a lot of gratitude and I'm very grateful for his generosity and his %HESITATION this time is giving me his  openness I mean in in in some ways he's responsible for %HESITATION you know  a huge piece of my successes in with this exhibition that we have going on right now to get them out in the gallery %HESITATION  this home March to the masters %HESITATION I felt as it was in very important work to do and I really thought there's nobody else in the world they could have pulled it off like John Malkovich is very important for me to get John on board to do this project and you know I remember flying out to France showing John my idea of recreating you know thirty thirty five iconic images from about thirty twenty eight to thirty master photographers and the service about men women and what men and women both roles which is also different Leah I mean think about it I mean the risk that John is taking  yeah up put himself out there is Marilyn Monroe you know it could have been laughed at I I mean I didn't want this to be a purity I would it was a serious serious serious Ammash to these masters who have really inspired me in kind of developed to I am today's a photographer and I meant it to be a very serious project in when you think about some of the %HESITATION iconic images that you know together John and I are created %HESITATION  he really did an amazing job pulling it off you know we get our researchers nine about nine months of research on on on all these images that we wanted to create we had to go back to the errors of when they were shot  we had to figure out the clothing the styling  the hair the make up that they were wearing all this had to be made  brought in from all over the country we had seems just working on wardrobe and then I had to spend three weeks figured out the lighting of exactly what kind of like to do to talk first were using at these times of these portraits  planning and cranky production will really this is a huge time invest it was a huge time huge financial huge huge financial investment but it was an idea that I felt  that I needed  to conquer and to put out there you're so often today's artists I think we get ideas and we end up sitting on them in we don't follow through I think right we can be our worst enemies you know you get an idea write it down in try to follow through in it you know I think some people are worried about not doing the right thing or or it not being accepted by the masses you know I think we have to take our ideas and we have to  formulate them and we have to follow through it we have to make a Mars yeah we're gonna get some criticism nobody's gonna love everything that we do you know but I think you have to take a chance unix courage it takes courage and you have to challenge yourself you have to just you know put yourself out there and I was taking a huge risk in doing this work here in you know I know that it could keep office appeared in people could have seen it as  you know mocking or disrespectful in that would hurt you know  what I was trying to do very very very much so I'm very pleased with what we've got it's been a  good success and I'm a trend or not  congratulations thank you  on the production side of that how long did you spend on let's say one photograph how long will it take you to complete that on the shooting side that's a great question because  in every job every job I do that I believe in doing your homework  and %HESITATION figuring out  all what could go wrong before it happens  so can we did nine months of research you know we knew we had the wardrobe right my stylist Leslie pace the amazing job you know working with great great great %HESITATION seems seamstress Yutaka who built the clothes you had to close here their proper my great great great here make up %HESITATION artist Randy Wilder who research for months and months and found the here so RMIT Ernest Hemingway Einstein %HESITATION  Marilyn Monroe brought in shape with a beard and actually built that right and Josh you know we we we did our work way ahead of time and then the fact that I had every single shot  three let where the take it all down and to take very close to but we live every single shot that we did had a time I had a time took very thorough notes to knock it down  so now we got these four days of shooting with John  he Jim all those images in four days hello echo that isn't we create a seven eight shots today fourteen sixteen hour days  what was so interesting was watching John as he's getting his hair and makeup done and styling would put that  original portrait up in the mir were used in his hair make up so he could start getting into his head of how he was going to have to morph into man woman child disturb angry crazy or you know whatever it was you know you take those four shots that herb Ritts did with Jack Nicholson of the joker I mean John had to kind of go this whole gamut of craziness but he again with genius Reno pulled every single one of these images off so Julie and sat I would give John direction would start talking we start getting into the mood would start going back to that time that you know Mick Jagger was in front of David Bailey's camera Maryland rows in front of birds turns can we talk about what they're probably doing  yeah pull the mood in in what Hemingway was you know he anyway was struggling alcoholic he was going to free difficult time of his life and car shot him so I'd get John in that mood Janet already worked on sort of where he was going to go inside the dressing room but by the time we got there it was a matter of five minutes inch we were there you know in ten fifteen twenty minutes later we were done  with a shot you know I'm not a guy who have to shoot two hundred frames to know why you have it you know I knew we had it you know the last thing you want to do is have a great talent like John up there in your over shooting him a worried about yeah you don't want to do they have to be very questions yeah there's really going fourteen sixteen hour here's our digital photography is a beautiful thing you can see  you know they have a beautiful thing burning rolls of film making sure that you've cat to be it was a beautiful thing it was the only way truly you know my first thought was I wanted to create this exactly the way that the photographer stratum used with cameras they did what films it'd there would have been virtually impossible yeah you can and then at that me hace you can add that at that pace in John's time is very very very valuable and no I only had the short time with me and he's on the airplane your twenty four seven you know opera theater movies he's got a clothing line of fourteen years that he works on you know this man is is is constantly on the go so we had to be prepared in digital was the only way  simply to get this project done what was the camera that was shot on and a follow up question how important do you consider near  well I I I don't think it's the gear that  create CMH now I think it's the mind  I'm I think it's the idea  the composition  the experience  that really creates the great great great image I think that great images can be taken with so many different cameras cameras  %HESITATION and so many different types of light you know %HESITATION  I can us feel I'm a master of lights you know I I used  thirty forty different types of lighting situations you know in in a shoot  not anyone should but maybe in in a in a month and made do thirty different types of lighting situations  our camera gear you know it's it's it's it's important I think it's more of a two part compatibility would you feel comfortable with you know you know  when I'm shooting thirty five millimeters for the last thirty eight years and I work at night time you know and I can't always been my go to camera when it comes to using thirty five minutes millimeter SLRs you know %HESITATION the last few years I've become an ambassador for Nikon you know I speak and and lecture you know about photography and  night connection much the sale from like I'm I'm not a sales person at all for them but you know why I I believe in the the equipment in with larger format you know which I often have to shoot medium format %HESITATION I'm huge huge huge Hasselblad fan I've been a hot sweaty and since day one you know  important %HESITATION to know your equipment to know what you want to shoot with and you know and and and to grab the right piece equipment for the right job  and %HESITATION you know for me when it comes to portraiture out I've never been a huge huge fan of %HESITATION in a thirty five millimeter vertical %HESITATION shot portrait you know it it's just it's too thin for me and I you know I love the horizontal doing more of a landscape portraiture with thirty five millimeter but when I need to do a vertical shot I need to resort to %HESITATION to a quarter and give me that six seven for me and it's very important for me and I'm also a huge huge huge lover of the house about square format which of course you can't get with thirty five millimeters so I think you know it's it's the equipment doesn't make you a better photographer it makes you more comfortable with what you're working with  again I think you could probably give me a ten dollar camera  as the camera and I'm gonna probably knock off a pretty beautiful shot for you nice  on that project specifically what camera was used was in a variety of cameras or is it just one of the Malkovich project I used a variety of cannabis yet again I was very important for me to be true to the formats that were being shot by the photographers at that time so of course I use thirty five millimeter I used to and a quarter I used four by five I used Polaroid %HESITATION well so you know I really really really kind of opened up and was allowed you know the project to flow the way I thought it should be should flow and that's be true to what the photographers were working with what about the post processing on the entire project and impose process in general you a huge part of that are you doing this all yourself is this being given off to a different team I do not know  my hands don't ever touch the computer never it's just not who I am now I'm a director in the visionary you know I'm the idea person %HESITATION I pass off any retouching that I need done to a wonderful book take place to use J. S. graphics or my guy Aaron is extremely extremely verse with the computer up it's not what I do  %HESITATION I direct when I want done every single Schatten there's not a shot that goes out this this my doors without my  one hundred percent stamp will provide it has my look it has to Sandra look to it  I'm the Malkovich job I used the are you  post like the photographers who created is I kind of shot used the darkroom okay is about dodging in burning vignetting out whatever kind of they did is what I allowed myself to do is images wants to be made in manipulated in the computer to make these images you know I'm really struggling today  with Instagram  photographers who won taking pictures and putting them out into the world with no idea you know they're just popping images just pop up images and then %HESITATION using these programs that they're hitting the button and they're putting the styles of photography that took people like ourselves along years and years and years to perfect I would argue they're not photographers Instagram is %HESITATION making photographer exactly a filter in Instagram or whatever doesn't make you photographers and knowing light and how to work with it and knowing composition and knowing your equipment and how how to make a camera second nature in your hands liak and react to your subject of phony that's being a photographer yeah %HESITATION not hitting the button and Instagram posting I agree and I was a big part of what this Malkovich project was about was about an idea you know eight eight eight big big idea and following through with the big idea and not just putting images out to put images out you know I really think about what images I put out into the market you know are they powerful are they moving are they making people think a little bit in awe and it's you know it's a different world we live in Instagram is  a huge huge part of %HESITATION our younger generation and it's not going to go away but I'm hoping I'm hoping that maybe I can get this younger generation to maybe just take a look at what they're doing and think about it a little bit more take a look at some classic classic photography can understand really what the ideas were behind these very important photographs let let's talk a little bit of a huge transition and that is directing %HESITATION no cameras now days being able capture motion has really opened up a whole New World for photographers and and won the consolation is very dangerous it's very difficult for a lot of people to make the transition from photographer to director director of photography %HESITATION you've been on the absolute for from that and done a beautifully Kinnickinnic tell us a little bit about the process and and the risks that you felt that you were taking is removed from doing so most emotion  well first I you know I I've actually been asked to direct for probably  over twenty years now yet I never stepped into the arena because I truly was enjoying the power of the single image I really believed in the single image and you know I continue to be on top of that game %HESITATION I was highly sought out  a major major major campaigns doing really really really well  but then I think was time for a change of time for a new challenge and %HESITATION  you know the next step should be was directing in in I. in and really I was a director as a still photographer that's really what I did as a still photographer now I'm just taking moving pictures and putting them in a sequence that makes a fifteen or thirty a sixty second or or a documentary whatever I'm shooting makes the store  you know I've treated very very very very similar to how I %HESITATION really relate with still photography the key there they'll is  not taking on too much yourself you know it's about to be hiring really good people  you know surrounding yourself with a great great team you know I would find it very difficult to direct and also be the DP  so I chose to just direct in higher grade teepees to work my camera with me I believe I know my clients so much more of who I am and what to look at with the feel of the if of whatever campaign it is that we're working on I just believe that it would been way too much for me to take a and bark  so %HESITATION I'm enjoying directing very very very much and we've been very fortunate we're going to really wonderful campaigns did you find that I find that this kind of a language berry sometimes between still and motion %HESITATION did you know I mention it right no question there's some difficulties for a photographer to understand %HESITATION the language of motion yeah did you run into that and how we have to be overcome absolute %HESITATION ice now I've been directing for about five six years in I will announce to the whole crew that guys I came from the still world  you put out there but we  that's a supporter me up I said I will say some terminology that's probably not correct you know %HESITATION you know again first thing I do is I go make friends with the whole crew I go shake everybody's hand thank them for being there and get them to be a you know my  team mate and I do I really want your the again of my board and I truly do explain to me like I came from the still world in my terminology is gonna be live a different than yours but you know it crosses over people get it yeah and %HESITATION again you know I probably made a few people laughed at some of the you know terminology that I've used during a you know a motion shoot but you know it all works out and I get a lot of fun you know you've got eighty people and said that you're working all to achieve you know one goal is to put out a great spot since a lot of fun you know if it really is another children I would love to get a little information is that of Cuba you were hired by Cuba to photograph their athletes which one how did they find you yeah that's across the highway or loose dirt  if you change money  %HESITATION the phone me I was I was in Cuba in nineteen ninety nine I was working on one of my books that has not been published yet %HESITATION is a book on boxing and if you're a new book and boxing got to go to you have to go to Cuba because Cuba produces basically  per capita the best boxers in the whole world you know I think that they walk out usually more gold and silver than any other country of course I had to go to Cuba %HESITATION the government and a government official who is working for the Olympics %HESITATION ended up seeing some of my work brought the idea to the forefront you know what do you think you know eagles are our country has not had pictures of our athletes since nineteen fifty nine cents cash  took took charge I mean there's NO elimination no more photography in all of our activities in this part of the trade embargo you had actually break through political barriers between the US and Cuba in order to do this is very added the chosen American photographer to do this project you know with the embargo in the battle going on between countries %HESITATION it was you know  they could have chose somebody else I was there they like my work %HESITATION  maybe a little bit of small is talking  hello I'm the guy %HESITATION but again I came back and did the project for nothing you know in the reason we did the projects because I ended up shooting ninety of Cuba's %HESITATION top athletes you know %HESITATION world champions Olympic gold silver bronze winners are the top baseball players in the world every sport we covered anywhere that the top of the country and again since nineteen fifty nine none of them have been recorded so in the history books there was nothing for their kids to take a look back and read about their heroes as there was no information at all for me nothing  so I can run this country were you know athletes are  %HESITATION pedestal absent we know everything about their whole life absolutely yeah it's incredible yeah we know everything about them you know usually you photographed a ton of of U. S. athletes as well it's been a it's been a very large part of the market it has been yeah %HESITATION you know I was in the heyday of Michael Jordan and the bulls you know those are good Michael all the time huge advertising campaigns together out one of my favorite shooter  with Mohammed Ali when the most beautiful man and yeah in you know in the world but it was a really special shoot  remember only have a few minutes with with with Mohammed and I was already all set up and we sat him down we did the portrait which took basically about ninety seconds %HESITATION and I was done this is how they're just a crowd around and I had to release them remember going up there with all these people watching in  I said Mohammad I I must tell you that I've been a huge huge huge fan of of of you  yes I love you in the ring with Howard Cosell but I must say I love you so much more today for what year is it represent as a man into America and as an ambassador of America I so appreciate everything you've done I really think you're out in amazing it is something that sort of turned around I was done I said what I need to say also in this huge hand  on my shoulder turns me around this is when he was still pretty healthy manner strong big he had turned around brings you down to put both hands what is huge hands on my face and kisses me on my lips  thank you those are some of the most beautiful words I've ever heard when I remember right I just started to cry  it just hit me I am just like those Muhammad Ali that just a new user so sincere with what he just said to me better if it moves me to point to tears looking back on your career what would you have done anything differently  I don't think I would have done anything differently I mean so many people want me to move to New York or London  my agents  you know to be the superstar photographer I guess you have to be in New York or London area and %HESITATION I was a single parent %HESITATION I made a decision to stay here in Chicago  %HESITATION it was the right decision and I look back at it you know in here sometimes you're  art pose that you know what a half by  the decision was the right decision stay home take care via a my daughter stay close to my mom who helped me so much yet it just felt like the right thing to do so I look back and and and and I like the way that things went in my career there's so many things happen by chance you know the American bikers project that I worked on and never knew was gonna blow up the way it did going to you know an eight page spread in the New Yorker this John Malkovich piece that I'm working on right now you never really know what's going to be that decisive moment that such a career to that next time you know and %HESITATION  it feels good the career felt like it went on the path that was supposed to go see and I'm very happy with everything they said that  me and my team M. as a father as a photographer what we've achieved so when you wanna be when you grow up fifth wanna be a race car driver  Google yeah what Dr green pre cars  these well thank you so much for sitting down with us you're welcome as it's been an absolute pleasure to meet you %HESITATION you've always been an inspiration for me as a portrait photographer so this is been a fantastic moment for me and %HESITATION for RG  he's a sitting down with his manager and realize so it's really great to sit down thank you so much guys is like I am a huge pleasure and honor what you guys are doing you guys are doing some great great work and you know it's your your type programming that helps so many of our young photographers  in a dream in the letters and help those dreams come true so they can
