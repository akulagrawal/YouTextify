in the great nineteen eighties movie the blues brothers there's a scene where John Belushi  goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment in Chicago for the very first time it's a cramp tiny space and it's just three feet away from the train tracks  as Johnson Sundance bad a train goes rushing by rattling everything in the room  John asks how often does the train go by  Dan replies so often you won't even notice it and then if something falls off the wall  we all know what he's talking about as human beings we get used to everyday things really fast  as a product designer it's my job to see those everyday things to feel them and try to improve upon the  for example  see this piece of fruit  see this little sticker  that's the car wasn't there when I was a kid  but somewhere as the years passed someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit why so can be easier for us to check out at the grocery cart  well that's great we can get in out of the store quickly  but now there's a new problem  we get home and we're hungry and we see this for right juicy piece of fruit on the counter which one to pick it up any  except now we have to look  for this little sticker  and do you get it with our nails damaging the flash  then rolling up that sticker you know what I mean and then trying to flick it off your fingers  right  it's not fun  not at all  but something interesting happened  see the first time you did it you probably felt those feelings you just want to eat the piece of fruit but it was you get you felt upset you just want to dive in  by the tenth time you start to become less less upset he started to just do that peeling the label off by the hundred time at least for me I became numb to it I simply picked up the piece of fruit  Doug gather with my nails trying to flick it off  and then wonder was there another sticker  so why is that why do we get use everyday things was human beings we have limited brain power  so our brains in Cody everyday things we do into habits  so we can free up space to learn new things  it's a process called a bit too ation and it's one of the most basic ways as humans we learn  no appreciation is always bad  remember learning to drive  I sure do  your hands clinched the ten into on the wheel  looking at every single object out there the cars the lights the pedestrians is a nerve wracking experience  so much so that I couldn't even talk to anyone else in the car  our and I couldn't even listen to music  but then something interesting happened as the weeks went by  driving became easier and easier  you have **** waited at  it started become finding second nature  man you could talk to your friends again listen to music so there's a good reason why our brains to be two eight things if we didn't we notice every little detail all the time  it would be exhausting and we have no time to learn about new things  but sometimes the beach where she is in good  if it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us well that's bad  and if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems well then that's really bad  comedians know all about this Jerry Seinfeld entire career was built I noticed in those little details those idiotic things we do every day that we don't even remember  he tells us about the time he visited his friends and he just wanted to take a comfortable shower he reach out and grab the handle and turned it slightly one way it was a hundred degrees too hot  and then he turned the other way and it was a hundred degrees to call he just wanted a comfortable shower now we've all been there  we just don't remember it but Jerry did and that's the comedians job but designers innovators and entrepreneurs it's our job to not just noticed those things but to go one step further and try to fix them  see this this person this is merry Anderson  in nineteen oh two in New York  she was visiting  it was a cold wet snowy day and she was warm inside a street car  as she was going to our destination she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off  the the access now so we can drive safely  when you open the window though he let all this cold wet air inside making all the passengers miserable  now probably most of those passengers just thought it's a fact of life he's got open the window to clean it that's just how it is  but Mary didn't  I thought  what is the driver could actually clean the windshield from the inside so that he can stay safe and drive and the passengers can actually stay warm  so she picked out her sketchbook right then and there and begin drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper  no it's a product designer I try to learn from people like merry  try to see the world the way it really is  not the way we think it is  why because it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees  but it's hard to solve the problem that almost no one sees  now some people think you're born with disability or you're not  as if Mary Anderson was hard wired at birth to see the world more clearly  that wasn't the case for me I had to work at  during my years at apple  the job challenge this  to come in to work every day  to see  our products through the eyes of the customer the new customer the one that has fears and possible frustrations  and hopefully exhilaration that the new technology product to work straight away from them  he called it staying beginnings and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster easier and seamless for the new customers  so I remember this clearly in the very early stages of the I pod  see back in the nineties being a gadget freak like I am  I would rush out to the store  for the very very latest gadgets  I take all the time to get to the store I check out I come back home I'd start time boxes and then there was another little sticker the one that said charged before use what  I can't believe it I just spent all this time buying this product and now I have to charge me for you so I have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that cover the new toy was crazy but you know what almost every product back then did that when it had batteries and you had to charge before used  well Steve noticed that  any said we're not gonna let that happen to our product  so what do we do  typically when you have a product that has a hard drive in it you wanted for about thirty minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive is going to be working years later for the customer after they played on the box  what do we do instead  we ran that product for over two hours  why well first off we can make a higher quality product be easy to test and make sure it was great for the customer  but most importantly the battery came fully charged right out of the box ready to use so that customer just  with all that that exhilaration could just start using the product it was great and it worked people like that now today almost every product then you get that battery power comes out of the box fully charged even if it doesn't have a hard drive  but back then we noticed that that detail and we fixed it I know everyone else does that as well no more charged before use  so why am I telling you this  well it's seeing the invisible problem not just the obvious problem  that's important  not just for product design but for everything we do you see their invisible problems all around us ones we can solve  so first we need to see them to feel that  so I'm hesitant to give you any tips about neuroscience and psychology there's far too many experienced people the tech community will know much more about that than I ever will  let me leave you with a few tips that I do and we all can do  to fight him be tuition  my first tip is to look broader  you see when you're tackling a problem sometimes there are a lot of steps that lead up to the problem and sometimes a lot of steps after  if you can take a step back and look broader maybe you can change some of those boxes before  problem maybe you can combine them maybe can remove them all together to make that better  take thermostats for instance in the nineteen hundreds when they first came out you really simple to use your term up or turn them down people understood them  but in the nineteen seventies the energy crisis struck and customer started thinking about how to save energy  so what happened thermostat designers decided to add a new step in so just trying up and down you know how to program she could tell the temperature you wanted a certain time  now that seem great  every thermostat it started adding that feature  but it turned out  no one saved any energy  now why is that  couldn't predict the future they just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season year to year  so no one was saving energy and what happened thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that program instead  they made better you ice  they may better documentation  it's still years later people were not saving any energy  because they just couldn't predict the future  so what do we do  put a machine learning algorithms instead of the program that would simply watch when you turned it up and down what would you like to certain temperature when you got up or when you went away and you know what it worked people are saving energy without any programming  so it doesn't matter what you're doing if you take a step back and look at all the boxes  maybe there's a way to remove one or combined  we can make that process much simpler  so that's my first  look broader  my second set  it's to look closer  one of my greatest teachers was my grandfather  he taught me all about the world  he taught me how things were built and how they repair the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project  I remember one story he told me about screws  and about how you need to have the rights to for the right job there are many different screws wood screws metal screws anchors concrete screws the list went on and on  our job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customers themselves without professionals  so what do we do  I remember that story that my grandfather told me  and so we thought how many different screws could we put in the box was gonna be two three four five because there's so many different Walters so we thought about it we optimize it we came up with two different three different screws to put in the box  we thought that was going to solve the problem but it turned out it didn't  so we ship the ship the product and people work have a great experience  so what did we do we went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right  and we designed a special screw a custom screw  much to the chagrin of our investors they were like why he's been  so much time in a little screw get out there and sell more we said we will sell more if we get this right  and it turned out we did with that custom will screw that was just one screw in the box was easy to mount and put on the wall  so if we focus on those tiny details  the ones we might would that we may not see  and we look at them we say are those important or though are are is that the way we've always done it maybe there's a way to get rid of those  so my last piece of advice is to think younger  every day I'm confronted with interesting questions for my three young kids they come up with questions like why can't cars fire on traffic  why do my shoe laces have velcro instead  sometimes those questions are smart  my son came to me the other day and I asked him Hey go run out to the mailbox and check it  he looked at me  puzzled and said  what is the mailbox just check itself and tell us what does mail as I  has a pretty good question  so they can turn the questions and sometimes we find out we just don't have the right answers we say  son that's just the way the world works so the more were exposed to something  the more we get used to it  but kids haven't been around long enough to get used to those things and so when they run into problems  the true immediately try to solve them and sometimes they find a better way  and that way really is better  so my advice and that we take to heart is to have young people on your team  or people with young minds because if you have those young minds they because everyone in the room to think younger the cost so once said  every child is an artist  the problem is is when he or she grows up is how to remain an artist  we all saw the world more clearly what we saw for the first time  for a lifetime of habits got in the way  our challenge is to get back to their  to feel that frustration to see those little details to look broader look closer  and to think younger  so we can stay beginners it's not easy it requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world  but if we do we can do some pretty amazing things  for me hopefully that's better product design  for you that could mean something else something powerful  our challenge is to wake up each day and say how can I experience the world better  and if we do  maybe just maybe  we can get rid of these dumb little stickers  thank you very much
