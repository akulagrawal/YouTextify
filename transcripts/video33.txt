hi my name is Tom Bergeron and I'm a Google search user experience researcher and the author of lean user research  I'm here to help you ask your customers users and potential customers better questions and get even better answers converse like a talk show host think like a writer understand subtext like a psychiatrist and have an ear like a musician this beautiful thing was said about interviewing people and interviews gathering information through direct dialogue  before you start an interview though ask yourself why before you get into the how to phrase the questions  think about the reason you're there what is it that you're trying to learn  a key aspect of interviewing people is getting familiar with the phenomenon that is called rationalization rationalization is when people when asked about a certain situation that happened in the past fifteen to change reality a little bit to be perceived as good people to be perceived as smart people the example I have for this  is if I ask you %HESITATION would you throw a banana peel on the floor %HESITATION if nobody's looking you would probably say no I don't do that I'm not that kind of a person but given the opportunity to no one is looking two weeks from now you might do that and it's not because you're a bad person it's not because you %HESITATION you don't believe in what you say or you're trying to lie to me you rationalize you want to be perceived as a good person as a helpful person  when you interview people when you ask people questions look for the story this is the most important thing in an interview ask about stories about things that happen ask about behavior for example so in that situation you keep quiet and see what people say better yet if possible asked to observe behavior if you're asking how they read email how they check their email Aston to show you that show me how you do that  ask about perceptions not because you're interested in them but because they will help you again to pull out the stories for example what is the difference between X. and Y. not a very interesting question but it might cause them to remember something about something interesting that happened  the most important thing in an interview is what is something that doesn't look like the most important thing follow up questions these will tell you give you a lot of insight into what really happened why do roll your eyes when you say that what do you mean  why do you call your phone my third arm these are extremely helpful in understanding behavior  a few don'ts  don't ask people about the future three questions product developers tend to ask their interviewees are would you use the product would you pay for it and how much you pay for it these are all very very bad questions why because they ask people to predict the future the problem is people have no idea the even bigger problem is that they think they do have an idea and they answer  another don't is lied about leading the witness  don't insert your opinion into the questions you're asking and then buy a seeing your interview ease into understanding what you're looking for and then give you the answers that you want to maybe don't intimidate if you are stand over the shoulder of someone who's sitting and then ask them a question that is an intimidating body language don't do that that will affect how they answer your your question  don't explain the question shut up and see what happens when you ask a question sometimes their silence from the other side  maybe maybe the person is thinking maybe the person is trying to remember something maybe they don't understand the question  keep quiet your intuition would be to explain the question don't do that just wait a few seconds and see what happens people will fill in the gaps  and finally don't ask for feedback this is another very popular thing up product developers do during interviews they describe the product or show up the product and then ask for feedback if you have the product asked people to use it even if you have a mark of it ask people to use it use a pencil and use it to sum it up here is a little exercise about leading questions I'm going to show you a few questions and let's talk about whether the leading on  first one  would you rather use the current version or this new improved one the word improved is a way for you to insert your opinion and biasing people into the answer that you're looking for  how does this compares to the way Netflix works now  now you're biasing people with their opinions about Netflix good bad you're biasing them into an answer that is not neutral trying to ask about the thing without comparing it to anything else  what did you think about that when you ask that you are forcing people to think about something they might not not have thought about if you didn't ask don't do that  would you click here to log in it's exactly as saying click here to log in this is an extremely biased question  what's wrong with this again inserting your thought that this is wrong and then expecting people to cooperate and say that it's wrong  here are three resources I recommend for learning more about how to ask questions a book an article and a video the book is called interviewing users by Steve particle the article is sixteen interviewing tips by Michael Margolis from Google ventures and the video is what people are really doing by I tease institute of design  here's a quick recap  look for the story  ask about behavior better yet asked to observe behavior  ask follow up questions extremely important  don't ask about the future  don't leave the witness and don't ask for feedback but do ask great questions thank you
