hello how are you  my name is a class  report of the team here and there is a lack of seven people around you  %HESITATION so I hope it's not so much in to be the first time I'm not a musician  so I really don't know about your product except that I sort of %HESITATION and I was very lost  I don't even know how you write music  so you were going to a school so  now and it's very interesting from my point of view  %HESITATION  but we will discuss  but the discussions are I have to follow some process of questions so %HESITATION it's the first time I do these kind of interviews usually I make is directly with clients and face as  %HESITATION so %HESITATION why you participated decided to participate these projects %HESITATION which was initiated by two months right  what was your motivation  yes the thing cost tied up to all the phone so put a bullet meant I started to trip for next school program  also my project until two months later %HESITATION wasn't will fix  well for use of the software project in his song big up must climb  all  I started to suffer projector because I'm an engineer on the list simply curious %HESITATION whole  this colonel so filled with books and I went to trial and if I could to make it work  okay so I see that you have keyboards behind you so your musician as well %HESITATION no so it's a private hobby so  well if you played  yeah okay but you live it you like it really like it and it's so cool sometime a plate in a in a in a couple of bands on some musical soul  %HESITATION years ago  yeah yes ago so I'm still making music the slow fronts so  your product there is a lot of them  they usually  just seeing them in part  so too are you located in in clock yes we are all in Prague here all  see  check friends sure  your from the do not carry out right %HESITATION India  check  Russian and okay as a skinnies  the world is listening  so basically today so you are an engineer and golden to project %HESITATION %HESITATION your musician as well if you don't qualify like that that would say yes a composer right  not really a composer but let's say you're a jazz musician %HESITATION in the sense that %HESITATION all try to improvisations  all music yes  well the consistent so %HESITATION compose up  I don't know my compositions  do you do you find this tool useful today as it is  do you  yes yeah  and the and the  for which reason how how actually you think that to improve it  yeah the %HESITATION the program itself %HESITATION so for me it was finished %HESITATION many years ago and then I tried this proof of concept on this concept work I lost interest in the  stop making this program also let alone I started again on it so basically give the law the positive feedback I get from users worldwide so keep me working on this project  okay so you're very aware day about the the feedback of your customers %HESITATION yes I think so yes  and what is your %HESITATION kind of analysis like a basic %HESITATION five points which actually treat your interest and also %HESITATION to your customers faithful to your tool and expecting more  yeah it's the basic idea tool tool to all work on something useful for the people and and and which I expect that make it to Dave more useful or will be more your school or your customer  yeah also owns every musician every instrument at musicians are playing all requiring a special two months on location  for the developing of this program means all to get it  to make it more useful to more people  that's one one aspect of the next expect expect your working on making it easier to create schools  well known on two sides on one side for beginners to the simple things make simple things even simpler and on the other side to %HESITATION for more professional results for publishers will actually producing all school books with the program although it's a difficult thing I believe  okay for white design tool all two very special features of big enough  you don't understand what the meaning on this for the future of this  all the %HESITATION %HESITATION yeah  a good good question when you open the application ones like in school or playing  that's what  it was like overwhelmed by all these menus last ride on the talk show  I'm not  yeah rex not I'll %HESITATION got some musical someone said try this program even if you're not a musician and even you could kind of treat us because it's just looking interesting %HESITATION  so if it's playing a  and so on so you  just click on the graphic point some  and that some people where %HESITATION enjoying these kind of impression of leading oldest technical arts or it was like a disappointment so I'll how they perceive it  %HESITATION most people %HESITATION lecture program all along to all like the like it because it can produce music in enough possibly and listen to their own music so  it's even more interesting for children are so the school was children world using of this program and that could  compose something so moving notes around on on on the screen went immediately aren't they could listen to the school office  I'm the best they could give it a title also own choice  you mean titling the music  music goes a name okay that's interesting %HESITATION related so that the process of really creating something  okay  so %HESITATION that he's being will belong to them  yeah and it was %HESITATION interaction with several students or just like indeed your in front of each software  all  to the class so I salute children bottlenecks eight twelve years old I guess up sitting in front of a computer up until many computers in the classroom and everyone could  trial  so you witness  I saw a video of the sword was on  okay we can find this video on your trip  yeah maybe I don't know about the %HESITATION Tomas knows this is collecting all this kind of stuff  it is very important to know when we do it's it's interesting to  so what I  we are very oriented the regarding the customer so as much as we know it or the user more exactly %HESITATION as much as we know how much as we can  it's useful for them and %HESITATION making %HESITATION it was successful  so today the application is really a leader on the market right  %HESITATION yeah it's one of the leaders in the market I think %HESITATION because of its for free all of course in a bondage tool the market leaders to noise so the Beatles and phenolic  to be a system %HESITATION from Great Britain munching on is on display United States I think company was doing this  %HESITATION home that would be a new program from Steinberg Germany I guess and  %HESITATION on Christmas day one tool all the ****  so the three programs of the commercial once  new school %HESITATION I think it's so yeah it's one of them okay signature will rank %HESITATION number three  let's say you have  so you are very aware about your  computers ranks is it because of the deadlock mines which are on line and as you I will I will you can predict %HESITATION these information launch %HESITATION yeah more or less it's it's not not %HESITATION my part of the story it's more almost box who wasn't supporting the long lists of the commercial part  I'm interesting of course these programs all Melissa reference products if there's something in question %HESITATION you can look at these programs and we'll call they did it was a soft this kind of problems to use we have  okay so this is very important that you actually pull up the carefully the  the complete teachers and you got do you are you inspired by what they do or are you deciding okay we we knew something original it what is your your kind of decision regarding the developments which feature you %HESITATION oriented your your  %HESITATION improvements yeah first so that's smart decision hold onto sole things up on the sofa part but for future through all be helpful  we could all use a response we have phone up a feature request lists on this kind of stuff under huge forum was slow to reach thousands of entries okay well requesting  so they are voting for the best %HESITATION feature  is that right  yeah wall to solve the  democratic it some way soul someone else to implement it to do it and of the one we implement features decides what he  of course  Hans is so you're going to use to do your laundry how how do you decide like the  which feature would be going %HESITATION for us is because it is easy or  how much it's it's not small not of difficult to explain the technical part in in %HESITATION implementing all this kind of stuff %HESITATION from things are easy to implement some features of the things that were difficult to assess the future was the fit and look clone the structure we have in the Sofia and it's so it's difficult to do %HESITATION then it's likely to be postponed some all  so for those three things it's okay yeah due to implement %HESITATION but difficult in psalm may require a restructuring data structure and so on and the little so slow also for the very expensive phone tall time consuming  it's like you are changing all the basic structures to destroy all the features the group  up to sing you backs and so on make it unstable  okay and %HESITATION what are those features that actually %HESITATION you think they are like the core elements of  use core  and  and this  double or  yeah yeah the goal of a single slot to prove he was so good looking school also that the layout of an immense it's a basic tee off the program %HESITATION organizing oranges on visual elements you see ought it internally in the program in a way to produce one looking all put so though how it's going to stay single for notes  this kind of stuff  all what we are currently doing a song  %HESITATION doing more automatic email team all things you can imagine the Tom some elements in the score can collide if you have or know what had slow buff below the stuff and it collides with slow tempo markings and this kind of stuff  and we are trying to automatically place just moments doing collision detection  this call stuff dishes because your customers asking for it or is it more like a technical aspects which will facilitate the functioning how how what how do you justify these  the simple  because from now on %HESITATION two things first it so it makes the producing the squall easier and faster  of the normal process is that you are a minority adjusting elements and now it's automatic so we can produce scores faster  best looking the schools maybe you which  all this requires some fun to  but %HESITATION good enough looking schools  yeah yeah using of the though core mission isms one of the product for the sophomore one school of you well on smartphones and tablets and %HESITATION on on a technique to be are we we arrange local school off the so that they fit on the screen  this is quite a step to Molson's up  automatically  because this fine tuning a without us up groups only if he's bringing that sale on a for the performance and you are adjusting sings to look right on them fix it before what what on a mobile device  %HESITATION screen size is a different view of me arranging the squall dynamic kindly and have to do all this automatic  so in the end to the whole room I tried to develop along the lease tool of but I'm looking more for a true but I'm looking more by that  two regarding the developers %HESITATION which are participating on the get up how do you structure the team you are leading the decisions  armed  %HESITATION Sloan just wait a few helpful central repository off the source code for the monster loan program  you see it on other people can look at the source code and can at all features by contributing court of this court those are presented as a so called  request for all people  I understand the coke from my point of view because I'm not a deadlock or myself is just a question of the structure how actually when you implemented feature or technology part of the software  how do you justify the development and who is in the team because those are based in the community  %HESITATION do you %HESITATION hello hello hello asus working do you are you does the one which is like the final points saying okay would go for these  and we implemented  %HESITATION  just so I can go it is two people who decide to so it's me and it's %HESITATION Nicholas all I have right to exist to do smarter repositories so can make changes Nicolas can make changes and I believe you have full two or three of the people of developers from the community who can also right off the strip the Tory because you trust them to not make bad since all of  and those people are musician as well  %HESITATION I'm just %HESITATION yeah lay music will create  yes yeah owned this also could pull requests to be a deciding on %HESITATION some from the community %HESITATION some from Nicholas some from need all this is also discussed in the community solo forum open to members yeah three open with so many  development and everybody come come look at it and can all discuss it  so %HESITATION some things are really at all decided to %HESITATION from the community because I'm I'm not this is the bottom users from London can decide to order with the Turks ahead don't have the knowledge to know how to do this  so you need to use the veto the part of the song  you know so development decisions  and there is someone who actually went  and he makes  he doesn't like I mean that was like a moderating this community like sustaining a %HESITATION did not make a  process of development is yes it's not moderated a little it's really open everybody come now can contribute to the discussion %HESITATION but in the in the %HESITATION the decision was made by me %HESITATION Nicholas  simply because I'm the one we have to implement more things and Nicholas thus implementing things  well yeah insist so your trend will be from more the technical point of view more about the future point of view  %HESITATION bos  so some features are easy to implement %HESITATION so it's it's easy to decide on the future of difficult and expensive to implement  well %HESITATION more discussion expensive in terms  right yes no  all these resources are limited of course  you  couples  sorry there is some  it is  we are in the library of the university so it's like  announcements like at the airport  %HESITATION but the the room of work is very nice here  ins  so %HESITATION  I am looking at the the questions here %HESITATION  are you so you the the according to what that we discuss about it before you mentioned that the kids which are like %HESITATION very interested in getting on board very fast and %HESITATION making something  %HESITATION illegal results as they do computer classes at is it related with music as well or how are our a  actually these %HESITATION interaction with the software is happening as it is in our computer classes  it's a wonderful open music lesson some all  okay so they did tend to learn music and in the same time using the the software  you know so %HESITATION yeah they're playing with a soul fulfill some more but %HESITATION two softwares so  very nice to to learn music of course because of the of the immediate feedback you get it through Aug drive down location shoots gets immediate feedback %HESITATION Levick  and how the teacher is %HESITATION actually %HESITATION how do we know this software how he actually interviews the software just kids you know about it no more would you %HESITATION also in the special thing about this is so the the age of the children arm normally your arm if you're in a music school so you would think of this kind of program  program so they are about twenty Ole Ole  at the time in really read music schools windows putting down all but about  home this just kind of people are because you learn on this call mostly  so there was this part of creativity %HESITATION we have the four  where we work we would like to know what it is it's about the variation %HESITATION that you are about to release the next year and as you are like this technical person which is having decisions  the implementation of the features  %HESITATION  do you think that %HESITATION actually are there is a way to implement song are  haven't you weeks or interface with in the process of rationing  before the  make the final release of the version three  or if you have a expectation to work with the unix that will will double up afterwards  to understand right tool %HESITATION boom the development of for you all right  yeah %HESITATION  I  sellers so how do you see your action within the process of development  yeah there too two Bucks first home grown the Wiest's all strongly coupled into the in the mission itself the program that was very hard to change if you see from a design point the whole so it's not the psalm changeable %HESITATION it's very expensive to change that's the basic you why entering notes look the the note entry more to have  cool all the keyboard to the malls actions if your %HESITATION your moving in men's Roland on this graphical all come us  %HESITATION next to the sauce from you I elements or which operate to synthesize all of those so configuration of the program all editing a star is and and this kind of stuff all the psalm so much easier to change  %HESITATION let's see one awful W. why the Nancy cone behalf of I don't like it so the mixer  it's in the median XL bed was CEO a little four slides and not slow to change the volume off for every instruments in your score  well this is so cool internal mechanics %HESITATION and I'm responsible for implementing the saw misconduct hold this could work to do so the look and feel of the interface saw yeah it's completely arbitrary  currently  and %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION  so you you follow very well the the user feedback as you said at the beginning %HESITATION the the day satisfaction  and %HESITATION  do you for a new look a fuse a few call home feature across from your votes for the %HESITATION what to what to do with salt of the software I'm interesting in though in though let's call the virtual representing if someone's also won this all that future it's not interesting but it's of the user experience %HESITATION why he wants to %HESITATION hefty's future on and the context it is you was armed then you get a better feeling how to implement it  also  %HESITATION sometimes it's not good to Oscar he was also a whole the one to see this or that future implementors  all  to own it at some point you have to make it all  yeah I do have to make  work until  explain all my English is not the best %HESITATION %HESITATION someone %HESITATION sometimes there are conflicts  so if you implement one feature you destroy another future %HESITATION of two features do not fit together come out implement both  although a conflict since implementation  it's from the  from the technical point of view or enough of the technical point of view with soul from the dementor Asian  %HESITATION sometime song  %HESITATION  you also develop us you see all ordered the special cases on normal use that does not see a normal user doesn't see his single problem  it's a developer you have to make it conflict freebies or special cases which are %HESITATION a call  but I want only the simple of future inserting an old and shifting or north to the rights and the mental %HESITATION say mom but what should happen if the goal is to plug on a can of movies over a bottle of wine or the special cases  %HESITATION  yeah how would you see the collaboration between %HESITATION %HESITATION I will research the results of the research and your technical expertise  regarding the development day you are in the process of implementing on the database  how how  do you actually %HESITATION  she  this collaboration  the collaboration this with the re charging the result that we're going to do in order to %HESITATION closer you weeks  with you and with the other stakeholder  yes so %HESITATION I'm grateful for everything put it all on them from let's say you're from all  design perspective flow hole you see the service so you I program on how you want to sort of put on  it's it's my program us only a limited service also some hole so I'm completely free you all will sings a done looked all or  all too well  %HESITATION %HESITATION things change the more this  if you  okay  some people something so it's easier to change of things the more difficult to change didn't know having  you are mentioning the fact of changing but in practice %HESITATION our intention is to make an evolution and an adaptation so %HESITATION our interest or I will collaboration is about trying to implement a better experience from the user according to the data and the information that you have  so %HESITATION  %HESITATION  we want to know actually the actual way to process which is happening with one side your user  knowledge and on the other side the devil Chris capacity which is representing by you so  the question is really importance because it gives you know %HESITATION Scoble how  the freedom or the the way you actually decide on the process of implementing the ex is a very precise questions are how you see the collaboration  %HESITATION saying we can change everything is very  large and it doesn't  hello selection process reduces I will repeat the question because in a formal way you have a lot of constraints and we need to know is constraints in a more detailed way  maybe we can repeat the question in a time %HESITATION but will be coming out  if we go for research that will not be possible to implement I placed  and in terms of not change but an evolution  do you think that it's about adding features do you think that this is about  %HESITATION  less features but implementing them progressively  how a house like  the %HESITATION  six process of implementing new  evolution in the actual %HESITATION  products gone me next year  %HESITATION yeah %HESITATION  %HESITATION Michael install tool %HESITATION reduce future smallest would really like to reduce future as well in the sense that I want to make a  Altman R. O. feature set oh sure adults to use our  %HESITATION %HESITATION things he wants to do with the purpose of %HESITATION would be to at special features fall special needs and adding one more one more  earned my believe us sol %HESITATION the less stressful future of the program house you tool tool %HESITATION tool easier it is to use  so every very special feature for coal you the Arbil  we could use over the long haul so usability fall for normal use a small as well  that's that's difficult to war tool also not say to political us on one's a pragmatic approach and that's a special problem  at a special button to solve this problem of that so let's say you're though denials Philadelphia all through the program can only make things of a trip to slow descent which is designed in of though unix Kotak I can from the unix so it  up to provide a subtle force more towards roots can be combined some whole  in the end you can make sense of the program but just not all designed in from the beginning  so it's more flexible and all and so on  %HESITATION though implementation is based on this automotive settle future three half so if the feature requests from also add to all change requests we want to change something and it fits into this autopen on sept all features which is implemented then it's easy to do but if it does not fit done it's a problem  you'll have to change it you know control flow flows so filled them  bill get complicated  so there is two fellows of fear mongers chat  if I understand what you mentioned before there's two philosophy in the way they are Nicola and %HESITATION you are actually collaborating even though it's the same product and the technical  our background is different so therefore you change  %HESITATION %HESITATION no features are different priorities  how does it work %HESITATION between you and Nikola  maybe on mall  %HESITATION exaggerating a little bit this problem all but in the end home or do you do with so to confirm this  all the compliments sol because of the limited resources we often  so %HESITATION mostly a pragmatic approaches saw required to do things  people to do something the slopes of software  in two do you have a already plans older different features that going to be implemented aggression three or is still a flexible process how  %HESITATION process for me also  %HESITATION for me you know some more or less so continuous development of the product by adding new features and %HESITATION %HESITATION if I have to implement a future withdrew because some  change of the inner workings of the program the new Bill  last long well  get back to a more stable version  your country is also in the end he believes this is version three dot goal  there is a specific reason how how how is the evolution is that like  three suddenly in three weeks there is like two three developers supervised by you which I like implementing %HESITATION new features and then sent me one months %HESITATION wait for something bad or  structure regarding the solution  the engine three  nope this glorious start  so %HESITATION  well we have some %HESITATION project system all this a defined goal which %HESITATION %HESITATION were implemented by someone else earned more finished  for instance although good some of the project we did this young auto three students all cool implemented some special features  so they made a proposal %HESITATION multiple to do on this proposal was discussed in the community earns a thought developing %HESITATION does not finished on most things or work sold Saul is gone for good you make all the growth  I don't know there's this big red design soccer we have gone to you both automatic placement model for women's school %HESITATION yeah it's just so cool feature %HESITATION flew off the next big Russian  to the students Isshin as well  %HESITATION I'm not necessarily %HESITATION model I believe  or maybe will be most essence what's gonna  so for us to have to be %HESITATION see plus plus program all schools  yes %HESITATION discrimination %HESITATION for a musician %HESITATION program %HESITATION so  well this well combination  okay  %HESITATION yes one contributor lists all just **** to mark's about to the phones and welcome to states all new %HESITATION does really all program in see plus plus  all  can program works but it's an exception  do you communicate a lot about your products of manga musician or more in the community tool developers which  actually you have  what is interesting is to know how you get the feedback and from who is it more from the users like from the position or is there something that low purse which are actually suggesting features and would work on me I have a hard time to understand the way you manage this community on one side the musicians are on the devil curbside  can you explain me yes %HESITATION both %HESITATION people who are active on the forums musicians or hoping magicians all %HESITATION single switching in in the core  this kind of stuff  %HESITATION musicians and some people all actually producing and publishing the schools with the program  you are so  sorting these communities yeah those of some of the soul be musicians so %HESITATION it's wall contributing court so but not that much people  so %HESITATION yeah  okay so all  well we can have these data later %HESITATION will use is %HESITATION  so it's it's a little not feedback from program a small school  how do you see a  %HESITATION successful %HESITATION shin tree like to increase your audience or is it %HESITATION to target but %HESITATION your audience or to fool Christians some part of your audience  yes the flu kind of thinking is more Thomas like  so I'll go in and do use H. of of the of the application yeah  but it's not the buys my thinking was thinking it's it's an interesting technical problem  I tried to sort of  okay so this technical challenges yes yes yeah okay working wrists %HESITATION busier costs %HESITATION to %HESITATION to get the old lan and collision detection for busy across both the next things or try to take a  okay  so in thinking willful use us and making though the order so you also confirm your reaching with this product %HESITATION begun and so on did the deadlock or community you follow the most do you yeah I'm %HESITATION I'm over in this list of bug reports you have fear for many many many old book reports on future Chris or this kind of stuff yes  tell you every day you actually do you do you'll every day %HESITATION go for what's going on today at the  community or every week it's a regular %HESITATION process war  so I'm I'm not fooling the community on a retro law basis %HESITATION locked in a systematic way all Nicholas this expected this I believe is foreign community you very closely so present in the chat rooms and %HESITATION does most of the communication  unity even on the technical point of view and the users point of view  yes yeah so it's one of my my post %HESITATION deficiency all do not communicate enough on so maybe I'll  autistic or whatever  well if you like mathematics is for  %HESITATION yes we almost %HESITATION ending their interview and we'll have  questions people and yet sometimes %HESITATION  so %HESITATION  it's very interesting your point of view up  so the version three you would see the success from a technical point of view making the %HESITATION application most simple or every  that's more sophisticated forward so it's more so  %HESITATION yeah makes the best program available all of it  be one of my in my in my goals  and do you do you see some problem that you're going to actually %HESITATION soul not be an aberration tree  a major %HESITATION  you shoot at the extreme you have seen progressing from version one from the searching to actually depression tree clicked %HESITATION chief for the future distance big goal of for automatic placement of elements and collision detection you did not help version two currently  you have already feedback from people who will try to actually uses version three %HESITATION  all very positive feedback from people would like it to what's going on so you are testing %HESITATION %HESITATION I'll stop there shin regarding these yeah also %HESITATION if you'd like you can mount can see every day progressed so by using the nightly build up of producing will ever change I do on a daily basis law %HESITATION  %HESITATION gets in to the latest conversion  and everybody controlled  so daily in date gumballs on a daily basis all be how from all ocean for windows users for unix most you have to go but it just sort of put %HESITATION also for mac users the booking  controlled  okay  all  %HESITATION synchronized with the fact that they will be on different devices as you mentioned before  yes yeah  and it  most of the users are using the version on this dog one on the hand held the more bile or  what's more  so for creating school  home the musical programmers also used on the desktop  and for playback call for user on this kind of stuff so all you do some water that way you can get schools  okay SO three cheese forty five minutes there will be %HESITATION open questions from the attendance here %HESITATION I think ideas and or go through all the questions once simple stratosphere  I I will be there and then  so when we could rotate %HESITATION if you don't have any questions  so thank you man at  the  he's going to ask which yes we do not  so I'm just gonna let nine the others %HESITATION ask questions and then I'm gonna have some questions my own and wrap up  so  yeah so that's going to strictly having she  no  computer  okay  have any  I'm thinking about  yeah you can  I have one question my name under  so in you mention you have some core features you want to wait them understand right you want some questions just  the main disco  right  user can use futures and add them  a week about their goal is yes the desktop phone new school all all program  so yeah  all  I don't think I understand what what would you want to see that it desktop program  you said there are so many features you won't  you want to use them as well like delete them all  yeah known actually don't want to do you delete the future up all I mean I want to %HESITATION minimize the to the %HESITATION to you all right more this tool  by future a if you're single awful  able to produce some kind of full school also all would reduce this  but just to be able to produce  kind of course I want to do this because the minimal set off for of buttons and  %HESITATION  it would be even better if you saw who you are a could be reduced to some simple not too few of concepts  well into the condo some concert told to you to use so you are and if you  be able to reduce the number of call  to be easier to amend a true %HESITATION  for normal guy tool %HESITATION appraisal fell it's easier to memorize all things will work whole  someone could to chief of special effect  all too many people %HESITATION cannot find hold hold to do this to do lead to measure all something like that all  %HESITATION  I believe for all if in the background there are very few will offer concepts it would be easier to operate to stock up on the th of some jerk so kind of for you why design I want to think about  well not a ball hold call buttons but how many buttons and are they really necessary can this be made different and easy out  that's what I mean by reducing futures  what  thank  okay  it will  %HESITATION right now  warm  all right so I have a few questions are asked and then I'll wrap up  first I want to ask about your expectations what do you expect from this design  %HESITATION  yeah better user experience for a full for you the  and it's it's really difficult ought to rule on because we have this this broad range of views of all  starting from from children  hello  playing with the flow of the program  show want to have some positive feedback on the low side view how flow of professional musicians withdrawal sometimes computer illiterate  and our job sometimes all I lost some old  the devoted to something  people who are looking for a button to or did you just call from the computer out the whole can ideally I can create a school that's it but I cannot do needed for how can I do this and you have to explain them all use your operating system and financial to do this also Sophia  this kind of stuff  and  what kind of school do you imagine us to target well %HESITATION do you expect us to %HESITATION  well what what would you expect what what how would you define the scope  %HESITATION efforts  yeah tool all  %HESITATION  I don't know we are you what do I need to know you have to define this so that's what you want to put on it %HESITATION what you want to talk to chief so are there any restrictions  hello  no  also restrictions of course  okay  is there a  is there something that that you prefer us not to focus on  %HESITATION %HESITATION  okay  all right so we can focus on anything it's it's very open and I'll discuss %HESITATION  I understand correctly what is your greatest fear of %HESITATION design effort failing  what are you most concerned about  about the design  yeah if you try to change %HESITATION though  yeah well to all the if you try to do to change the underlying concept  he was then it sort of getting difficult for me  %HESITATION well what do you mean by and rally underlying concepts %HESITATION  yeah also all that's hard to do %HESITATION  to explain all  let's say you know what the input mode behalf so what if it's a more or if you want to introduce more molds or  we moved to smote all done it's it's difficult to rule  it is are you concerned because of the implementation issues or is there another reason why you're concerned more about women Tatian assurance and of the the whole thing is complex and %HESITATION I I see problems with your change of this kind of stuff on yeah %HESITATION I believe all the things we don't work anymore them so  good solution no doubt level  what would you  I would like to me he %HESITATION make sure  about this question which is about dose if you have five key element that actually you could be a problem could you name them or describe them that could be actually I'm structuring the software which actually some dealers of the software what are they  no I can name them  totally also  maybe one  %HESITATION  so it's a little bit upstart I think all  the whole  so %HESITATION  no I don't know external okay let me maybe there no restrictions so often which can be changed  %HESITATION  just  I would like you to think about it you should have some idea about this because this is for me I think quite important to think about  %HESITATION because you mentioned them and then now it's like a  and the fine and it's the one aspects which can drive our development in one way or another I think there are going to be technical restrictions and if you burning and  and the %HESITATION then that's fine all right now I think we'll run into them when you design  think of anything though %HESITATION  we appreciate hearing hearing it has %HESITATION  if so if you're looking to fill %HESITATION thank you have a better way to do things all the other can discuss system refined audited saw global or not thank  yeah well always community you will  how how do you expect us to communicate how often would you like to communicate and how much  as much as slow necessary %HESITATION but it's completely open source all the I used to %HESITATION make this development completely open to all discussions of a public moreless  how involved would you like to be in the process are as little as possible okay  we don't want to make any any decision all of the design and end of the final thing  I believe  if I were a design I would design it and we're going to ask you about this %HESITATION I want to delegate this tool people normal  doing and I like people can work all  %HESITATION what's cordial self contained some old school  %HESITATION much controllable to  all right  would you like us to focus on what what do you see this as a focus  all you have to call the house will solve this  the song this mix up problem all I don't know a whole two strokes is currently all the mics also simplifies up and the and and and all this stuff owns all bindles frequently have to operate so frail  is %HESITATION is their work will or %HESITATION AT is your is  search for  doesn't make it  like it's  all the connection is that I didn't get the last sentence %HESITATION  basically what what do you see as problematic areas  or %HESITATION people that aren't being targeted that should be targeted  the target also from  I think I'm on the wrong person to also school I'm I'm this technical guy who doesn't condition %HESITATION %HESITATION if you books that I'm I'm happy  but it's more for for all the people I think okay for for for the users %HESITATION my technical problem of the P. R. contra using all the support Tyler was hassle fifty fold lines of code I want to drop it by the stem of Thailand Nicholas Dustin this is the last day is I'm  awful when  I'm sorry I I didn't hear you are did you say Nicholas doesn't want to the class implemented this already and also you can look up to the more this good install of so could we are using  end of year are open to all the salt Steinmetz  you can modify the look and feel awful for many elements from the outside but scripting without recompiling the sofa  also to experiment lives look and feel owned up yell for me most in the office of  basic style look very oddly  but that's nothing to %HESITATION toward to discuss so  my likings or not I like to doc's son Nicholas lex Luthor lifestyle and the people say darkstar was depressing and awful and  yeah  kind of these discussions are  yeah yeah okay you mentioned argued audience %HESITATION you mentioned that there is a large scope of people using this %HESITATION children from children to professionals islands you music beginners %HESITATION  what do you see as a focus %HESITATION user target target user issues %HESITATION saw %HESITATION student to music school I think  what is the question to %HESITATION to ought to to muscle  is there a person that you feel like specifically doesn't fit %HESITATION  zero it is there a person that you were specifically not targeting %HESITATION okay  Thomas Thomas of god and then %HESITATION actually people  writing music or improvising on a target user and %HESITATION the people who have to those already that it's it's more of a tool or %HESITATION writing the music down rather than composition  yeah yeah would develop a point of view %HESITATION I would like to more support all composers to add more features to make composing easier okay which is going to leave the country all small fault job producing scores for yup  do you %HESITATION  would you like and you score to be more focused on composing composition or markers on %HESITATION no notation on a school writing or writer writing the music down  yeah it's it's full body music dawn the look the main reason reduces project fire but by easing compositional become law get people who call use all unknown to all people to write down delta compositions of both first using this call for this  the benefits would be %HESITATION Kanab can listen to your compositions immediately and all come in all sorts of insulin  four normally your using and Jennifer this panel canceling people  going forward well what do you see as your main focuses with music or in general  my wife was on misquote  I know the focus of the %HESITATION projects  how do you how do you expect the ball  yeah %HESITATION what we're doing is some more ending up so it's a professional thought school are getting more proficient symbolic will  use the school  so all  yeah  ease of use for beginners %HESITATION and to extend a loss like it's sort of difficult to do built over the salute both suck moreless okay  I need you expect those to ship more towards %HESITATION  digital display of of scores verses currently there is a more of a focus on on printed scores  all those calls  the  if you had to choose between %HESITATION  quick delivery and sorrow  throw design %HESITATION process what would you choose what was more important to you  the darkness or a speed  well the little girl was okay  how do you how do you see what do you see as the role of Adam's going forward  well well you mean so you mentioned  thank you you preferred to have a very unique base give thanks Adams on to play a more major part going forward  for special needs  you know this could happen if this melodic approached by  raising more muted future storm role and also plugins all  no  okay  well what do you see as as the biggest hurdles that you had %HESITATION in terms of design and user experience  all  I personally don't have any problems with some of the design for mere if it's working it's okay let's see other people have for many problems design  but  yeah it's it's %HESITATION it's something %HESITATION if there's some old people see this product  give them a  some people see it as a toy  that's something which saw its not so  %HESITATION reusable relief of because of the clumsy you look and feel  all the both the first version be how to log in log bindle slutty five location  so all Texas law  for you the three programs the toilet so the look and feel decides whole professional  this program  the little three year functionality the program us it's really important  there's so  I guess one last question ideally where would you expect to see the project in five years  that's a good question  %HESITATION  yeah %HESITATION it'll be better than love the market leaders currently  okay  that's a goal from the group put of to day and better in what ways  yeah this is up to a year about a half full but I features but a disability %HESITATION easier to you with all the corn market  okay  want to have some commercial success of course so you know maybe  I commercial success as in our own making money  yes  okay are there that  are there any plans to make more money %HESITATION well what are the current plans of of %HESITATION making money from you all yes grow the userbase  okay  %HESITATION anyone have any questions  okay  do you know the the competitors rights do you owe me a little bit so I'm not using the vehicle selector are you using them laurel never the  I started with the Beatles was an old version of the Beatles I bought three for  six hundred %HESITATION will be back at the time  %HESITATION CBS five hundred both soup to put a type of the product of the law I get some inspiration with this program  books  but then I never upgraded to and I don't have any fee not installed or go  I don't even have any windows computer at home  so this is  yeah and their inspiration was because the technical part of you is was easier to use or  well no it was a starting point %HESITATION four of them show up medical something riches slot at school but all of them deals  because at the time of the best program available the most modern program %HESITATION from from from %HESITATION so for design  all you will see a reference for me  jock  I'm gonna maybe %HESITATION room  repeat one one aspects which for me is I think it is important that you know %HESITATION  you mentioned that you would love to have these products or at least you would like to have these products local composer so they can create and not only writing this course is it the way I understand it  local composers let's see special features so to all of which Los  although the finished product in the more or  in terms of radio difficult to explain all the composer you start with the Middle melody line and you don't have any measures and don't have fall district requirements squall S. to start with a little new at this kind of stuff  composer wants to duplicate  %HESITATION seconds of notes from one instrument to a different instruments %HESITATION more refined it in a special way  %HESITATION to break up controlled into several instruments and this kind of features so you don't need to fuel the simple right don't wanna mom existing piece of music  %HESITATION but if you all %HESITATION composing for let's see it orchestra you'll constantly need this functionality  should show you your today you feel that's it  it fits your needs or you would like to have I mean personally and as a musician or as a composer as a jazz musician you feel at this location is satisfying your needs or you still think that %HESITATION there is missing beasts and that  how do you feel is the main %HESITATION  are you part of the Stargate group that you were mentioning  which %HESITATION  %HESITATION from the whole music %HESITATION listed in list some functionality arm  so you want to transcribe the music you will grow up playing a free  just just musician river water project owns the score the so very difficult because saw ohm  this call was an obstruction of full review music  played by musician what the exact timing %HESITATION you play the notes can be written Dahlem  so the obstruction is to simply far or this  on a bottle  %HESITATION future through make this also simpler  we have gone to the song and and the needy in port section of your play an instrument instrument of let's say you've gone on record to somebody recording and put it into a new school arm there are some club also fell which underlies this media %HESITATION fired and tries to fun olds of the main beach and all this stuff to make readable notation over to  okay %HESITATION  more features so calm necessary tool to make this easier  okay Susie if we can  more information by your guarding this  we'll be asleep  or  what you are you are the more precise where you're talking about these media and %HESITATION systems which are most simple that you feel be translated in features so therefore %HESITATION  what our vision of the simplification that you have we need to and  standard be more  but that's the going to the I mean %HESITATION  you have a great day here and this like timelines for some people here so I ended up  so I basically %HESITATION  it was nice talking to you  I feel like we learned a lot about %HESITATION  how you perceive the soccer we're going to have a right up soon %HESITATION  and we'd like to stay in touch so are hopefully will do a lot more things publicly  going forward %HESITATION  the next phase is probably going to be use research when we talk to people and try to find %HESITATION their work flow how they think about %HESITATION  certain things %HESITATION  yeah how you score could send what their goals are etcetera %HESITATION and hopefully we'll do that in an open way and %HESITATION use the community as much as possible  if you have ideas on how to use the community for user research that he appreciated the others so a lot of information birds deep into though  into the war database you could be half the forum so all your  okay little discussions we had in the past  okay maybe  I'll take a look  do you have anything you'd like to add  %HESITATION  okay  then I think that's that's all  I will  yeah I'll keep in touch using email okay  okay I'll see you later then
