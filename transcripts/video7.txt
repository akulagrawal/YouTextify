hi everyone how you will  great such a wonderful crab thank you so much for all coming to my told today say my name is Jenny guy and I'm a user experience reset check here it giggle I've been a good go now this month but ten years and I heard that that Kevin sites thank you  I had that that can side with that the number of years we've been having I at conferences say %HESITATION at Dublin eventually that's really fun said this afternoon we're gonna be talking about developing great  and creating %HESITATION principles of mobile app design that I want to share with you so that you can create great experiences for your users  I'm why is this important well it's important because there are a sorry there are over one point five million apps in each of the axles as we knows that there's a lot of concentrate better does a lot of competition out that and you don't want your to suffer from usability florals I think usability floor than user experience issues can contribute to the lack of engagement that some apps have so for example we plan that things like twenty five percent of apps sometimes and get use more than once and that thirty four percent about on paper more than eleven times said that these these statistics that are around with regard to you know asking gauge meant to me engagement with doing a lot of work on that issue itself at Google %HESITATION with certain products that by bringing out but I think it's also want us to like reading  why cannot you know user experience on all our usability issues and not  so I'm gonna tell you about three things and the rest of my talk I'm gonna tell you a story about an experience I had with the not recently I'm gonna tell you about a study that we ran to understand what makes a really great experience and I'm going to go through some of the principles that we have published online so that you can understand some key things that you can do to make you laugh expense bad I mean then those principles I've got a number of resources for you as well that can help you along the way  so my story while I was on vacation with my family here we are we having a wonderful time in Florida that's me and my my partner my kids and before we went on vacation idea setup a series of hotels for us to stay at it was a south driving tool and I pre book these I did that on my laptop  when I got to Florida I found that a lot of hotels and started using the making use great use of that new technologies I specifically in order to give me somebody famous experiences on my check  they do things now like enabling me to check it before I get that's it just like I can for a plane on enabling me to go straight up to my room in order to open the door just with the act that's pretty cool I was pretty blown away by these new things that they were able to do  but %HESITATION what happened when I was on vacation was the notification to check in came out I was standing in line at  something like this in the roller coaster at the theme park asked me did I want to check in and they also asked me did I want to choose my own room or did I want to let them choose for me welcome back when I booked I remember there was a I went there was a text field and asked me if I'd go any requests and I put in the I wanted to have a city view because I knew at the next hotel there was this beautiful pristine beach I ordered a remake the balcony and I really wanted this wonderful experience looking out over the state but I didn't know whether that ex you know experience on the laptop which translates into this experience that I was now faced with that was a bit concerned about that and you know I thought that I might have a better opportunity of cheese in my M. the mother than letting them choose for me kind of always better to take into your right hand side so I decided to change my name and the experience that they gave me was pretty good on a mobile device actually wet Sunday this looks like it would be quite challenging in terms of in the state but it went quite well they clearly laid out the different rooms and they clearly labeled whether the rooms were taken or open it with anyone problem that and that was I have no idea which way the sea with faces you know which way the hotel was pacing in front of the sea  so  I was a nine and trying to figure out how to how I could so Vance now the west %HESITATION what commands that I did not she thing called at the time things like I'm getting to the Congo Max maybe I could figure it out or looking on Google images in this case the hotel's father symmetrical  five it would be quite tricky I decided to use a kind of rule of thumb %HESITATION give a stick and I decided to  I think that the side with the message taken rooms was probably decide that west facing messy  so I decided to cheese room seven hundred and thirty over here so we got to the hotel took up all the banks you know what's going to happen that you  I got a view that looked  right there  big disappointment you know so what did I have to the then what I have to then go all the way down again service sector much I thought I'd buy policy by using that %HESITATION taught to the receptionist they were extremely helpful lovely hotel fixed it for me and in the end we went back up the different floral meant in the hotel and I got a few that was much more like this beautiful hi this is Ashley Florida it looks like the Bahamas or something was really really nice  so the end hacen guest service was required human intervention was required because the I hadn't really did it if the service I typed it worked it done so well I was really taken with this new technology I could Jeez but it fell short back has it hadn't delivered this critical piece of information for me which was you know I just needed some information on the map in this case I just needed a view of the ocean packs a few weights I just needed some orientation  so for me it was pretty critical that my view was all of this beautiful beach rather  then this call call and you know it could have been even more critical than mine you know very M. did to me vacation it could obtain an event manager booking for a client perhaps it could have been people booking for guests for a wedding or something  what I said is there and that's how we as developers and designers really need to understand the whole flow that I use as a going through I'm where that breaks down this it's been really cool new technology but I'd have to sort of backtrack through the whole thing and do those things that the act was supposedly saving me from doing so really understanding that experience from beginning to end and I think a mobile it's really those little things that we we don't realize we need to cover and so that's why we really and the need to understand the user's perspective and the users experience with that  so my talk is gonna be about things like that and how we can fix them let me give you a little history  I have years ago we found that a lot of experiences on the mobile web or particularly problematic for people and so we conducted a large study and try to understand where things one being implemented right for the mobile when and where we could do better and we release this after twenty five principles for the mobile web those of them made the wow people have used them as a kind of initial step in making a good foray into providing a better user experience on the mobile web  but asks as well as those of done we've had people come back to us and said this is great for the mobile web but my app what about my apple you  can you tell me about my son had lots of polls to do another study and the study are not so that's what we've done more recently we've looked at a native and a study and said the principles I'm going to present to you today are the result of that wet  so in this study we've been able to understand patents that lead to poor user experience says and then luckily Anne and I hopefully we were able to see where some companies have implemented things in a better way and understand why those plans what better and bring those to you as well and it is important to us for us to really understand this well say that %HESITATION we can be confident in the principles that were telling you about and you can be confident in implementing them in your own products  so in order to do the study we partnered with a company called onsite lab that we use our experience consultancy based in San Francisco me partnered with them because they could help us scale because we wanted that study to be pretty large scale  we studied interaction on a hundred different apps on may about said these ranged from large retailers through to smaller service providers we looked at news that we looked at many different sorts of services like great to be services travel services %HESITATION retail small I'm big companies we didn't look at games as part of this and that was on purpose because we felt that would weaken or dilute the principles %HESITATION within games probably have a whole different set of principles so am aside from that we we looked across a wide range  your ****  I'm we can set the base that is in San Francisco and Chicago and New York City  now that well a hundred new three participants that took part in this study say for usability study that's really big  they came into the lab individually each for ninety minutes said that makes a hundred and fifty five hours of usability studies say if you stayed up all night and all day that would be almost a week with no breaks or you know in reality it's more like %HESITATION mice full weeks of of %HESITATION working weeks  set at a large that indeed and not say that we could cover these different verticals  what did we do in the study well people came into the study and during the ninety minutes they were able to use around six apps visit you know really getting into some good toss for each of those they brought in that room friends with them and that was because we wanted them to be really familiar with the fair and we didn't want any problems because it was a different device so they went used to the back button or anything like that so we had about fifty percent on android I'm fifty percent on iOS  and then what did we do when they're when the study so we had a friend costs and different scenarios set up for them and we did our best to make that Thomas kind of mean something to them as well so that they couldn't do what we call satisficing which is just kind of doing that tossed as as soon as I can and and and as quick away as they can we wanted them to care about the task  so we often talk to them about things that they had about in this example we might talk to them about their favorite food and understand what it is from them fast before then going to ask them to see if they could order it for dinner that evening and we had them speak out loud using what's called in use of usability terminology think about protocol we did that say that we could understand the pain points that day hit as they were going through the different toss that they were doing and we could understand where things flowed really smoothly full of them  so having done that we took the data that was a lot of data which you can imagine from that match usability material I'm we've collected it down to twenty five principles said that this is something that you can take can understand and apply to your own  we've categorized the principles into six chapters but before I go into them I want to explain that how we actually got to these twenty fine so in order to make it into the twenty five principles we have to see that this was a problem across the Ryan white range of fascicles and that we had just see that it was a fairly common problem we did encounter more things in twenty five things that were problematic in apps but we wanted to make sure that we were hitting the biggest problems and that we all say so better ways that these could be implemented  okay so the different chapters that we have %HESITATION around navigation and exploration  an access  comments and conventions  registration  former entry  and usability and comprehension  now  we've got twenty five of these different principles but having this talk I'm just gonna go into two principals from each of the truck says and the rest of the principles of available to you online I've also pull together some resources for you that can help with the implementation of some of the things you see here and that might be a good time to take a picture of the screen as is if it's a loss that you can look into in your own time in more detail  okay said that starts off with navigation and exploration said this chapter is really about guiding use as to the content that they're looking for quickly so we put together a set of key principles to help you create effective and delightful navigation so that's take a look at some of these now  so a feature that can be really of great how to use as is or type detection of location  but don't assume that that location based task is necessarily based in that current location without exception I think we saw this too often so it's a really great thing to be out to implement and help you know face a seamless experience for users when they want something that's located where they are but basically we store it over a pride without a way of enabling people to change application so in this example somebody's looking for a hotel tonight and then looking up for her time there where they %HESITATION  and %HESITATION unfortunately while they can change the location and the any  there is probably guys three settings I'm we saw this problem in not only travel apps but we saw it also may be to Allah we still use cases of people wanting to find something in a store %HESITATION but that perhaps was located name whether parents live and they wanted to figure out you know if it was in the store near them said that they could tell my parents about not  %HESITATION so it just it just %HESITATION only providing this week basically be missing too many use cases that were outside of the tsunami and in travel we saw at my people would turn up for the transportation and the hotel that they wanted to but was at the other end to the other end of the train line and they have time now to book the hotel but then %HESITATION in that place where that %HESITATION wet then needing the hotel at the time let much medicine now yeah is distilling able people to use a common location but to provide %HESITATION the results for them to change that well so basically great great so that you know technology here that you definitely encourage you to use but it's kind of ever applied without using some of the screen in the state to enable them to change location  if you do want to use the auto detecting location then Google places API enables you to discover that have any supported location I'm we've got a show and be that to get to that material  so another aspect of navigation and exploration that we saw a fair bit with  is %HESITATION moving people from that to the mobile web and you can see in the way I've written this principle that you know that I have all issue  with the message that's why I'm so wet conditions the needed so where they are needed make non fiction last so I think the idea I have is you know  are they really needed in each case for doing it which trying here at Google to make technologies to make this a lot smoother this transition way you need to do it but you know at the moment we still see at least some sort of performance hit so many consider what you whether you have to push people out to the mobile web when that in Iraq to experience right now and then make them friction last say in this example we've got somebody he's checking in for a flight this can be a quite usual situation where people %HESITATION I moved out to the mobile web but what we often solo and not not just in trouble that's another tsunami is is well we so the experience changed fundamentally so we saw something like this  okay and it can sometimes happen I think because of the organizational structure of teams you know this is the act team and this is the mobile web team and they haven't been token enough  %HESITATION so I think you know companies some companies are doing a better job of bringing these teams together say enable them to plan the user experience the look come fail and how how content is laid out and and then separating out for the actual implementation on different platforms so and much better experiences when companies have been really thoughtful about this and you can make that look and feel very seamless even though you're just moving out you know right out to the mobile when  on android with doing some work on this and we've got some technology co crime  stem taps it you should look into it's very helpful for enabling you to do things like changing the toolbar Kyla and exit and enter animations to make the whole process of moving from that to the mobile web mostly nice  moving on to the second at chapter here so the importance of great an upset with the company and the estimated so that's talk about a couple of crucial such implementations  so how many did displaying the sat failed we found is that when we did and the mobile web study about the importance of that  so on the poor example we have set in a place where people expect to look for it but it's not how they expect to find it as as as as a text a piece of text ten what we saw in the study was people kind of did have some frustration looking around the set sometimes it was hidden under a menu %HESITATION and they found one of the most obvious things but I think what I ate my summary of what I saw in the study was that %HESITATION  developers and designers on implementing %HESITATION like consistent such assistance that failed enough %HESITATION we advise at this distance such food should be included when such as a really quite significant part of your experience in Europe I think what's happening is plenty of people that thinking that set is important but not that important to debate the screen where the state save so I'm you know check that out and you know I am you know should you be giving it more prominence and you currently on  so we have a vice on this it material design and we have  at this distance that's putting and sat photo may also have expandable such %HESITATION where we had the Looking Glass icon that that can be expanded for such of course think about the prominence of such in your eye and how much it really matters to people when you're making that decision about which type of set she should implement  and then for implementation details we have the sets dialogue on the sets which it and this link will take you to more information about that  what about fell to and sort options hugely important again we often so that they were hidden old also to buy rate of five the damn people couldn't get to them as much as they needed that's what I'll study that we just did recently showed you know we did see great implementations of it but still that's more what to be done things like getting down to two hundred and forty two results for a shot with no way to kind of fell to assault them fathom so a better implementation is to have a really nice play button cell sap people can know to see that quite clearly and easily and then this example for a powerful you have this panel sliding out with all the right call sorts of such options for them so you could start sort by best match latest collection that kind of thing one one thing I still with the filters like this well as %HESITATION some companies but taking for example the sizing away when the infantry wasn't available and that caused the problems with people because they they didn't know if they would ever have that size in stock so imagine you know extra small being taken away just because it wasn't in stock people didn't know if it come back better experience that that is something like  you know enabling them to sign up to find out when it's back in stock stock but suddenly showing and sharing and then as the stable state is good said Hey you have cut as in price and one other thing I like about this design is it's very clear when you %HESITATION %HESITATION claiming the filters or applying the filters and then a separate check at the top in order to close the panel said that there's no confusion about what closing the panel does  so keeping on this topic of fat  we have other methods that %HESITATION will help with people with desks at one of those is adding custom suggestions that can be created from data and your application that said that can really help people with that sets and another one is a recent gravy suggestions so all of these %HESITATION technologies and facilities can go to make that such expense better so thinking through that such experience the mode that is is a good topic  comments and conventions so use is expected waiting smooth enough experience for finding landing back I'm purchasing products so let's look at a couple of things that the study revealed about comments and conventions and helping to drive that convention experience  so enabling comparison shopping features  so in this example on the active women I've been a stay Tapia and people that just that only able to scroll down and look at the different Hines anything they like they have to commit to memory and people you know what us you and me we will cognitive mais as we don't like to use up  inside my trailer eight am and way making the use the use that brain a lot have remembering where they sold things insightful but we can do bad up and some of those things that we sold sold that were implemented to help people in this way were letting people kind of book mop items that they soul so that they can combat that is still pretty difficult %HESITATION on mobile to do this but still anything we can do helps  so the example I'm gonna show you hair cut enable people to compact and then you can say it's quite constraints you know with the size of the phone but still you're bringing that information together it means they could ignore while all the other items that they didn't care about and they can compare the bedrooms they can come by the bathrooms the the cost of the home and so forth we know this is needed because in this study we saw people do work around that and SO in retail we saw people add items to that caught just so that they could look at them all in the same place and that was the uses that thought about doing that other other people struggled so we know this is needed so I think about the comparisons and the browsing experience that people and meeting with Daniel at  and then making it easy to add manage payment methods I actually I came across a poor example of this the other day and it was when I went to %HESITATION patches that I was I was going on vacation again I like to go on vacation  and %HESITATION I was making a reservation for a rental home and I got  to the point where I needed to %HESITATION update my cards say my model in my head was well a new car did arrive and say is simply the same card as before and it just had a new daytime it in my mind my mental model my card says the same card just needs replacing is not a new payment method so I expected to be out to edit my existing cards but there was no facility to do that so I kind of have to understand the developers model that I needed to add a new payment method  in this example that the person's got to the point where that space to be checking out but there's no way to edit console adding you called  that somewhere else in some other settings but you know most of us don't think well you know I'm gonna wake up in the morning and think I need to manage my payment methods and I kind of as a sector activity right we tend to think about it when we need to do it when we come to pass  so this is a problem here so I'm in this example is much better that's an option to add to existing Hans I the new payment methods  and the provide multiple payment methods here and the people to a very clean form design here when the use of its chosen to pick to add any credit cards %HESITATION and they can even scan that card if they wish to say making that experience nice and clean  now one facility that we offer it at Google is android plan pays say making that a choice of one of the ways to pay  the idea here is is is really simple for the user and CMS for the user to pay through android pay and those I think there's a talk about him I am and that's more information that you can get at this link  seven distribution registration is really popular out with that you know companies and developed as because it seems to be that that way we can get engagement from the user and that's kind of where the use that commits to us we've known for a long time that providing these registration barriers up front can be a big hurdle for people to get to and it's better to offer them something fast and say that they can fail a you know start to failing gauge my from that site to the company and there's a couple of other things I want to talk about today with regard registration so we saw uses struggle with signing in and signing up it's a tricky thing right we often so use is starting to fill out a form if they were provided one and realizing they with signing a mind that was supposed to be signing up and vice versa probably happen to all of us and so we found a better experience when people would just given the option to sign in or register the words were very different they could differentiate them and then that we could channel them down the right kind of route said that they didn't get into that model  we have lots of solutions for registration and identity at Google we have a whole identity platform that I'd encourage you to look at %HESITATION is base isn't basically an old system and it has several components and different choices for you to make  so one of these is signed them for android enables the user to sign in with the same credentials that they use on Google makes the whole intent is to make that process more for seamless and simple for them  and talking of that there's other ways to make password authentication of friction less experience  we've all been in this situation where it just doesn't work out for us and it's quite painful a may ball to keep put your password in and it's not working it can be even less in apps because we often find that this was a place where people were sent back out to the mobile web right say then you're in that leap again and that's even more aggravating say we've talked about one solution for easing fat enabling people to sign in another one that we saw that's becoming much more popular is fingerprint sign it  and in our study people were pretty am happy about this they like the idea very much of doing this so I think this is a good thing to look and see  and we have some more implementation details for you for you here by using fingerprint scans on supported devices  I'm not lock is another part of IT %HESITATION identity system enables you to automatically sign uses into the act using credentials that they've saved said that Sir another really good one part of this federated identity provision and  if you haven't got that far with uses does also sign and hit on this M. allows us to use the credentials  I TI it enables you to give hints to the use of a signing in for that use the name and email address everything is done to kind of ease that sign in and huddle  so for men three we've been talking at the you know in design about full Menteri for years and yes we did a lot of black on full Menteri for %HESITATION for desktops and %HESITATION when we went to the mobile web we kind of had to re learn all about again and again you'll remember when those forms used to be really really tiny and you have to expand them to to fill out the form it's always been a little bit backed up with that because would be designing forms from the get go for the mobile devices but I'm pleased to say I think we've come a long way but that's that was still things we saw enough study %HESITATION that could be improved  so I've kept crisis on the building user friendly forms and some of the things I soul with stills some apps requiring users to do a lot of work on that part putting that cast of in several different fields but that phone numbers and things like that takes a lot of effort on the part of the user and also not being out to see what form fields were coming up was a problem for use as it was hard for them to sort of build a mental model of what they would have to fill in next to a close in frustration and was definitely a friction points  so better engagement here is doing %HESITATION work on the back and so you know whether the user wants to writes in that phone number with dashes in between the numbers with spaces in between that number is always just one long failed we need to  to cater for that and make it is a little bit more what for us on the development side but it makes it a whole lot easier for the user to understand what they're doing and not get you know and and %HESITATION returns so will say you know whether our am is providing those in line is really helpful and here we have %HESITATION and not that does a really good job of like moving the form up the field as a user fills the end and we we found that was a very advantageous to use as  so we have a lot of information on creating great tax bills three material design tells a lot about the different aspects of creating a good phone  and for specifically for places we can use places order completes as part of the place is a P. I. again and this time may be helpful and  filling in those phone fails that require location  another aspect to form design is matching the keyboard with the required text input this is a fairly well known thing today but we still saw significant I'm not doing this well so when the user put that casa and the credit card failed and if you've got this in your you should check it out is it doing the right thing right in this example here is not doing the right thing the use is left with this keyboard and they don't have any way of getting the right keyboard up not you know not usually they they hit the number key I have and then they'll get that the keyboard with the numbers that along the top as opposed to designing that appropriately and once the castle  send that bringing out the %HESITATION they %HESITATION numeric keyboard for them  said the little things like this all these little things on forms ready ida and just checking out your form design in this way is %HESITATION really helpful for people  so we've got information on specifying input method type and the and the correct ski boat that you can find at this link  then lastly let's look at usability and comprehension these at those small things that you can do that we saw in our studies throughout the act throughout the apt to make a more seamless experience for uses it can be critical for in showing a good user experience and not having uses get stop all abandoned that experience at any point  this one's about providing text labels and visual keys to clarify visual information so we saw this idea in my story I was specifically missing a visual key I just needed that is waits in the picture to help me understand the orientation of the hotel  take a look at this example here  just take a couple of moments and decide for yourself what you think those icons represent  some of them for obvious another us to have a look at the answers  Hey we guys so it's my trips  book  club to an account did anyone get them right  I think that probably accounts wasn't too bad  but the lesson he yeah that we saw it again I think it's over generalizing you know it's like the role that we would gave is that when when I comes a vague then they definitely need tax labels the trouble is that in saying you know when I come to Vegas we all have different levels of understanding with regard that you have to I think assume that a lot of your icons are gonna be bay I can give you an example say you know the the %HESITATION I confer filter that looks kind of like this  and you think that would be fairly universal it's joining quite different ways across many different apps and we said he didn't find it universally understood among people so I think we have to you know change all kind of level set with regard to which you know the number of icons and items that need to have labels if people again and stand and this is a very great place where you can do simple A. B. testing and see the difference between between providing labels and not providing labels  Hey we've got some implementation details for when you want to use text and icons for buttons if you have that that  and then talking of labeling things that always makes me aware of making my application accessible %HESITATION we have lots of guidelines here for you to make sure your application is accessible  I  the last fence about I'm gonna go into today is asking for permission sing context  so this is something that we enabled with android M. but we seals still see that significant number of apps on making advantage of it is being able to you Abby possible and I went for a while now as well so in this example the user has just downloaded and open the app and then immediately asked can that location be used say perhaps they sat out with suggested to them by somebody else they said no this is a really good app if you want to learn about him deco and go to medical things then you can buy %HESITATION but it's kind of saying most similar to how we would think of problematic registration might when you offer that up front and it's a hurdle to get to get over this is the same thing for use as a slight that developers saying you know provide me with your location before I give you anything else right %HESITATION and uses often gonna say no because they don't really understand why they just wanted to look nonchalant  says I'm a better way to do that and you can do that now because of android M. is %HESITATION being out to do that in context at run time in this example we have people searching for a Stolz said much better because the user has their own motivation right they want to be able to find that stole and then what happens next is even more clear for them does a mat that comes up behind and a lousy asks come usually location but of course you can  right you're much more likely to get acceptance if you ask and context  we have lots of resources for you for  yes we have a great little videos and M. implementation details about being out to request to missions in one time and it simply in these principles because although you know I know many of you know about it we saw at all and in the apps that we studied recently saying %HESITATION that's why it's him  said that brings me to the end of the principles I'm going to go through with you we've gone to each of these chapters in you can find more of these principles online that all online at think with Google  and I made a short length you have specifically to the principles back to mobile user experience  there's actually multiple sets of principles let me tell you what that is this mobile principles new set of twenty five mobile principles there's a new set of twenty five principles for V. tab that's both web and again we did a study and say we can say to the information provided that back and then there's the mobile web principles that %HESITATION we publish previously that you might have already seen all at this late same link  and if you want more implementation details on the mobile website the principles are also part of our web fundamentals %HESITATION site and that particular link I provided with you that provides that additional developer implementation details  before I go I want to tell you about one more story from the study  so in this study and number  after the implemented the ability to scan your credit card in order to pay now we've got a few people in the study that had to use that for full and come across it and liked it but because this is a relatively new technology we had some people that I encountered that for the first time now if you think about the way scan %HESITATION my most familiar experience I think with the wet Scott is when I get to the place to be dole and scanned my credit card right and I'm I'm putting my credit card right next old putting it through it another machine ready that's scanning another another place I know if the word scam is you know putting %HESITATION pay for the fed Cup yeah that's kind of a little further longer again but still not scanning putting something on top of each other said the users come to this that request to scan my credit card they that's their use of the word scan if you imagine them trying to translate that but often the first thing this office can we use your camera and well is a comer anything to do with scanning my credit card well maybe I don't really understand it but yeah okay you can use my camera and then it asks you to hold the credit card hit was scion automatically okay following the instructions no surprise then we still three people in the study do this  and they waited and they way it's it  and they were terribly disappointed because they thought it sounded so you know simple way to pay  and this is just about as understanding what we're asking people to do and that  language %HESITATION using it's plain and simple usability we don't love this to work fortunate
