resolutions my name's Bobby Ghosh on an injured around  remember park when faced its campus revert to talk to someone who I think maybe has the coolest job in design maybe maybe he's great  who is this new woods he's the head of design here is basically gonna tell us about his design philosophy the evolution of designing Facebook and dreaming design  really get to this stick around  one quick point message  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  thanks for joining us I'm really excited to be here awesome first question what's one thing about design that's clear to you that you don't think it's as clear to other people wow this is the big question  and it's a little bit hard for me to say exactly what it is that's clear to everybody else about design but I can share one thing that's clear to me and that is that right now is an incredible time to be a designer  so many of the products that we use and depend on  on day to day are products of design and the apps that we use on our phones the apps that we use to get work done the apps that we use to communicate and stay in touch with the friends and family who are most meaningful to us  these are all products of design and I'm not sure that everyone in the general public realizes that the apps that they use that they love day to day are products of design and that they could get involved in shaping those products if they were to get involved in the design field  you know I'm also not sure that so many people in the larger array of design disciplines like graphic design and industrial design architecture and so forth I'm not sure that the broader design community really realizes just how special the time is right now for digital product design  you see you got into the I listen to an interview with you where you said you got into design and idiosyncratic way and and your chance %HESITATION I wonder do you think most designers get into designed that way because I I share similar story I didn't intentionally get into it  you know I'm one of the one of the one of the best designers that Facebook and he got started here doing an internship while he was in real estate development school  we have we have designers who got started  as as musicians and and %HESITATION and we had  designers who who who who studied economics in school we've we even have designers who didn't go to school at at all and one as for example who joined us right out of high school and was just making apps and submitting them to the apps store and was just just doing it just living it  and then you know I think it is the case that many people and up falling into design and I I was really lucky and my mom is a career coach and my dad is a professor I grew up in Columbus Ohio and so you know my mom really wanted me to get out and experience different things and %HESITATION you know my dad had a lot of different connections through Ohio State University and %HESITATION just help me get connected to the people who were doing design and and what was amazing about getting connected to designers like gun  for example there is a company in Columbus at the time sich it started as Richardson Smith changed its name to fits it was one of the very early design consulting companies one of their claims to fame was the Iomega zip drive  that's funny an anecdote about the zip drive and the jazz drive is that D. V. on the intent behind the names is that they were names that one might name your dog  jazz and so you know when I was in high school and I was lucky to go and spend a month maybe six weeks at Fitch I'm working with a small group of designers there %HESITATION and that was before I even even went to design school and so you know I really got lucky so many people on end up stumbling into the world of design and I think something that's important for us designers design leaders to do more of is you know share relatable stories about about the field and help more people become aware that it exists and that it's an exciting applied career path for folks besides sharing stories what are other things of this on your computer to like shed light on the fact that the size an interesting opportunity especially for students who are still undecided about what they want to do  I think it's a great question you know your question makes me think of somebody who inspires me who I think is a great designer and also someone who's great at communicating design to a broader audience I'm when I was in grad school in Seattle Washington I was lucky enough to meet a  send named Maurice woods and Maurice had completed his MFA at your job couple years before me  and he started a program called interact project in  and you know with this program he wanted to bring designed to the community and  Maurice I'm he's like six foot seven he's a former professional basketball player he played pro ball in your out and  in my early days in Seattle I I volunteered for interact project and I got to see him first hand talking about design to a group of under privileged middle schoolers and  you know it was really eye opening he was able to connect with the students I'm talking about talking about basketball talking about %HESITATION sneakers you might be excited about the latest air Jordans you know  you can actually design No shoes that's a career that's a career path you can study industrial design and I went to college at the university of Cincinnati  doc is is what the school is is known by two to to those in the know  and then a part of that program is  required internships so it's actually a five year design course with about a year and a half of internships and a number of the people who I went to design school with went to do internships that Nike adidas under armour companies like that and some were even designing shoes designing sneakers and so you know I think that the the story the exam  ball of mo is a really important story for %HESITATION for design leaders to keep in mind and in particular how he can see how he can meet people where they are and kind of talk to them on their own terms very says using the lexicon of design that you know we all know but might not be as accessible to regular folks  open with saying that %HESITATION  even designers in our industry don't fully understand %HESITATION the gravity and and and specialness of the moment for design right now I'm I'm curious what what many when you use the word special what exactly referring to and I'm also  curious about %HESITATION what role you think design plays in people's lives not just designers laps but  in the human being's life  I'm you know I think that we are  living in a time that is a little bit it can to the  industrial revolution of the twentieth century and a time when there were many many products being manufactured for mass use and when people realize that those those products could be could be designed they didn't have to emulate hand craft of the past  in school I was really fortunate lucky enough to be able to go and visit the the powerhouse in a school that we often learn about when we're studying design and down into the boat house got started in the town and  many called Weimar and it moved to a different location a city called decile and then you know why why is this beautiful town and decile is kind of injury or hit dust real town but the reason why the school moved there was to be close to industry to be close to manufacturing to be close to the technology of the time  that was where I had  jet engines were being manufactured and they wanted to be there with the breakthrough technology so that they could utilize that as they were designing things for people and I think that is the %HESITATION that is similar to the moment that we're in right now for a digital products I'm you know we depend on digital products to get work done we depend on %HESITATION spread sheets and documents and calendars we depend on digital products apps  to communicate and share with the people that we love and digital products are part of the the fabric of our everyday life  and  for folks who are you getting started in design and or even for a design schools it's it's not always apparent that things like apps are products of design you know it's easy to think  I mean an apt an act is a diminutive worried it sounds so small and so cute  and apps have been around for a while  well they must be figured out right  and that having worked at a place like Facebook now for about five and a half years there's a lot that still needs figuring out and there's a lot left to design  I'm one of my favorite posters around the office says Sam  the journey is one percent finished and I think that that speaks to just how much work there is yet to be done in the realm of digital products  when you talk about design and Facebook do you emphasize  design or problems solved  you know both product design and problem solving and more broadly are important  I prioritize and deep product design however when talking about design and Facebook  and the reason why I do that is because  the design team here is uniquely positioned to shape the products that people are using every day  and if the designers here don't do that nobody nobody else will  you know we depend on designer is to ensure that our products are well crafted  they're easy for people to use and that they help people solve real problems there really beneficial and and valuable to fox  broader skills like problem solving storytelling empathy those are important  for everybody at Facebook  as you know really it so many people here are involved in making products for people  I am but I tend to emphasize those less because there's something that I expect of the the full community of people here who are who are working on products  do you %HESITATION do you think designers are responsible for what they create I'll tell you I'm asking I mean we are now sitting in a contentious political environment certainly the most heated in my lifetime %HESITATION at the center of it is Facebook the news feed  the news feed certainly is  very very powerful at disseminating information  but perhaps the the falsehoods that are permitted the walls a Facebook %HESITATION have been problematic I wonder what designers of Facebook think about that  you know we take these issues very seriously and the things that we're working on now in fact there are lots of people working on these challenges today are there things that we've been working on for a while also you know we really want to connect people with the stories that they find most meaningful  and we know that people care about getting information that's accurate  and  I can give a a specific example and that's kind of interesting  and sometimes people share stories on Facebook and without having to even read the article they're sharing based on the title alone  and  sometimes those types of shares are the types of shares that  because %HESITATION sensationalism or polarization  and you know as we learn something like that when we're working deeply on an area like this and we can factor that into how we design news feed because we want news feed to connect people with the most meaningful information and we want  Facebook at large to create a global community of informed and specifically engaged people well  are you looking at building products that help %HESITATION people that might be stuck in their own political bubbles think a little bit broader because being informed yeah I I hear you on what you're saying people want to be more informed right but there are quite there there are different variations on quality of information and false information is still information so you can still be informed %HESITATION what is Facebook doing now to make sure that %HESITATION people are getting access to the right information so a couple of things first there's a lot of work that we are doing to remove and eliminate hoaxes on Facebook and this includes things like better detection up front as well as partnering with third party fact checkers  separate from that there is this question about %HESITATION you know how how can some  we have a more nuanced understanding of of an issue and that's a very interesting space to design within  and we have learned and in fact research shows that if you present somebody with an article on that opposes the article that they just read it actually doesn't help them to think more broadly about the topic it begets polarization  I'm you can contrast that with %HESITATION for example I'm getting to know a person a human being as a human being and not just an issue  and and when you get to know somebody as a human being you see many more of the the the the shades of gray and much more of the new ones and so an interesting opportunity for Facebook in the long term might be and helping people to connect with other individuals Adam more human level rather than %HESITATION simply presenting you know alternate sides of the same issue thruster just  %HESITATION simplify just a little bit me say connect people are more human level you're suggesting that Facebook essentially in this moment could find people with opposing viewpoints and and get them to  B. friend each other online or like what what is that connection look like you know this is an early days area so it's hard to say specifically but if you think about some of the different %HESITATION things that we formed community a  round you know one example is %HESITATION  sports I'm you know I'm I'm I'm a soccer fan Sameer  and and and and you know there is a community of soccer fans around the world and that community is going to include people who have really different perspectives on different issues but because we have that in common I think it can help for us to be able to connect more and for you know me to be able to hear your point of view more and and vice versa I see so it's finding other things I can get people in the same room and then going from there instead of them standing at opposing sides on one thing excising so cut going deeper into this %HESITATION to the people side of things %HESITATION you manage a massive social good initiative with Facebook %HESITATION I'm curious what is the goal of this initiative like what are you what are you trying to what is the outcome you're seeking and if you can tell us about some of the features of products that come out of this so far  I am doing a lot of work and in the social good space today and  you know I was the head of design at Facebook I I really like to be able to focus and go deep on one or two areas of work at any given point in time  and you know I I don't and review all of the work that happens across the company and I don't even know if I would have the time to be able to do that and you know I try to bring it in great  leader is an empower than with very big areas lots of runaway and to work on important things and that's what enables me to go deep on one or two topics at any given point in time you know in the past I've worked too deeply on a number of different things including for example  helping Facebook work better for people who are new to the internet in emerging markets places like India Mexico or Brazil and a messenger when we saw an opportunity to kind of re boot and a re design and build messenger from the ground up and and what I'm focused on today is social good which fits a little bit more broadly into an  mark has described as our work building social infrastructure to keep people safe  and there's a lot of work in the social good space that I'm really excited about  I've spoken about safety check a number of times before which  is a meaningful product to me at two different levels I think safety check helps people in the world who are faced with a crisis too easily reassure their loved ones that there okay and to feel reassured that their friends and family are okay  but on another level that's a really exciting product to me because  it's a product that  came about in a very organic way at Facebook  the origin stories of safety check are actually a small hackathon in our our tiny office in Tokyo  I'm what I'm excited about most now in the social good space is a build on top of safety check which we just announced two weeks ago  and is called community help so if you're in a crisis the most important thing is to communicate that you're okay and to check in on others  but after that you might really need some help  you might need help you know you might need water you might need shelter you might need food or a whole series of other things and the community health product is designed to meet those needs so for example Jared if you have some water to offer you can do so and I'm coming to the product I've indicated that I'm safe I don't have any water so I'm pretty worried  and Facebook can help facilitate that match  this is a product that was inspired by %HESITATION talking to real people  you know we put people at the center of everything that we do  and we were talking to people in Chennai India after the floods there a year or two years ago and there were amazing things happening with people coordinating and complex spreadsheets  and you know different resources in order to try to help each other so we want to make that through better design a little bit easier and more scalable and more accessible to the number of crises that people face each year so the turn I floods is this an example where did you guys decide to send people to India and and experience the the chaos and %HESITATION I guess be a bit of a an observer %HESITATION is that is that the process used there or did you wait until everything was kind of cleared out to figure out %HESITATION how Facebook it played a part we we did some work to understand has things were unfolding  and but we did a lot of work in the follow up research afterwards to you and to see because afterwards you can you can talk to people and understand what what really works and not just what's what's happening what's emerging and so it was very important to get that %HESITATION %HESITATION after the fact kind of kind of perspective in input  given your position and Facebook %HESITATION the could be seen in a positive sense %HESITATION as signaling  when you pick something to focus your time when you're speaking about earlier there many initiatives and from time to time you try to focus on one or two right I'm so really curious why you chose social good now like what what drew you to that is something that should double down on  so what excited me about that area is a few different things one  was the change from when I was working on before  and that you know before joining Facebook I worked at I DO and one of the biggest things that I learned that idea was that it's great to try new things you never really know what thing you're gonna love  so social good was new and it was different from messenger  I also like to really work in areas where design is a little bit more nascent so this was a new area and there were there was no team it needed to be created from scratch and that's the type of problem that I I personally get really excited about and then thirdly and the the the the mission behind the work keeping people safe is one that that I find to be very very meaningful and I think that there's a lot that Facebook can uniquely do in order to to help you mention I DO I'm also curious about that transition to write like I DO the works that tends to come up and there's more blue sky and higher level thinking %HESITATION more extract the some sense and when you came to Facebook you came to the group team I believe and growth at the time was also pretty knew what was in a similar story like what exactly attracted you to go from ideals to a Facebook working on growth that was such a new conference here more particular because growth is about yeah the smaller details right it's about it's about buttons and colors and positioning and copy that is yeah it's very interesting what cell Latin  no it is interesting to reflect on this I'm  I was really nervous when when coming  Facebook man you know I didn't I didn't know how how I would sit in or if I would fit and I also wasn't I wasn't looking and then one day received an email from from mark Zuckerberg  you know Hey look we're trying to build a great design team here at Facebook  okay  this is an unusual day yeah I'm  so I talked with him on the phone and learned a little bit more about what he was trying to accomplish and got to know him a little bit more and  you know I wasn't joining Facebook as a as a as a senior level person to lead something big I was joining as a product designer  and I didn't know what I would come and work on and %HESITATION and it's it's pretty incredible de and  degree to which mark %HESITATION values and understands the value of design that he would call up on the phone you know random designer who who might be interested in in coming to Facebook  I came in and %HESITATION  I started engineering boot camp  and that was a little bit of a shock and %HESITATION in fact I kind of a drop down during drifted away from engineering boot camp in order to help out with some things that seemed like they were problems that needed helping with at the time  we had just announced  time line we had just announced some changes to news feed with just announced a product called taker  the design team was maybe in the neighborhood of three dozen people and then there was one design critique a week for three thousand people  and we we could barely squeeze into the biggest conference room in the building  and you know I just wanted to roll up my sleeves and help with these different challenges  how can we make a product like ticker I work better for people how can we modify critique such that it will be done it would work at the scale of the design team that  I'm so I just kind of got started working on things  I did a hackathon on my very first hackathon  working with a a a a a great group and %HESITATION we designed and built a small feature for Facebook which enables you to save the post save an article  which is the thing on Facebook today and just a few months ago we we released a similar feature on Instagram  I  maybe about like six months in at Facebook  I was interested in shifting to become a manager and  when talking about this and they think the growth team stood out as an area that I was interested in and %HESITATION I was interested in the growth team because  I remembered their talk from orientation  and I remember it learning more and not talk than in any other talk  I remember coming away from not talk thinking less about my own personal experience with Facebook and more about some of the challenges that people around the world we're facing as they tried to use Facebook challenges like I'm you know what would it be like to be trying to sign up for Facebook to be required to have an email in order to sign up for Facebook and do not have or not know what an email  and so on so  I I felt like I learned a lot from that one talk probably one hour and  you know leaning on my my biggest take away from from I DO try new and different things I said I'm interested in growth let's go and figure this out  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work  here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users that's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  of course we're inspired by our design program which is over sixty years old  today IBM employs more than one thousand three hundred professional designers and we've sort of  five more than sixty thousand IBM verse in the practices of IBM design thinking  the result  divers teams working more closely than ever with our clients their users and our partners to create modern solutions  %HESITATION provide differentiated human centered outcomes to the world we'd love to share the story more closely with you  and I hope to see you soon at one of our IBM studios worldwide  we'd also like to thank our friends envision for their support invasion is the world's leading product design platform power in the future of digital design to their understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One Netflix Airbnb  I work with remote things all the time I found the keeping a healthy dialogue is really important without it building strong work relationships gets a lot harder and that leads to poor collaboration  I've also found the prototypes are great way for me to show my full vision for design and this helps cut down a lot of back and forth  invision makes all this really easy you can rack in the prototype %HESITATION designs and collaborate across every stage of your project taking your ideas from concept to code it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration of core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers developers and writers  teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when the using vision suite of prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit envision out dot com slash hi res  three months  right so mark reached out to you in two thousand eleven  this is a year before the IPO which means he was busy was well in it and he reached out to a product designer out of idea why is that did he know you will be seeing you  you know I think that ten mark reaching out is  is is a reflection of of how much he values design and I think one of the top priorities for Facebook in two thousand eleven two thousand and twelve was %HESITATION scaling the design team and creating a really strong design foundation to support the future scale of Facebook  and %HESITATION  I'm when I when I was in Seattle %HESITATION in grad school at you dub me in a very city of Washington I'm my my gig was TA in different early design classes  and  in one of those classes or maybe two I had a couple of students who were particularly talented bunch  one ended up %HESITATION getting an internship at Facebook  in fact I think that his plan was to get hired by Facebook and drop out of school and if things had gone according to plan we probably wouldn't have even that went  but they didn't go quite according to plan he ended up with an internship instead of a full  find a job and then return internship and then he started working at Facebook after  after school  and that was at a point in time where the Facebook design team was very small like as a guest maybe a dozen people  and I'm that was at a point in time where there was a very high technical bar for a designer is that Facebook designers were expected to design but also to be production level friend and engineers  and then  this individual true and he helped to open up Facebook's and brought in Facebook's definition of design and that started to pull in a few talented designers who he knew and then he pulled in one two three he helped to pull in me so I think true is another part of the the the story right  %HESITATION I mean the it's funny because I think that that speaks to something that drew me to Facebook and Facebook is all about people connecting about communication and I'm that is the way that so many things get done you know were it not for I'm  our broad communication technology  true and I never would have connected never would have made the connection back here %HESITATION that's not the type of thing that one is likely to achieve throughout  you know working on that John  application tool or something like that that's a little bit more narrow in focus so coming back to your journey to the grill team baseball  %HESITATION that was very interesting time I suppose like it was still pretty new concept what works some new  things were discovered or created as far as your design process and how you thought about problems  I'm there a few big things one is that I'm I learned a lot and in the early days on the gross team about designing for people who aren't like you  and I mentioned the example of somebody on signing up for Facebook for the first time on their phone without have have an email address or even having heard of an email address what is this %HESITATION and that's a pretty amazing experience I mean that's that's what I would do I DO as well but %HESITATION I could get much deeper into it in the context of a Facebook in Facebook's global community of users %HESITATION so that's one huge learning and huge huge kind of take away from my early days on growth and another is sign  another is the importance of the data in designing products today  you know when you're designing for somebody who is really not like you it's hard to know what works  and so we can use data in order to understand you know is this really working for somebody is this  making it simpler for them to sign up and confirm their account on Facebook and or or or isn't it maybe it was a good idea but maybe it's not working maybe it's not quite working yet  and  I'm those warnings have informed on all of the work that I've done subsequently I think that data is one of the the best tools for a designer is today and it's a special tool that enables us to understand are the products were making really working for people I would also argue data is probably one of the most misunderstood  hill's corps or tools for designer right %HESITATION some people when they hear data they think it's cannibalizing their creativity like they don't  I can't do anything anymore because datasets axe or the is so it's B. R. and %HESITATION what are some things there's actually keep in mind when they're actually thinking about applying data to their design process and how should they actually approach it if they want to turn around and try this tomorrow  on one of the best pieces of advice that I could give is to and start your design process with data you know I'm as you are are thinking about and what might be it's great to talk to people to do user research to get maybe a descriptive analysis about how the product is working for people today  I'm to spend some time to just understand I'm and really really understand the area that you're working in  and sometimes up front in the data it  and help you to identify a special opportunity for design so  I'd encourage designers to start early thinking about data and you said I was there as they're identifying where the design opportunities might be  I also encourage designers to just be be open I'm D. are you know data enables us to be a step more empirical in understanding what works so %HESITATION don't be too attached to the thing that you're making on because you don't know necessarily whether it's going to work or not and that's okay it's that's okay it's a part of the process and maybe lastly I'd say I I think it's great for a designer is to %HESITATION  to learn about data and learn enough about it to %HESITATION to be able to %HESITATION asking good questions learn enough about it to be able to identify when the data might be fishy maybe this isn't actually accurate or or maybe %HESITATION maybe this isn't the data that matters  maybe it's something else that does  so you moved on from growth how long we in growth how many how many years or months were you on the grill team  hi  hi I worked directly on growing Facebook for maybe a couple years couple years okay so you had a couple of years of experience of growth on under your belt then you were put in charge of messenger from my understanding is that right you you let the design on the messenger team you you build the design teams  %HESITATION messenger %HESITATION how is it different than what how are the two teams operating differently and and what did you bring from growth to the messenger team I'm  so L. messenger was a really exciting opportunity and it was exciting because %HESITATION %HESITATION a couple of different threads were coming together and  one thread was that one of the designers and very talented designer who was working with me on growth at the time I was just interested in messenger and and was thinking about some of the problems that messenger was trying to solve and how they were inhibited by building messaging within the main Facebook app and so he started tinkering and %HESITATION putting together a son and son designed some some actually very sophisticated demos %HESITATION that showed what it could be like to to have a dedicated and standalone messenger app  and that kind of coincided with sun abroad and a strategic understanding at at the time %HESITATION as we %HESITATION  as we try to get a sense of %HESITATION what mattered for people I'm in a messaging product and the things that matter are things like you know getting really fast responses from the people who your messaging finding people right yeah right exactly and so on  so these different threads were coming together V. %HESITATION kind of broad strategic top down understanding  the bottom up tinkering and designing and imagining what this product could be like and myself and a number of people shift our attention from growing Facebook toward %HESITATION this different %HESITATION different opportunity different problem space messenger and actually we we applied a lot of the same types of thinking and the same learnings that we had from the growth space but of course the the  that the problem was a little bit different %HESITATION recreating kind of rebooting a whole new apps versus %HESITATION helping somebody in India sign up for Facebook on their phone what were some other principles on the on the go team that you brought to messenger so I I understand that designing for people that don't look like you or live like you is a big one %HESITATION  what else iterating fast maybe is that sold V. I. N.  at one other thing that I think is worth mentioning is that is is process and and there isn't a standard process at Facebook you know different groups different people have the autonomy to define the process that they believe is going to set them up for success in achieving their goals and mission  on the the folks on growth have a have a more %HESITATION %HESITATION a more refined process though that is one that that I really like and then that I believed in and and the process is simple  understand identify  execute  and I think it's a really special process and take the time to understand things before you get started making them you know I'm with the understanding that you have identify what is the biggest opportunity what are the most important problems to solve  I'm and I'm and then after you have that figured out you know execute you don't have to worry about the rest just focus on getting it done and making it real  I'm not the process that we employed on messenger and that's a process that I like to utilize %HESITATION in a whole range of different time challenges and opportunities that come up saw some so poor design teams were watching this listening and we're in the middle of stealing their own design teams are on Facebook I believe the design work is in the hundreds  four hundred  plus we don't release the number after signers of seven oaks working on on anything in particular but I think hundreds this fan so in a hundred so thinking about teams or in the tens right around the ones right now yeah %HESITATION looking back on how Facebook groups son organization what are some lessons that they can take away on how the scale not only just like getting the number of people within their team %HESITATION but their process other design language especially this stuff yeah I think one of the most important things for a team as they're scaling especially a small team is having the willingness to let go of things  what I really like all of them and because you have  to be willing to let go of big and important and exciting things in order to bring in the types of leaders that you're gonna need to depend on as you scale because before you know it they'll be more more work and more things than you can personally and individually attend to I think that that's the number one thing for me actually is on be willing to give things away  because you need to do that in order to get great people and there are other things as well so %HESITATION you know one thing that has worked  I think quite well at Facebook is that we built up a program inspired by engineering boot camp which all engineers go through when they get started here %HESITATION that we call design camp  and design camp is something that if you were starting at Facebook as a designer you would go through design camp for your first couple weeks and  that is a point in time where we can describe the context of Facebook we can  help you to %HESITATION I'd have sun %HESITATION techniques that might set you up for success we can explain our design philosophy and give you exposure to different design tools and so forth  and  as a team is growing quickly and you can reach a huge  portion of the design community by focusing on new people as they're coming in  another thing that has helped us to scale that's less in the in the people space that's a little bit more in the products space is  we call Stig the Facebook interface guidelines  and I think it is something that started in several years back and %HESITATION we wanted to create something that was a true to the way that Facebook works  the way Facebook works is you know lots of different people different groups who have lots of autonomy no top down process and  so  so we can set about to create %HESITATION components are built in code that designers and product teams could could use and are thinking was that it would be easier for a designer and for their team to grab this pre built component that has a whole bunch of things figured out that it would be to design something from scratch  and that would enable designers to focus on  identifying what are the unique problems that they need to solve  in what they're working on and put the majority of their design attention toward those unique problems  rather than you know bothering their energy a crossed every aspect of the design that's interesting you earlier you mentioned %HESITATION  the willingness to give something up to give things up I'm curious if you can give us an example something you gave up yeah I  think a an interesting example of that is on internet dot org in  internet dot org is a really big mission really exciting bringing people online I'm  it's it's a it's amazing and and I was taken aback when when mark said let's do this it just seems so big  and that's an area with a a where we were building up the design team from scratch it's an exciting problem if it's something that's really meaningful and and that that's something that instead of saying you know I want to roll up my sleeves and get involved in that I said you know I've been to one of the people on my team this might be a cool opportunity for you  and they've built up an incredible design team that's focused on internet dot org and is doing really amazing work that's that's not often seen by  folks like us here in California %HESITATION  and there are there are there are other examples as well you're when you're when you're meeting with mark or any of the other board members or people in the C. suite %HESITATION what perspective they expect you to bring %HESITATION to those meetings now  one of the things that Cheryl says on that resonates with me deeply is that time you should bring your whole self to work on and I'm so when I bring my whole self to work and that includes the part of me that's a designer I'm and so  you know I'm mark or Cheryl could expect me to bring a design perspective to bear on a given topic sure  how we could craft something better or how we can make something work better for people and but  but there are other aspects to who I am as well right you know I grew up in the Midwest  I'm kind of a quiet person I like to I like to listen and take a lot of things in and then and then kind of summarized back to people and I'm I'm an introvert mean we have we have posters around that say you know move fast I kind of feel like I'm a smoker  and so you know in that context I I bring my whole self which includes all these other aspects not to last me as a designer  what do you think the role of the designer is today  I think that tell our the role of of a designer today is %HESITATION is focused on shaping products making things that people use I'm  there's a really interesting %HESITATION exhibition right now in Kanazawa Japan that is about the line between craft and design  and  I think the difference between craft and design is is in part the scale you know when you design something you're deciding it to be used by many people many people who aren't you  and another a difference between design and craft is  typically that you depend on more people than just yourself to make something I'm  and the  I'm so design is all about making things where you need help from others to make it and you you hope that people beyond just you will be able to use it  I really like these kind of applied pragmatically practical definitions of design and what designers do and I also believe that things like storytelling and problem solving and empathy are important aspects of design but it's okay that fundamentally what we do is shaped the products that people use  and thinking a little bit ahead now for this honor  things like virtual reality artificial intelligence on kind of computing are finally getting kommer consumer rights %HESITATION and %HESITATION becoming a little bit more human like  in the future do you think we're going to come to think of these things as humans %HESITATION and whatever your opinion is around that %HESITATION how do you think that's going to influence the way designers actually designed for the system's going forward  you know it's hard for me to say if and when we might start to think of technology I'm in the way that we think of of of humans and what we really do here is put people at the center of everything that we do  but that doesn't mean that technology isn't an important part  and it makes me think of a at at at at  I am a few months back when our head of sound design I came up to me and he said Hey look I wanted to come and check out this thing  and so I put on the oculus had sat and he proceeded to take off  and fly around and and all the stuff and I said okay well that's that's pretty cool you know what's  what's to do here and %HESITATION and and and and will said okay now now try this version and so he gave me a different had sent and I put it on and then took the same trip but  it was much much more life like  it was totally different  it felt like an as I turn my head you know I could hear the engine behind me and the difference was that and there was spatial audio in the second version rather than the first  and that's a really cool break through we on we we we actually announced and released this yesterday so that people can %HESITATION incorporate spatial audio into their virtual reality or three hundred sixty degree videos and I think that showcases the way that technology moves on there are always different breakthroughs those breakthroughs are and really exciting for us designers because they they provide us with new opportunities but  but I think that in that example it also shows that people are at the center because that's all about making the experience for the the actor  much more realistic and lifelike as you look past your last five and a half years here %HESITATION you look at your entire body of work you think of how much you personally grown there are probably thousands of product design and you start as a product designer Facebook you are now five years later the head of design at Facebook in their product is on out designers out there wondering what was his journey what with the skills that Luke emphasized that brought him into a position to be able to now manage this big team and all of these fundamentally different yet super connected products what were some of the skills and and and and  growth for you you know I think I was really lucky I think I was lucky I had to be at a company like Facebook that was at a very high growth a point in time and and I I feel very fortunate for those opportunities that were in front of me  I think that %HESITATION there are a few different things that helped and one thing that helped is I'm  putting others first  this is the notion that time  the %HESITATION  business school professor Adam grant writes about man from time to time the notion that there are people who are giver is people who are takers and people who are not terrorists  and I'm  you know when I came to the Facebook I just tried to give as much as I could  and to do what was right for all of the people who are using the product do what was right for Facebook  I do what was right for the design community at Facebook and put myself at the bottom of the list and %HESITATION  and I think that the focus on  what's best for the community of people who use Facebook what's best for the company I think that those are the values and attitudes that helped me to get to where I am today do you think there are responsibilities %HESITATION that designer should be paying attention to today that could %HESITATION that maybe they're ignoring to their own detriment that could actually help  %HESITATION them up inside of their own companies help them grow and put you in as a put them on a similar trajectory as yourself you know I think one of the most important skill sets for a designer is is to %HESITATION  understand the context that they're operating within  you know understand of what a given company's values are understand where the company is trying to go understand what the company is all about and if you can do that then you can frame all the work that your doing as a designer in those terms and in that language that everybody's gonna understand  I'm and I think that sometimes designer is %HESITATION can end up stuck in the world of design  and and get too deeply into you know some particular facet of the design that they're working on  I mean I I was having dinner with a  with the C. a few years back and %HESITATION he said something that time  he said he said designers are like cats you just have to give them a ball of yarn  play with it  that's brutal it's brutal but on but there is some truth to that you know sometimes it does happen that a designer you can end up focused you know a little bit more on their portfolio piece than on and what's really going to be an important contribution  reminds me of the process you spoke about earlier understand identify execute oftentimes we get too caught up in a lot of  sure going to community corrections all right or in the last segment here we're making it okay so %HESITATION we reach out to our community and we asked them what matters the most with burning up inside them and they give us five questions that meant a great crew and I love that you're doing that yeah this is this is fun okay so when we're we're asking everyone this by the way so how should designers explain the role of designed to people in their business  I'm I think it's it's a past for designer is  to %HESITATION focus on explaining the role of design through concrete examples the best examples will come from within the organization that you're you're a part of so and if you want to and showcase are more broadly communicate the value of design in your organization  I think you should identify maybe a hero case for design and a a time where design really made a difference for something that matters to the company  and make sure to tell that story you know we improved the registration experience for people on Facebook and it made it much easier for people to confirm their accounts and now many more people are on Facebook because we made it easier  and and that type of hero case hero example it's almost self evident  there's no question about the value of design it's it's it's obvious that it's there  and you might have that here %HESITATION case already and you just need to communicated and frame it in that way or if you're just getting started and you don't have that here %HESITATION case you know look out for what that might be the second question is how was the design team at Facebook organized  I'm the way that we organize products at Facebook is that we have lots of small teams and each small team has %HESITATION has a lot of autonomy and responsibility for the area that they work on  so  this book is a big company and high growth company and but you might find yourself here working with a handful of engineers maybe one other designer couple of data people one project one product manager and you might find yourself in a very small group it might feel a lot like a start up but building on top of the Facebook platform in Facebook infrastructure rather than a start up building from scratch in the market and  so that's really how we organize and we think of their as being a few different pillars of product development these include product design data  engineering and product management and there's also a suite of other teams and disciplines that time are involved in shaping product like content strategy sound design research product marketing at cetera  so  for a given initiative we tried to assemble a team a great team a small team that can internalize the purpose of the work the goal that they're trying to achieve and can chart a course to do so  the next question is when you're the only designer and a company your far cry from that I get it but when you're the only designer in the company how do you convince the leadership in the company of the value that design brings you know being the only designer in a company is a unique situation I think it's a unique talent it's it's tough to be by yourself and it's also kind of a a cool opportunity because there's lots of room to grow from one  I think how to convince people of the value of design is going to depend a little bit on the organization itself and what the organization is all about  I'm one thing that I did when I was getting started on growth that %HESITATION I think work well that's maybe a small tip that that folks might  fifty eight is on  I am I give a book to my manager and the book that I gave to my manager at the time was on a book called the universal principles of design  and I chose that book very carefully  I chose that book because it's very accessible  it's very simple it's like fifty a hundred different examples one page at a time of different ways that design could add value  and then I have and you know  I don't know if you read the whole book or not but I know that he at least read a few of the examples because they they became fodder for future conversation while  and %HESITATION  US so I'm not might be that might be a small thing sure  next question is how should designers measure and present results of their work  measurement on the results of of one's work are really important things but I question a little bit weather designers are the ones who should be measuring their results of their work you know designers aren't necessarily neutral in that case nor are we necessarily experts in data and understanding things so I mean it would be great to have somebody who's depth is data and understanding to be  there to talk about and describe and define whether this is working or isn't working  and I think it's important to do so in a in a really %HESITATION  neutral a really empirical kind of way  I think that you could run into lots of problems if you try to cherry pick something that's working well or I'm kind of over a cell  so we get in with this final question  as the function of design continues to evolve as a has been %HESITATION what are some roles are methodologies that you think might emerge over the next five years  over the next five years I think I actually think that we will continue to see digital products focused on people %HESITATION at at the forefront I'm and I hope that over the next five years we'll see more people more designers today get involved in design of digital products I hope that we'll see more people at large get into design and into %HESITATION the design of digital products I hope that we'll see a more diverse community of people get into design you know there was something there was a study a week or two ago that was released that I was looking at %HESITATION Terence subsidizing the income of twenty somethings in in urban environments and of course the discipline that's at the top of the list of parents subsidies is the arts  and then I think that that is something that can not something that can really change if more people get involved in applied product design and a special  so we have digital products on the technology will change it always does  we'll have more lifelike more realistic and experiences that are possible the band with %HESITATION will increase and %HESITATION  audio and other types of things will be more important %HESITATION but I think that fundamentally one of the constants for design will be that we're shaping the products and that we're putting people first  well look thank you thank you  thanks buddy thanks Jared  the end
