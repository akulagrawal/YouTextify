it is surrounded funny message to sister in this is Ben Barnes and this is almost every life ok all the one sheet this is why we take my love experimental design and put it together every episode we choose one baby take the movie poster by the time this episode is alien from 1979 directed by with iska storing sigourney Weaver Tom skerritt John Hurt Yakub Memon heritance panoramic write the design of a company called in Singapore some interesting quiz Posters for Star Wars the last Jedi Knight alien Covenant motor project will be hosted I wanted you seen the poster for moon mai how is awake and from hypersleep investigator distress call from a plane is the day of catching by ball on the plane A1 decrease IT Act 67 enough disastrous of alien 1979 this is a poster of that is Biomass is tightening is the medicine white yeah yeah right now it is the feeling when you get this is this idiot liveleak write down its Italy ominous feeling which goes does it movie you see this ad and its like cracking locate the text the economic which is really sorry this is even out the green spelling out in a glowing effect spelling in OpenOffice base something even without where Windows is the shape that indicated by the composition in the peace is an hourglass so you think can it slowly studying to crack open combined with this hourglass shape of the composition and is overflowing you just breathing Adidas eat to figure out something about the time is ticking that's amazing way I never I never apart the hourglass it all Abba like anbanavan you say I am looking at in it I like it stop you and that is your soul awareness and avayogi and explain the play fix poor when I go inside the alien spaceship there's always like you you like just organic extra every 1831 mixer motor repairing why the tip prioritised information alien is this page from keyboard sensor typeface that will attract also its track just shut up 5 with an attractive type write the space between letters is so uncomfortable again it kuch army education is like crazy but it's because it's the same time it is seen at the bottom of the peace so this whole composition disease is busy at the seeker not feeling not well about this poster 9010 will give some posters the Param credits like text and Black in the designer stores attitude status for this version I think I know why I'm a gas here because the composition of the peace in black is so strong and you get the hourglass shaped Eyes what's there in why did the call attention to me the layout and nothing surrounding it so that's really interesting Pawan Singh a to write is that the logo of the name is the name the phone in the bar and credit section seems to be of centre of the earth largest Rose that entire week asymmetry is centred symmetry of Amy Elizabeth techniques to enable itself this is can I like it look like a fire was like a description 5 things with design inside I want to come in this river basin in past posters this is perfectly symmetrical first six symmetry causes of conflict because when I sure way to work with water I supposed online to install again the country visited at this address on conserve fuel needed for the first you ask you question sister is used as you are talking about the thing is that I noticed is that the tagline in space no one can hear you scream very small as compared to you I think I'm really do I think that have first clients that's not attract so much attention Infinity track from the position sizing is an acid is a good example of Hierarchy if you want to know that the sum is a bad thing you can I can only imagine read in space no one can hear you scream today you have hurt so you can I get up from it recruiter space no 150 screen and acquisitions things really done in the highest why is that they are likely in a day before you in the same way they like you doing for others like small red version smoke what was the spaceship in my cutie or back by NIOS 10th cost of a basic you have domain and that that tell me all about the film in the personal it's time for you now Anna Hazare the name and if you some reason watching this video I am so sorry bolaji badejo who is the person who played the alien with graphics he was 71854 Delhi and he had synonyms with perfectly allowed him to set what privileges greedy dog budget of the storm on the strength of business card storyboard over the message space journey what are the most memorable kisses some of the best cigarette on according to catch fire and everything about him in the post admit now it check the Powder that focuses your eye on the actual content of the poster is reminiscent of what training technique is the head of French play some people this was in episode of the 10 worst when I get the Priyanka instance master Yevadu film in aqueous new design thanks so much for watching if you like it but I like and subscribe if you not subscribe already what is now if you like this method section for well because we would like to continue making my show for happiness all right Hey everybody %HESITATION it is %HESITATION I don't even know what it is  from the top  Hey everyone my name is Stuart Shuster and this is been burns and this is a little show we like to call the one sheet  this is where we take my love of film and Ben's love of design and put the two together every episode we choose one movie take the movie poster of it and break it down this episode is alien from nineteen seventy nine directed by Ridley Scott and starring Sigourney weaver Tom Skerritt in home John hurt Yafa koto my man Harry dean Stanton and Veronica Cartwright the designer was a company called insync plus some of their recent work includes posters for Star Wars the last chat I login it comes at night alien covenant the Florida project in another movie poster that I want to do soon the poster for moonlight  those of you who don't know what alien is about the crew of the space ship a strong %HESITATION is awakened from hyper sleep to investigate a distress call from a planet that they are passing by while on the planet one of the crew was attacked which sets up a chain of disastrous events  so alien nineteen seventy nine this is a poster that is  actually almost as frightening as the move it so I  oh my god you know before you sent this to me I'd never seen this man and this put the the movie in a whole new light yeah yeah it's very ominous yeah yeah gosh well looking at this poster I can tell you right now it is absolute it's just gorgeous the feeling that you get when you look at this is just you get slightly creeped out it's a it's an eerie ominous feeling which goes just it's perfectly aligned with the movie one thing I notice you see this egg and it's like cracking okay the texture of the egg kinda looks like the movie which is really neat so we know that this is even without the green whose spilling out and the glowing effect spilling into the egg we know that there's something up it's this is like a space kind of ag because there's something wrong here even without that we noticed that the shape  that's indicated by the composition of the piece is in our class  so you've got this egg kind of slowly starting to crack open combined it with this hourglass shape of the composition and it's almost like you're just waiting on the on the edge of your seat to figure out if something's about to happen like time is ticking that's amazing way I never I never thought about the I I our last name ideal ever like and but now when you say and I'm looking at it and I see it like if if it wasn't our last that would be where the sand is going down it's dropped IT there and that the war right there is you know sort of reminiscent of the organic floor on the plan  that they go to explore when they go inside the alien spaceship there's all these like really like just organic textures everywhere right now and that actually even makes it more creeping he had her a there's there's nothing not creepy about this piece but I I also want to call attention to the way that they've prioritized information %HESITATION alien is this big chunky bold sans serif typeface that's really tracked out and so it's tractor this this truck that type but then there's trucked out type right so that the space in between these letters its soul uncomfortable that again it just put you on the edge of your seat because you're like it's almost cringe a little bit but it works it works because it reflects the same kind of with that scene at the bottom of the piece  so this whole composition is is this bizarre theory the edge of the seat kind of feeling and that's what I love about this poster  nine times out of ten when we look at film posters the bottom credits  are alike text on black  and the designers chose not to do this for this for this version I think I know why I'm gonna guess here because the composition of the peace in black is so strong and you've got the hourglass shape I think that they box that in with white just to call attention to only that lay out and nothing surrounding it means so that's really interesting to me  the one thing I don't like is that the logo or the name of the %HESITATION the name of the film in the bottom credit section seems to be off center a little bit  that just throws that entire lake %HESITATION symmetry that centered symmetry offer me and countless there's a there's a bit of text next to it I can't tell what it says but this is kind of like it looks like a client was like Hey we got to add a description there next to the logo %HESITATION so that kind of feels like one of those last minute client things that the designers like %HESITATION I don't want to carry on with this over a little bit but we also talked about this in in the past posters this is perfectly symmetrical and that perfect symmetry causes some conflict because we're not sure where to look %HESITATION what what are I suppose online too in cell again that contributes to that bizarre edge of the seat uncomfortable feeling that you get from the poster yeah  let me ask you a question %HESITATION I was looking at this poster is your as you were talking about it and one of the things that I noticed is that the tagline in space no one can hear you scream  very small  as compared to literally all the other tight on the poster  we thought about that I think it's a higher key thing I really do I think that at first glance  that's not gonna tracks so much attention it's gonna detract from the rest of the composition so I think it's a I think it's a good example of hierarchy if you want to know what the film is about then you're gonna come to lean in and read in space no one can hear you scream  you know like so you can have to lean into it to to get that from it they could have blown that out and just like made this the whole post  in space no one can hear you scream and then I think that would ruin the compositions I think it's really artfully done in the higher fees choice yeah I love that the way you said that you have to like lean in and it's almost like they they pull you in in the same way that like you're going through those like small corridors in the film you know the small corridors of the spaceship and like you feel that like you know %HESITATION tents claustrophobia it's like you have to lean into that that piece of tech yeah I read it yeah I know and you feel that tenseness yep yeah that was all about the film and the poster now it's time for did you know Stewart  I'm gonna Paul dies in advance because I'm gonna murder this person's name and if your first some reason watching this video I am so sorry but  blue eyes he bought by day whole  who who is the person who actually played the alien was a graphic designer  well %HESITATION he was seven feet one inches tall %HESITATION day and he had a thin arms which perfectly allowed him to fit in the alien suit what  it's pretty well %HESITATION yeah they can in the standing desk sitting down my gosh holy smokes  fox agreed to double the budget of the film on the strength of Ridley Scott storyboards alone  the massive space jockey one of the most memorable set pieces from the film was accidentally destroyed when someone left a lit cigarette on it causing it to catch fire and burn down  says everything about the film and the poster now it's time  friend now let's check the border that focuses your eye on the actual content of the poster is reminiscent of what framing technique is a hit it's French  thanks everybody this was an episode of
