for  so to introduce myself %HESITATION my name is Molly necks I am a senior product designer at uber and I'm here to talk to you today about how we're designs for the future of transportation specifically about the challenges that come with designing for a scale that so massive it's changing the way that city's move it's %HESITATION providing jobs for people around the world and completely reimagining the concept of logistics  so  quick question to the audience how many of you have ever taken and you perform  yes so another raise of hands but this time different  how many of you have ever driven with the over before  yeah okay but it looks like way less of you dramatically %HESITATION and up until a year and a half ago when I started to where I was like most of you where I had limited exposure of what the driver experience was like  but a lot of my work at uber has been on the driver partner side and %HESITATION my jobs my team's job is to create experiences to facilitate this new type of work that the world has never seen before  the focus of what I talk about today is gonna be techniques and approaches for unpacking a complex problem space building true and deep empathy with your users especially in context that you might not be familiar with and being sure that you're solving the right  problems in the first place  now before we get into this I want to take this chance %HESITATION introduce myself who am I specifically over %HESITATION and why am I here to talk to you today  so I mentioned before I'm Molly I work on the driver partner experience that you were as well as at the advanced technologies Group  and then in the spirit of saying one non work thing about myself as an ice breaker  I also have applied that background in design to one of my personal interests which is making furniture  and the best way to for me to disconnect because I stare at a screen all day at my job is to go out and make things with my hands %HESITATION so throughout my talk I'm gonna be doing a little bit of metaphor making to show how really this type of process and approach can be applied to a broad range of projects and contacts so that hopefully all of you regardless of the type of design that you practice can takes a few take away a few lessons learned  so let's get into it %HESITATION I'm gonna talk about work she guidelines on for what it takes to design at uber and all of us in this room as designers can take forward in the work that we do every day  the important thing to note here is that there's not a one size fits all approach to design process %HESITATION but this is a rough set of principles and guidelines to help drive your process uber style  so let's start off with the first one starting small and scaling it quickly  uber started in two thousand ten as a simple idea push a button and get a ride  the goal is to make  technology invisible and have a magical experience that transports you from here to there  and over began only six years ago %HESITATION and that's what it looks like as a service for a hundred friends in San Francisco to get luxury rides and before over acts which is the more economical service that we offer %HESITATION and launched in two thousand twelve taking an uber men's that you were going somewhere in San Francisco for something more than thirty dollars  but this simple idea introduces the first layer of complexity when designing over over is a two sided market place  riders use over as a platform to get them where they need to go and then drivers use over as a source of income on the flexibility of being your own boss with your own hours on your own terms and from a product perspective this RD means that you have two different experiences to design in this case mobile apps with two very different needs and requirements for both  you seem to almost we know about the writer side so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about the partner out and it seems like a lot of you are less familiar with that  so the rock which is for drivers %HESITATION enables a driver partner to tell you word that they're ready to drive to get new trip requests to tell them where the writer is to get them to where the writers going and then to do that all over again until they've decided that they were done for the day  and the very first partner up wasn't really  anything crazy or complex %HESITATION so there is a request  and that's where the writer is  that's kind of about it but with this straightforward system uber started to expands dramatically in  and in this visualization you can see the day a day of trips in New York on two thousand fourteen compared to two thousand fifteen even for years and took over being in New York thirty continues to grow at a dramatically fast pace so as rights increased so did our opportunity to think about how to make a more efficient system as a whole  in this visualization you can see that the by the bright lines that many people are taking the same trip at the same time  so this observation begs the question how might over play a role in reducing congestion in our cities  and then another reserve hands are how many of you have ever taken over pool before  looks like let's see I don't think it's here in Santiago so hopefully  %HESITATION in two thousand fourteen report came on the scene and over Paul makes it easy for people who are going the same place at the same time to share a ride and it's all about getting more people into fewer cars and making cheaper rights for passengers and then also longer trips for drivers and less congestion in our cities  so we're dealing with the growing complexity of the product itself and it dramatically increase scope and  all of the problem but all of this house the need to maintain a simple clear you why inside the apps that we have for both writers and for driver partners  on the drive a partner sites specifically those challenges come with questions like how we design an interface that's clear enough for a driver to get around the city in order to know where to go and pick up riders a drop off writers can currently without ever really looking at the watch  so was expanding our reach in markets that we already operate and but meanwhile Hoover is rapidly expanding around the globe  so today actually Brazil is in uber's top five biggest biggest businesses after the US and India sao Paulo is our big arms aren't suppose number to Mexico City is the biggest and busiest river city in the world  we are in six continents in in seventy two countries  I'm in Silicon Valley at least designers tend to fall prey to designing with the more technology for consumer in mind it designs tend to emphasize the latest trends or the latest interaction paradigms and while users of all kinds exist in the U. us usability issues are magnified in markets like India where a lot of our drivers who drive with uber and are given a smartphone when they first start and this smartphone is the first ever smartphone that they've used  so without global expansion also comes a range of U. acts challenges specifically a growing range of time  nickel proficiency varying literacy rates and with designs it's even more important that clarity take precedence over cleverness and that every afford ins and reduction of tax %HESITATION goes a long way to making sure that our interfaces are clear and usable to all of our users  so we've seen this global scale change and I'm massive growth %HESITATION so let's see this all together and all walk you through what it ripple trip is like trying to voice over video so let's go  so you start driving you get any request  dot and now you go to pick up George  Dr arrive George gets in your car and you start his trip  now your driving you get a new request and this is actually another writer who's been match that's taking you about the same way that George was going and so you go pick them up  that slightly change the route that you're going to take  so you go  you pick that writer up they get in your car and you start that trip and then you go to drop your job and then he gets on the car and then you drop that second writer all  and is this process continues so you drop the second minor all now you get a new request another one you drop off a drop off another request an apple continues until you are done for the day  so well that is quite a difference between not one dimensional functionality that we started out with to this extensible trip framework that scales to include many different trips and tasks and actually this only scratches the  because of the complexity that a lot of our partners have to deal with we also do things like food delivery or actually in Santiago pass trips %HESITATION which definitely adds the complexity that our partners doing while they're using this device in their car  so showing this gradual growth and transition is the first lesson in today's talk about the process of design and product development uber starting small and scaly quickly  and I mentioned before about how I'm going to make furniture metaphors on so I'll tell you how this applies to making furniture as well %HESITATION you don't have to be a carpenter to build furniture you have to start small and slowly builds our skills over time I am a amateur novice printer maker  so as pictured here my first piece was me going to the beach picking up a piece of wood and sticking up plants into it and I called art and then I went to a ball woods shop where I found a scrap wood been in a really nice piece of walnuts so I send about down put some water oil on it and then it was a cutting board  and then making a dining room table was kind of just like a really big cutting board covered in concrete %HESITATION and so it's all about the theme with me in building furniture is that I don't have a shot which I see as a design constraints %HESITATION and my skill set is pretty limited himself talked about no formal training %HESITATION but I try to just keep Takhli bigger and bigger projects so how can you make sure you're moving bigger and bigger in the right direction  that question brings us to our next section which is designing the right  thing and this is different from designing the thing right I have no idea if that's going to translate well %HESITATION so a lot of very smart people actually in this room included have come up with very smart remarks to think about design process on one of the ones that we use it over as a technique called double diamonds %HESITATION and I'll explain that a little bit for those who are not familiar with it but this was developed by the British design council and it can be summarized as two diamonds the first diamond is where you design the right thing which is the section in this talk and this time and is where you the execution stage and this is where you design the thing right or you create the outcome  and the first important point is that there is no one size fits all approach to design process as I mentioned before but it's important for designers to develop a robust problem solving tool kit for problem identification and problem solving  so back to furniture really quickly for a second when you start with a blank space the opportunities are limitless there's a hundred different things you could do and a thousand questions you should be asking  who lives here what is the space use for who will be using the space and the way that I approach furniture and design for myself is not because it's a hobby for me it's really actually always for myself and it's great because it's one of those places that I can truly be selfish with the work that I do %HESITATION which is definitely not the case when you're designing for context like uber we're very likely the user is very different from your cell  so how do you start to understand who this person is and what they need  one of the strongest attributes and designer can have is the ability to observe have empathy and then translate those insights into designs that solve problems rooted in use by human need  and I'm gonna talk about Sri math is that who were designers and researchers use to gain understanding and empathy which involves getting into the shoes of the cars and even sometimes inviting users into become designers themselves  and the first one is true participation and this is getting into your user shoes as much as possible and %HESITATION this is me %HESITATION I am actually going out driving picking up real over passengers and recording my experience for my team so that they can share the insights that I've gained from doing that an outside of talking to our users one of the most powerful tools that we have our disposal is becoming drivers ourselves  so %HESITATION this is not just me that does that %HESITATION designers PM's engineers many different roles that you were go out and they all drive and they all pick up passengers so they can truly learn what using the product is life first hand from the driver's perspective and this allows us to truly build empathy with our driver partners and internalize the pain points and seek opportunities to improve the product  personally from driving I have felt like what it feels like  to be waiting outside your writers pick up spot on a busy dark road with four lanes of traffic around you risking getting a ticket and you know in this context that there's truly no way that you can be asked to focus on a phone in a difficult situation like this yesterday we heard Laura martini talk about the importance of high contrast and intentional use of color in the context for designing for healthcare systems %HESITATION and how she looks to airplane cockpits as a source of inspiration for guiding principles of clear powerful design that same idea definitely applies to designing for driving and it's these principles that we theoretically know to be true when we're sitting at our desks and designing on a screen %HESITATION but when you're driving in a pop up appears with three small lines of tax and there's absolutely no way that you can read that because you have two eyes on the road that's how we internalize these principles for to optimize for designing for driving and so this is all great but as it turns out you also or not the user so how else can you bring participation into your design process  and that is bringing your users directly into your design process actually we heard were not over do go talk about this this morning where you tube uses a similar approach for on treating your users as stakeholders in the design process and recently to drive our future direction of the recorder experience we invited driver partners into our brainstorming we had them up with designers and tell us what there is  choose were enjoyable moments and then actually participate in their own sketching and idea generation workshop so they can design features for us and by involving driver partners in our process we were able to inject everything from their broader thoughts their issues and product ideas directly into the beginning of the design process and then we have their stories and their insights guiding us throughout the entire process and so all of those early decisions around design direction or shape to directly from them  and so on the other end of the spectrum true observation is going out and being a fly on the wall  in general when you do research it's often recruiting is a difficult and time consuming part of research process  %HESITATION and so an amazing thing about uber %HESITATION is that it's one of the only services that I can think of where we essentially have something that is push a button and get our participants %HESITATION all of a sudden a driver partner pulls up and this is really really powerful when you have a quick question or on a concept to validate  and when I ride in cars I actually try not to mention that I work for over not in any nefarious way but rather it's better to get a raw unbiased perspective from the people who were trying to solve problems for without it being under the pretense of Hoover sponsored research where you're subject to get different answers  I'm so finally kind of bringing these two concepts together on one on one interviews with driver partners is also a very common technique that we use  I'm gonna talk about a specific project where we just  recently we were looking at ways to help on people who are new to driving with uber get started and prepared to get on the road  we talked to dozens of new driver partners in both the US and in China to try to learn first hand what questions they have when they were first starting out  and beyond just asking questions %HESITATION we ended up taking it a step further and actually took their first real uber trip with them with us as passengers so we can observe directly what issues they would actually have on their first real trip  so once we had all this initial data what do we do next  in addition to that foundational research directly with driver partners we %HESITATION reach out to the operations teams around the world so operations are the eyes and ears in every city that uber operates and they're here in Santiago and they're the ones who work tirelessly to make uber run and operate in every city that number is an  and so we want to see what they were doing to help onboard new driver partners and what they were doing to teach them how the driving experience works we ask them what product opportunities they thought would best serve this problem and I do not our reach we actually ended up getting one resounding feature requests from around the world  and this was to build a practice trip in the partner up and so that what they wanted is a way for a driver partner to kind of get in their car and goes  %HESITATION real over trip except without ever picking a passenger up  and this is a great idea there's no no downside but there's one actual key issue with this idea and when you think about what a practice trip is it would mean that you're actually behind the wheel and you're seeing a brand new out for the first time in that context and going back to our research actually our research showed that %HESITATION a new driver partner got fairly easily overwhelmed when they were actually behind the wheel and asked to both drive and learn something new at the same time so this is because they're saying it out for the first time it's brand new and then also all of that difficulty I mentioned before about having four lanes of traffic around you %HESITATION that's not the time to learn something new  so from this our guiding principle for our design process was that when you're actually driving should not be the first time that you're ever exposed to brand new your new you why and a brand new concept that you haven't seen before  so instead we actually read wanted to re focus to a key question which is what is the real problem we're trying to solve with the solution and a big scene that we've heard of this conference and actually Alex so sorry %HESITATION mention in her talk about chasing problems is that it's important to be problem first and not solution first %HESITATION and let's sing that in for a second because it's such an and drive a driving force for the work that we do every day problem first not solution first  so  if you look at this practice trip idea it was actually a solution to two different problems  one is that a driver partner did not have a clear understanding of how a trip on uber worked  and then too once they're in the car they're absolutely overwhelmed by brand new you why in a brand new contacts and everything that they theoretically learned when they were out of the car did not  doesn't doesn't retain  so to address that we refocus the problem space into two different parts one is how do we design and experience that prepares a new driver for what a triple entail my teaching them the mechanics of power trip on uber works and then support them as they actually start to drive and they're on there for several trips  it's important to realize that complex problems don't often come with single solutions and understanding the context of the users and or the journey that they've taken to get there is the key to unlocking the service design challenges  so on this is a life overview of that how we impact this problem space and I'll talk about how this project played out a little bit but I wanted to take a second to talk about %HESITATION how to get the the importance of getting buy in from your team  and so  ultimately on design is just a way of solving problems designers researchers product managers engineers data scientists you name it marketing operations and actually whatever titles that all of you in this room house on everyone should be a part of the design process  better work and better products will be the results so design is really just the process in which you were billed products and if design was simply seen as a stage in the %HESITATION process maybe coming in later it would inherit all of the decisions made prior to the design starting which we refer to in the industry as putting lipstick on a pig  so the best thing that you can do to get this by and %HESITATION empathy from your teammates is actually have them along for the ride and in this case quite literally %HESITATION when a researcher and I brought one of our engineers and our team into the car with us so that he could see what the experience was like first hand that he was building on what you actually can't see in this picture is he also has his laptop with him and he's actively for Kate fixing bugs as he sees them while the cars driving also just we like to think of  %HESITATION so at burger we are lucky to work alongside engineers that care enough about the just product that they're building to want to come along to do that so it means that they care enough to want to learn what the research process is like and so even when doing things like small scale usability studies having our roles like engineers or product managers directly observe and maybe asking them to be the note takers of the session ensures that we're building empathy across the organization  so okay next action so now that you have a solid understanding of the problem space you've talked your users give a clear  articulation of the problem that you're going to solve your whole team is bought into this process now is the time to actually start the part of the design process that most people consider design %HESITATION so how do you start  %HESITATION that so how do you start that with furniture  the first lesson is to find any way that you can to produce tiger solution and you want to try to learn as much as possible without investing resources turn it into building something that might not work so take a piece of wood put it on a chair out of cardboard box you want to feel the space and start to understand %HESITATION sort of a deeper level of understanding of what the outcome should look like  only then do you go out and you find the right materials you make decisions around styling and then you build that you put into place and you would just  so that's the  beautifully over simplified version I try to follow and making furniture but going back to the actual over part of the process in number inevitably by now you have some sort of idea of what you want to build and so this is where you start to explore a broad range of possibilities and design directions and the best way to do this is actually quite simple it's just start somewhere and make something  so some designers prefer to start on a notebook sketching on paper others hop right into their favorite program and make wire frames and you're really crazy you dive into high fidelity prototyping and there's no right answer with this stuff but the only guideline is out the bra  %HESITATION the scope of the problems the last fidelity you should probably start with so from an early concept for example starting with the high fidelity solution might get you feedback on things like visual treatment but when you're really looking to get feedback on the broader concept it's best to kind of take a step back and use more of a wire frame pathology  so relating to fidelity let's bring it back to that project about helping new drivers start out with the uber  so in this second part which is about supporting drivers through their first real trip we want to figure out what information is important to help new drivers when they're actually doing a trip for the first time  and from all that base knowledge about designing for driving we knew that we had to reduce the amount of complexity on the screen and then keep elements that are important like the map which is telling the driver where to go  but the idea and bear with me for a second is that we want to create turn by turn navigation except for you why so kind of like how a voice speaks out and tells you to turn right at the end of the road %HESITATION but for buttons on the screen so also in principle kind of similar to the types of coach marks that you might see on the screen when you first open up an out for the first time it tells you how a button works or how to move forward in a flow  in this case you're learning something well you have two hands on the wheel and two eyes on the road and it's important to maintain that and you're also in a context where you're already listening to your phone telling you what turns to make  so that was the idea it was art instruction like slide  green bar to start the trip at the screen in which that step appears this reminds them how to use this brand new you why and what to do at each step in the flow  so the question becomes how do we build something that we can learn from quickly  from our valuation research sessions we knew we wanted everything to work exactly as a normal trip would accept with this extra added component %HESITATION voice  so we got a little bit creative advertising methods %HESITATION we use the actual partner up I sat in the backseat of a car with a laptop and I read out the instructions that we thought would be good at each step in the trip flown %HESITATION this is great because it required no real design work it was literally just in Prague  so we have the standard list of instructions that we identified based our initial foundational research but this format %HESITATION give us the flexibility if there was a specific moment that a participant was having trouble with I could improvise and just added a new line of instruction text and then try to evaluate its performance without specific driver partner  then we can use that instruction for all of the %HESITATION kind of following participants that we had in our research studies  so what did we learn from all this the faster that you get your ideas in contact with the real world the faster you can find out what is wrong with them and then improve them so low fidelity prototyping even as easy as that wizard of oz technique that I just showed you is the easiest way to get this quick feedback that you're looking for without investing a lot of upfront resources  it's also important to note that sort of prototyping how  as in many different shapes and sizes it's common for designers to think that a prototype means something that you quoted up in framer or you put together in principle but really %HESITATION you want something that gets the information that you're needing at the fidelity of question that you want to answer so dear it's all about kind of asking what information are you actually looking for with that prototype that you're building  and now I'm going to switch gears a little bit and talk about a different project where we learn key insights later in the process when we're out more of a high fidelity stage  so  one and half years ago the driver design team set out to tackle a ground up redesign of the partner out  so far in this talk I've been talking about the part of the partner experience what happens when you're in the car we we call on track but this project focuses specifically on everything that happens when a driver partners out of the car or not on trips so the goals of this project were to take the opt for us something with limited functionality which was essentially going online taking steps and inviting friends took over on to becoming the one stop shop for managing your business and this included a whole new addition and set of functionality such as checking your earnings or on monitoring your feedback from your writers  so we want to make sure we were designing %HESITATION information architecture that reflects most what's most important to partners and not the organization that we design within so through research we identified the four key buckets the first one is  %HESITATION knowing when and where to drive and getting timely information and this is the home town then tracking your earnings and finding out about opportunities to earn more and this is the earnings Tom then getting feedback from your writers and learning how you can improve this is the ratings time and then finally managing all of your information and this is in the account tab  so our process for arriving on overall ABS and structure after the initial problem framing and foundational research was complete was to start with wireframes exploring a vast number of possible design directions and then we conducted weekly interviews ability so these this one looks like it was conducted in a prison but over the course of a month where we would put the latest designs of the prototype whether it be a piece of paper with a screen shot on it or cool tap through on interactive prototype  I think we put each prototype in front of driver partners to get their feedback and we learned a lot and change all lots during this process but one of our blind spots in this process was that we end up limiting our research pretty much to driver partners in California  so as I mentioned before uber is this massive global products and this is a direct violation of the guideline that I gave earlier in the presentation which was designed global first so we learned a lot from this miss half but when we finally ended up taking a prototype to India fairly late in the process the moment we put it in front of users we learn interesting insights related to the visual details that drastically change the initial understanding of the U. Y. itself so I'll give you  a little bit of background about  as mentioned before driver partners in India have never a lots of driver partners in India have never used a smart phone before the one that they use to drive with uber  in addition to this driver partners in India have varying literacy rates or are able to read in their local language but maybe not in English which is actually the default that most of the phones that they use are set to  so often driver partners in India rely much more heavily on iconography in order to memorize where features are are located within the out and so this poster is actually something that's posted in the %HESITATION onboarding center in on the boat India and what you can see here is that that is an English it has kind of call outs in Hindi and then labels in good dropping it which is the local language and %HESITATION that state so you can see that they're also kind of struggling with this %HESITATION %HESITATION way so it kind of a communique what we need to to have partners with varying literacy rates  so on top of all of this issue of language and understanding drivers in India also deal with frequent network connectivity issues which is a really challenging if your job is to drive around and get requests on your phone that fundamentally depends on having a network connection so  we have earnings sorry we had a home earnings ratings accounts and we not the iconography already use this was helpful because %HESITATION driver partners in India also often %HESITATION visual and  lion visuals to use so  %HESITATION show this designed to driver partners India and then almost unanimously driver saw  the second tab from the left was where they would go to manage their network settings and that seemed really random toss Americans who usually we only use it you lose network connectivity if for off hiking or in a tunnel so why did they think this is for network settings there's two real reasons one is because network connectivity is top of mind for drivers in that region and also the icon that we selected looks like but network settings bar so also the second reason is that things like bar charts don't communicate well turned to drivers in the market it's not a relatable way to communicate that earnings information because bar charts you require kind of a non math education to understand  so we change the icon to be a more clear literal interpretation of money rather than an abstract representation of a bar chart  and in this case where you really seemingly small detail like an icon selection when combined in the context of a low network connectivity environments and having really drastic impact on the clarity of are you why and it's in moments like this where designing the thing right becomes increasingly important  so %HESITATION this is the part of a talk also where we start to talk about the other part that people think is most of the design process which is making things move making things pretty or my favorite description making things pop %HESITATION and this is on a very important part of the design process as this is what sets are products of part is your brain  and it's the feeling people how when they're using your product and how does over talk about that  so %HESITATION were lives by this traditional mantra useful usable desirable and we end up talking on one extra element which is made with love so this is where delights  don Norman how to Ted talk in two thousand three where he talked about sort of the three components of a motion that concert to light the first one is visceral and this is the initial impact of the experience the second one is behavioral and this is what the total experience and performance and then the third one is reflective and that's how the product makes you feel  and what I love most about this framework is that it adds a weights and a dimension to part of design that %HESITATION we as designers kind of know and feel but ultimately it's hard to quantify in a lot of times the people that we work with every day that a little bit more may be skeptical about the value of delights in design %HESITATION it it adds weight to that I'm kind of concerned so what are some of the ways that %HESITATION were things about to light  our branding and our videos like this are examples of how we achieve visceral delight in the work that we do for product design and through branding it's beautiful it's emotional it's elevated it wow is you with its movement and its dynamics and elevates the feeling of the product itself  so another progressive has actually %HESITATION how many you have ever experienced over ice cream  cool okay less severe so I wasn't sure if that would  the thing that people knew %HESITATION over ice cream is an example of behavioral delights %HESITATION and this actually this videos from right here in Santiago which is kind of why I asked many of you have actually seen it before %HESITATION and for those not familiar this is %HESITATION one day a year when Hooper turns into push a button and get ice cream delivered around the globe and so beyond the visceral packaging design and the Q. decals on the cars fundamentally what scenario could be more delightful than pushing a button and having ice cream delivered to your doorstep  so that said actually judging by all the jackets in this video I think we can make it a little bit more delightful if we change the season that it runs  so %HESITATION then we can move on to reflected the light and this is how the entire product makes you feel and we like to make think of the entire experience as an example of this so reflective is a type of delight where you know your life is better because you have the flexibility to earn income that works within your schedule  or the type of delight that %HESITATION you can feel that knowing where ever you go you have a safe reliable ride home and it extends far beyond what we typically think of when we think of delight but it's perhaps the most important value that we as designers and as product creators can deliver  so now back to our process I promise this last section shorter %HESITATION once you have your project ships it's solving problems it's delighting users around the globe and millions of people are using it every day %HESITATION you're all done right  can go home job job completes no %HESITATION you have to do it all over again so in any in house design team you also have to be comfortable %HESITATION doing it all over again even as soon as your design is out the door so the way that you learn is never been afraid to go back to design the right thing stage which is where you take what you just launched and then question all of the initial assumptions that you made at the beginning of that process because likely the world has changed in the time it took you to build that thing in the first place  so in the world we operate in the design you make today will likely not be here in a year from now and almost certainly will not be here five years from now so despite launching a brand new partner up last year we already are thinking about ways to tear it all down and prove it once again given all the insights that we've gained in the last year and the beauty of working in a context where you have full control over the design outcome is that you can go back and reassess and re evaluate all the decisions that you made prior and this is actually one of my favorite things about working on an in house design team purses an agency because it allows you to help full control of the product after you've delivered at  so one more example of furniture in this case ceramics on their projects which you will not always get right the first time so the one on the left is the first cop that I ever made I did not mean for it to look that way the colors are wrong the shape is lopsided but you know you do it over again the next one's closer still some issues and then finally about third attempt probably gets a little bit closer to what you're going for and %HESITATION  so all these cups are serving their needs their holding coffee real smoothly we wanted to look at sort of the entire entire Cup journey of all aspects of delights  so  wrap this up on went over things of terms like service design %HESITATION the best service transcends the whole journey
