discussed today so keep an eye on your inbox for that that's it for housekeeping without further ado I would like to present you poor Nina welcome let's start by you telling us a little bit about yourself  sure thanks everyone for joining me today and for those of you who aren't familiar with my background I actually got started have my second my second job was as the pounding engineer admin dot com and it was a great experience I was there from the very very beginning before we actually had a product and it was very fundamental in introducing me to design prior to that I really had little to no experience and had to quickly learn how to work with designers importance of design and also she is designed to really differentiate our product from what was out there in the market so I'll definitely be sharing a lot of my learnings from the experience with you today and I was basically there until the acquisition and then after the acquisition decide to strike out on my own and began building products like busy bee which is a CRM solution for fitness business sense I've also been a lecture I Duke University has most recently an entrepreneur in residence at five hundred start up  I'm during the time that I was working at meant I actually started walking on fan junior this was back in two thousand seven and I was writing my engineering entrepreneurship and around twenty thirteen I decided that I wanted to go from being a blog to a business and so today from junior is an education company and we help techniques such as yourselves build products and companies are level up in their careers  so I you know I know a number of you out there are already designers or your friend in engineers or know how to design some the goal of this at the weapon are today is not to teach you fundamentals of design or to talk about you know how to make pixel perfect designs you already know most likely got that covered what I really want to focus on is leveraging designed to differentiate so if you've already got design work that you've done or maybe there's a certain direction that you believe we should go in this is an opportunity for you to really take me out learning was that I'm giving you an item within a business contacts I know I've seen over and over again people come to me with amazing designs and you know there's always a business person that's like how does this relate so I'm I'm hoping that this will give you more ammo to deal with those conversations and so to that extent I'm gonna focus on our talking about product but I also want to talk about some of the other areas in which designers need to be involved and often aren't and it actually impacts product adoption and one of those key areas is definitely in marketing I'm in the same thing can be said about sales so I'll talk about how you want to get a little bit more involved on break down some of those marketing silos  and then the second thing I'll talk about is obviously evaluating a competitor's design but I want to say that to one of the end because I don't want you to get obsessed with what my gosh is what the competition is doing on but instead I want to show you how you can take the time to evaluate it and then position where product against what's already out there so that you appear stronger this is really critical especially if you are a start up or you're a growth phase I you're dealing with like an eight hundred pound gorilla I know really large company that's been around for a long time and has a lot of entrenched our branding and and people are just drawn to it because they might be the leaders in a particular category so it's a good idea to evaluate were designed versus bears and the position accordingly and then finally I'll give you a couple case studies to just drive the point home and and you can't you all the different things back a couple of these companies have done and hopefully that will teach you some lessons on what you can do and how you can actually make a big difference with your design regardless of what size you are what stage you are at your company  okay so let's start by talking a position in which I know is very different from design I'm back again when I was at an end I read this book and it was just very eye opening to me open to that point I had really read a lot about marketing I didn't really understand how to position products and how to build them but I didn't know what is going to take to differentiate so I read this book and one of my favorite quotes from the block because what our reasons basically saying is that you know as innovators we always feel like we need to build something new it needs to be cutting edge what really that's not what people want on what they want is to understand that there is a new spin on what already exists and then it's up to us to make the links so that people understand how this new thing is or better from the old thing and if we look at examples today in the market on all the products that exists today have been a new innovation Google was not the first search engine and the iPhone was not the first on mobile device so we know that there have been a lot of refinements and is this the smaller innovations that actually make a difference Black Rock people to understand how our product is different you know we have to bridge the gap we have to make those connections for them  so I'm gonna talk a little bit more about positioning on and then you bring it back into design so if you think about positioning there are basically five ways in which you can position product price is always what people start with because they are either going after and neglected customer segment needing a luxury or meeting %HESITATION inexpensive product but I often tell people not to start with price because when you start with Christ actually into commoditizing your product so we're not going to focus on price but know that that is a tactic on the second is promotion now how do you get out there and talk about your product during you you grow marketing do you get out there and make you know infomercials how do you how do you actually promote your products is another technique I'm thirty distribution you know are you in a retail store are you online I'm so these are three techniques that you can use a what I'm gonna focus on obviously the last you can not competition how you position yourself versus the competitor as well as packaging and in our world design is basically catching  so I don't know how many of you out there are like need by if you grew up in the late nineties and early two thousands probably walked into something like a compu serve or passed by and you stop products like this on the shelf writings were what I like to call shrink wrapped software and what was interesting is you know there were just a few players because getting retail space is hot is difficult and it's also expensive and so what this why don't you wise clunky software and as a result you know these companies could just keep putting out in a small update every year we would go in and buy these products but we don't really have any say in terms of %HESITATION the should be like better design it was just what's out there we buy it me I'm package it we install it on and then you probably remember that there were things like user manuals right open up a box it would be probably like a twenty page guide you have to read through to know how to install your product how you run it and you know how to use it so these were sort of older artifacts and what's been interesting is that  now that the model has changed you know we've gone from shrink wrapped software shoes socks models software as a service %HESITATION we distribute software online it means that more people can distribute it and it also means that there's more competition and a lot of competition especially in the last five to ten years I've been around design and you see this not just in consumer products but they're also enterprise companies now that are realizing the importance of design and how usability is actually going to transform the way that their products get adopted and so what I always say is no there's there's more than one group that's demanding ease of use certainly there are that gets your millennials who have grown up with products like Facebook and Snapchat and demand that things be easy but there's also baby boomers have just gotten tired with those clunky shrink wrap solutions and they want something that's also push button the same damn time  so a lot of D. %HESITATION need for design has come out of the demand for ease of use but that's actually not the primary I know a lot of conversation has been revolving around it there's been this rebirth in in design which is great but I would say there's actually something that's more important dandy ease of use and while this is important it should actually be on a secondary in terms of priorities and that's actually trust so when we think about trust what I mean by it is we're doing business online and we're no longer in a brick and mortar place where people can come up to ask ask questions or pick up the phone and how best to provide them support they really got it have a level of trust when they're using our product and so to that extent our eyes out position that we really have to think about how we're going to develop back  and part of the reason you know you might wonder like why is trust so important you know who cares if people don't like a product like move on right well the reason is risk right there's a lot of risk that people are taking when they purchase products or use products online I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with no element of fraud there's a lot of father goes on online on but there's also people who want to know that when they use your product their good experience away and that might be in their personal life or it might be in a business context and so anytime they're evaluating your product against competitors or against you know not even using the product they're wondering how is this going to impact either my bottom line or my personal security or you know is going to make me stand out  and so we've got to think about those elements as we are positioning our product  and the %HESITATION again another great quote from one of the sales trainers and says the reason that we have to think about risk is because all people want to like sit down and look at your features and understand the benefits it's an emotional reaction that they're having and so for them risk is that emotional reaction and you have to be able to connect with them in order for them to be willing to take that risk and use your product  so this is become you know one my favorite mantras when it comes to designing any product that is going to be distributed online %HESITATION whether it's you know software or something else and not you know repeat after me like I must build trust build trust they'll track you can never stop building trust on because it's basically how you retain users how to attract new ones and it's also how you keep people hooked in your products  so when I talk about trust a lot of times you will think okay well we just got it you know make everything secure war make everything look good and people will trust us right well I would argue that it actually is a lot more you really want to take a holistic view of building trust and this is where I think a lot of on the ammunition for designers high you can you can take this and use that in a business contacts because if you can explain to the stake holders that look you know in order for us to get that our adoption we have to have users trust us and they're going to understand that we're not going to be like no we don't want to do things in a chain right I'm so to that extent what it means is as the signers not just involved in product we were actually involved in the entire experience this comes back to that whole element of branding right so it's about the landing page when people come it's your front door so whatever your landing site is what is the experience they have there what is the information how does it look how can the interactive  and then the second phase is definitely a product phase if they've decided to sign up what does the onboarding look like and how can you give them a positive first time experience  and then the third is obviously ongoing experience so customer support teens know how are they responding what kind of %HESITATION what boys are they using how are they navigating people through the product all of that is important and the final is providing that ongoing value so I would say you know as designers you wanna you wanna put your house on again and use design thinking to help with the whole experience and that I think is training that you uniquely have that you know engineers pianos and other people in the company may or may not have because no one group meeting focused only on like shipping another group are the focus on functionality on but as designers your goal is to bridge the gap between that the person who's actually using the product as well as you know how you make them feel in that experience  so the first thing I always tell people to start with is your landing page that's where you start to build your trust again it's that front door and so when people come to your landing site what did they get out of it  I am so part of that is you know it doesn't folks get really obsessed with conversion like what's our conversion what's our conversion and what they don't realize is that conversion basically comes down to not just you know what you say on your site bought the overall design of the aesthetic and house more that is to the product as well as the copy that they use you know their voice and their town and again this is where we can't just leave the work opt you are marketing team because a lot of times they can come to sales me or it can be this sort of thing where they just any tax the hell out of town %HESITATION but they're not really developing a deep connection with the customers and so it's important to take the time to be involved in that process  and so we talk about a landing page you probably heard this over and over again so I realize I'm by like a hundred person that's hang this on but it's important that you list out the benefits of your product you know what is it that's going to do what's the value that it's delivering and not the features again seen a lot of times when marketers are given free rein it always comes down to like %HESITATION what we have X. Y. and Z. feature and then it's a it's a matter check boxes verses and the competitors but we should take the time to actually define the benefits it creates a clearer picture in terms of what the end user is going to experience rather than %HESITATION you know they're missing this like one particular feature  and the second is in the area of security and privacy and this is so often overlooked and it's amazing %HESITATION people feel like %HESITATION you know we have the second version what does what the security and privacy matter I would say it actually matters a lot especially depending on the type of product you're creating your doing anything if it's in the financial services healthcare social networks are I would say people really want to know that there are some level of community moderation or some level of privacy in terms of you know your own on detached and that things are gonna be Capstick your and I always see these convoluted no security and privacy plates and pages that I don't know who they're intended it I know it's just legal means by I don't know who they're intended to make feel better so it's important to take the time to explain know how your product and how you as a company value people's security and privacy  think about who is going to use your product and explain more about what I need by that on  is really what I'm getting at is it's important to give people a sense of who your customers already are so you can attract other customers that are like that  in the final I hear a lot of you know when when you are designing landing sites many pages there always concerned back out appealing to multiples personas and what I would say is it's not actually about multiple personas it's about who is the decision maker and if there are multiple decision makers and you need to make sure that there's enough information to address their concerns  so let's start by talking about the value proposition right this is again where we want to focus on benefits and not the features and so what that means is what's the first time experience going to be like when the customer uses the product you know what's the win button can give back  so here's an example of you know Airbnb friend in page and you see here that you're very clearly I'm coming to this site for the very first time the wind that I'm gonna experience is having a comfortable bad in a place that feels like home and if I don't experience that I'm probably gonna write a bad review if I experienced that heck I'm gonna read also review I'm gonna tell my friends about it and no word is gonna spread right so it's important to give back element that emotional first time experience in the landing page so you you see here it's not things like %HESITATION you know can I book a place in Hawaii or you know how to their team at work or you know it doesn't get into all the nitty gritty details are really just pulling in with me first hand experience  now you probably so yeah I saw here from people saying like what about teachers not so important right they're gonna ask us questions they want to know we have all these bells and whistles  and what I would say is having something very high level is good certain how the how it works section with just two or three or just a few few ways in which your product works then that's enough when you get into the nitty gritty of features that's where again war product gets compared to other competitors products it's also where people get tripped up is asking you one thousand one questions you know they get really into the minutia and at some point you know they'd lose focus of why they were there looking at your product and looking at your landing site  so here's a great example but I took from calling me and how many will use callin me on it's basically a way to soccer schedule and what ball easily Bach and I just love the simplicity of this because they're not sitting here telling you out here all the features we offer you know integration and we do this and they're just saying what you start by setting your preferences and use another link and then people can at themselves and they've basically taken away all of any new shot and kept it really high level so that people just have a sense of okay I see how this works you know maybe I have some more questions you know go to the faqs page but from a high level I understand that the point of this product is to helping with scheduling and to kind of get rid of that back and forth when I'm having a schedule with somebody else  so we will call this a lot word of mouth is really really powerful and it's very hard though as an online %HESITATION product or in as fast product to get that word of mouth going despite what we silent despite having Twitter and Facebook and all the social media %HESITATION it's still hard because it comes back to that element of trust right people aren't necessarily going to believe everybody online they want to know that %HESITATION they're actually been successful customers have used your product and so when it comes to a word of mouth testimonials can be pretty powerful what what I often times is testimonial that either don't really make sense or don't really cap sure who the end user is an art relatable so whoever you take a testimonial from make sure that that user is representative of the type of users that you want to continue to interact with no other people that you want to convert into customers and so to that extent we're gonna make sure that there is an element of relating on and it's almost it does kind of funny like saying you know any downturn that people will see that this is realistic  so here's a great example but I talk from skill crash you'll see here about Charlotte Baker you know went through their program and she's you know she's using her own words and she says stuff like I'm not exaggerating when I say skill crash changed my life and so I was somebody who is reading this I'm gonna think %HESITATION I wonder how it changed her life okay well it looks like wow she was fired from a job she hated you know how many of us never had that experience I know about you but I certainly happy right this is a lot more believable on because I'm seeing this through the lens of Charlotte Baker this isn't just a company Tooting their own horn and if I want I can go on to win the war of Charlotte story but this is a great way for me to say wow this customer is just like me or my friends and it becomes a lot more relatable so this is another way can build trust on war manning site  here's another example arms companies called home care and they provide a home care assistance to the elderly again that's an industry where people really care about trust right if they're going to be having somebody come into their homes if they're going to be having them take care of their parents or family members then trust is really important and again even the imagery that they use know that looks like somebody's parent not  right and so again it pulls  and help them understand wow okay there are people who are getting assistance here and what I like about this is even the subtle team in terms of like aside the fun thing use it's pretty bank I'm not because most of the people who are signing up for elderly care are going to be the children or again the loved ones  you might also be in the middle age so it seems kind of silly but no the bigger font is actually helpful  they're also addressing the major concerns that customers have your pricing like exceptional home care is in town on eight you know go ahead and call up trust on and they talk about how valuable it is to have these people come to your home  now let's talk about the topic of multiple personas because a lot of times when people come to your landing page landing site they might have many different personas so how do you address all of those and pull them into your product  well again like I said you really want to start by thinking about how to design for the decision maker and not Michael multiple people but you want to think about it in terms of concerns  and so here's an example that I took from straight on they basically had the payment gateway for people to use it there are creating their sass products are mobile products and your number of your pretty familiar with them  what you'll notice here is given their copy they say like design of the whole company night so they know that as a payment provider they're actually impacting a lot of people in organization it's not just engineering also finance probably security and public customer support and they've taken the time to address all the concerns that each one of these groups how they talk about how they have awaits you on your provide font protection provide accounting integrations on and make it pretty push button to set up if you are the engineering team so they haven't really called out Hey if you're an engineer here click here if your finance click here but instead they realize that there's gonna be multiple people coming and looking at their site so they need to address all of their concerns because there's multiple makers  yeah same thing here with home care assistance again thank sample used before again here you've noticed they're taking a lot of time to address concerns on and they know that there's been a lot of decisions involved and so what they've done is they've said no basically white white shoes home care on and they've talked about being a trusted partner talked about how they work through cognitive therapeutics on the talk about how available they are and again these are all concerns that people have when they when they're thinking about okay should I invite somebody in to take care of my elderly relative  now we talked a lot about the winning site so hopefully that gives you a sense of the things that you need to work on and how you want to work with the marketing team %HESITATION shift gears now talk about product so that first time experience so assuming that you know your landing site was great got somebody to convert they signed up how are you then going to give them a positive first hand experience to get them hooked  so I would say you know the purpose of the landing site was you made a promise to the user inside sign up and the benefits that will touted on our landing site are gonna be the benefits that you experience in the product and so you want to make sure if you actually taking the time to %HESITATION make that make it make the parallel because a lot of times this is where the disconnect happens they go to a landing site if you like also amazing and then when nobody converts Norman either sign up but they don't actually come paying members are scratching your head %HESITATION and this is why we have to break down the silo between marketing and sales as as well as product in our lives designers on is because that's what happens you don't see the increase conversion don't see people paying for the product upgrading because they feel like they were told one thing and experience something out so that promise that you made on the landing site needs to be carried through  and so one of the ways to do that actually depending on what stage you're at is to get the customer to a win and get them to that positive first hand experience and determine what that positive first time experience is for that  and sometimes it can be as simple as like giving them something on I want to give you an example here of this company called pronoun  %HESITATION familiar with them but basically what they're doing is they're making it so that self published authors highways to sell their box on an inner providing a platform and they haven't watched yet so what was interesting is they were just building up their email last and they wanted to have something to give away and how to create that first time experiencing quite a little bit of word of mouth and so for those of you who you know may have self published you know that you have to have an ISBN number for your book to sell it on things like Amazon or wherever else can cost about a hundred hundred fifty Bucks on what what they decided to do was they decided no give our customers a first time win let's give them something and so when you sign up they basically giving you an ISBN number so you don't have to necessarily be no deep into the product it can just be a delight for first time experience  I'm actually one of my favorite quotes from Maria jeans he's been your experience on our desk now she says it's not about that minimum %HESITATION viable product it's what's the most minimum delightful product you can go out and so if that is something very simple not that's fine as long as it's going to delight your users  and to bring up example with me and I remember in the early days one of the most delightful experiences that people would have was just getting their weekly summary email or walking in and seeing all their accounts no they didn't need all the bells and whistles they were just happy they were able to connect to their bank account or credit card account and we were all their money went you know it whether they had money or not remember in dad or the you know it didn't really matter they just wanted to have that visibility and that was a really powerful experience for that in fact I still hear from some people that say you know I just look at my weekly summary and act like good enough for me I'm so it doesn't have to be this complicated Senate leaders there can be a lot of value in just a very simple first time experience as long as it's clear and obvious well designed  there's obviously going to be times and you mind experiencing this now or you might experience before where you know people for whatever reason decide that the product is it for them and they just want to leave I'm not okay because a lot of times it might be that they were expecting more it might be a mainstream customer not early adopter on or they might just decide you know now is not the time on just out of new product and Big Brother into something else so you got a first take the time to understand why they leave and this is why it's important to now connect with customer support because they're going to be the folks on your team we're gonna have the the most you know emails in terms of like cancellations stop right so you get a sense of why people are leaving and use that and then you know redesign your product resent your features are redesign your landing site and then use that information to hold them back in  so what I'll I'll tell people is it doesn't matter you know if you had customers who sign up six months ago or six years ago or whatever if you have been updating and improving our product is very important that you are sending out your yard updates I know everybody there is our our hands in the air and they're like oh my gosh we send out people unsubscribe you know it's like that's fine that's just the nature of the business but it's not telling them the improvements you've made it he's not telling them that you addressed their concerns and %HESITATION then and now you will build what they had asked for then you're missing out on an opportunity to get all those people to a doctor product so it's important is down again with your marketing team and make sure it back when you are keeping you are inactive customers are people who canceled are aware of the work that you're doing  okay so now we get to the part about competition and are giving you a lot of information here on just the element of trust building but there is really important to talk about that before we get into the competition space on because I wanted you to focus more on the things that you have control over and what you can do before you focus too much on with a competitor's doing so now let's talk about how to actually sit down and critique the competition and you know I give you this information not because you should then do it apples to oranges comparison and be like we're so much better than them but instead she uses it as a way to portray the benefits that you offer you don't have to offer in terms of contrast and then it can just be what you offer on and a lot of times customers will pick up on this on these cues and realize no who they want to use like this product one use  so the first thing is how long does it take to set up  it doesn't matter if it's a beauty product for consumer product that is always an issue for people aren't especially for consumers right they have very very little patience and so taking the time to figure out how you can at how your competitors products either push button or it's not can be really valuable if you can make your is very simple to set up then chances are you are going to adopt your prop person bears the second is you know I was there following the steps in the first time  have it easy or is it really complicated and throwing them off  and then again coming back to the competition on is their first time interaction dot in parallel with the benefits they talk about on the landing page is a lot of times %HESITATION competitors will see this over and over again and I see this morning to be to be space where they'll have all these amazing  you know reviews and they'll talk about how wonderful their product is and then when you get into the product it's clunky it takes forever to set up or there is like a really lengthy sales process or there's a contract that you have to sign and those are all things that people don't want to do but they might have just been allowed by the landing site right  so it's important to make sure that they're actually in parallel and if they're not it's a great leverage point for you to compete against online  and the last is confusion right there's always things in a product that people find confusing and it can be a point of frustration if it continues and so what are those frustrating thing was that you can avoid doing or you can provide a more delightful experience with your product and that's also what gets people to switch away from whatever product you're using today if they know it's going to be a much more delightful experience  all right now I mean any couple case studies Robison's heart with an instant  my background and I wanna explain to you how you know we thought about our adoption because for us we certainly didn't entrenching mark get as you know of a prime member there were definitely a number of incumbents in the space already and he had a number of competitors was tabi was another start up who actually launched about a year before us on quicken which was Microsoft on site which was into its product was also on the market and Microsoft money on was another product and they were getting ready to end of life their product and so when we when we started to build manage what we quickly aren't realized why is that with money they actually because they were and wiping their product not left a hole in the market for all these PC users with quick can benefit was that again never shrink wrapped and it will only servicing PC users they had actually and a wife there mac product so it meant that if we could build something for mac users we would get a portion of that market was sunny and they were really focused and more online community building and in fact they're set up was really clunky at required you to like download these files from your bank and then upload them and we were just like you know we don't think it's a good experience and so we were aware of our competitor's product but we didn't sit there and say like %HESITATION we're so much better than the other guys we just took it as a sense of okay this is what they're doing that we think is not quite right and we can provide a more holistic experience that's going to be positive  to that extent again we start off by building trust we work financial services product we're twenty somethings living in Silicon Valley was gonna trust twenty somethings with their bank information right and so is really really important to us that we took the time to build as much trust as we call it on the landing site and so we talked about things like bank level security I'm I don't know why people just trust banks despite all the stuff that happened throughout history and so we had to draw that parallel the other was that we invested in automation so we need our product push button as possible none of these like downloading files uploading it importing we just made it so that it worked and that people didn't have to worry about the set up process out on your first hand experience  the third was you know with in the product itself like I said we start with the landing page we want to make sure that the design was coherent and so we didn't want to have a pretty landing page grilling site and then %HESITATION a product it was like so so honestly major the design was consistent and that the workload kind of we have for a trust  now here's another company called a lark and for those of you who may or may not be familiar Ozark does live chat and what's interesting is again they were in a very competitive space you know there's a lot of live chat companies out there today on that provide that customer support widget commerce sites or your websites in general and so again they were thinking of it with the element of experience they were thinking how can we provide a better first time experience for our customers compared to what's on the market already and so as they didn't go into their space they realized a couple things first what they realize is a lot of the competitors it takes a long time to connect for whatever reason it just takes a long time to connect to their like support which I'm it's also really hard to scale operators and young multiple customer support people using the product on it just gets a little bit bogged down something was very slow and then some products actually required the customer to download stuff just to like connected customer support well how annoying is great %HESITATION and then there is the element of just trust and you know where you can find the customer support like you have to go and look for the contact agents always buried in and they just made it so that it sits on a portion of the website and it can be on every page so whenever people want to be able to connect with the company you can just type into the chat box  so they started off by realizing the importance was getting customers and the main set up a simple as possible they basically gave their customers three lines of code and they were like you don't need to know how to code no just cut and paste and here's how you do it and it and it actually lead to more adoption on the second thing is if you look at it you know it it looks like she'll check Anthony will might be like on a rooftop G. track %HESITATION but really what they did was they use a familiar product a familiar design winnings familiarity it actually builds credibility right people believe in global they believe that they don't do any no evil %HESITATION and so who better to you sort of mock than using Google art so that's that was actually designed on purpose  and then you'll notice at the bottom they actually put a link that says you know free %HESITATION lark life how will this actually helped with adoption it was baked in branding so the companies that would adopt their product and put them on their website they would if they decided to not %HESITATION pay for the upgrade they would basically be like free advertising so anytime a customer one of their customers came in with the %HESITATION arc and then they'd be like oh that's cool I and a lot of times %HESITATION they were also started people or our online on  as owners and so they would start to adopt them as well and the final was connecting with an operator quickly so when you're there there's just you state your operator has to be there or you have to say are off line there's no in between a state of like waiting for ten minutes to connect with somebody yeah that's that's very frustrating experience and they don't want that affiliation so they want to make sure that the whole experience %HESITATION for the end user and it may not be their customer is a positive one  okay so that basically wraps up when I wanted to talk about today and I wanna make sure I get you guys plenty of time on but in case you want more I've got a book called how to transfer ideas in this offer products back and giving out on about five hundred copies of the the first five hundred people from this weapon are you want to get it and there's a link here and since Margaret sending out the slides you will also get a link in your in box sold when I write it down and get it right now you can are going to wait until just about five that's fine tale  and then if you want even more I've got and of course coming up called ship it and it's basically going from idea to obtain prototype walking through the entire process and myself and actually a couple other designers David Catanese Jerry duty on actually to check with you all online and it's lives you get a lot of experience interacting with us and other students if you're interested you can check it out at engineer dot com slash a bit applications are actually you by the end of the week and we have a info session coming up this evening at six PM PST spell check out if you're interested  all right with that I will take it over to you Margaret awesome thank you so much so in just a moment pretty more answer questions from you guys so I encourage you to either use Twitter with the hash tag envision weapon are to ask then but also feel free to use that go to weapon our question portal to submit and if you prefer I'm so I also want to note I know a few people had some trouble getting in today we did do a full recording of this and it'll be up on our blog and either tomorrow or the day after we're gonna get that up for you quickly and just in case you missed any part of it so while we wait for some of those questions to come in want to launch a quick hold I'm and this is for those of you who are currently collaborating with six or more people in your design process we have it envisions enterprise platform is specifically designed for teens like yours so it has some really powerful features that are included in our street team our professional plans that can enable your team to position your product through design and I know are a mixed bag of folks on the call someone a spare you the details of those features if you are interested though in trying out a free trial of that enterprise platform and all those features with your team just indicate so on the survey and I'm gonna have any reach out to you to help you get set up and okay so let me keep out pull up for a few minutes while we start answering some questions  what  %HESITATION a bunch people are asking for that you are out for the book again so sorry let me yeah I know I know downloading it already  okay %HESITATION wanted to pull it up I can yeah I'll go back you got a minute closed up in right at  yeah make sure that our invasion and so that you get it for free download free  let me  all right and so Luciano had a question and he said how do you create a great landing page when there aren't just multiple personas but multiple decision makers struggling to simplify to simply articulate all the benefits and glaive give that clear CTA's for three very different types of users all on one page  yeah well I think that's a good question because this comes up a lot and I would again say it's it's about the concerns like people might have different concerns and you want to be able to address all the concerns on that one page so even if there are multiple groups coming on and you have a sense of what their concerns are you can list them out in terms of CGA I always recommend keeping it as simple as possible not the end of the day you want people to DO one maybe two things one either sign up immediately or you know give you their contact info is that you can get in touch with them if you will get more complicated than not and try to be like what you're like this person do this and then this person that it throws people off and then they're like oh well maybe I should like go talk to Bob in accounting and like get him to sign off on this and ask him to sign up right it it just it it creates too much friction so making it as simple as possible shoot collector it like there %HESITATION contact information and get them using the product is important so boil the CGA down to like one one thing needing to %HESITATION but beyond that you don't want to create K.  if you are concerned you know I hear this a lot %HESITATION that like well there's really a lot of decision makers and you just want to create a landing page her persona that's the other way to go and so you can design it at that if you're allergic to one very very specific persona you can make it start with that %HESITATION you know whatever I'm worried or whatever you know will search they're doing or however they're coming to your change is tied back to it on so that the search terms merit that change and not when you can have a very custom experience her persona so in the event that you don't want to mix them all up into one one site %HESITATION when page we can Christine back but I would not recommend you know again one thing at all and in having all sorts seeking  great advice and so he air said how did you test at mid to insure the best you axe and see axe  works customer experience okay thanks art let's get I want something if we get back %HESITATION so we are we're pretty strict about not wasting time in coming up with like a multiple iterations and any testing and all that stuff one because we're pretty small team %HESITATION but you we also felt like we should put something out there and then we had already had a pretty engaged can many of people telling us yes or no on and then quite frankly a lot of it came down to measuring engagement analytics so I remember we had and I had built a helpful this feature called are like fitness and we spent over %HESITATION couple weeks designing this thing I kind of have this gut instinct and it was getting really complicated but at the end of the day works like ship it might seem quite frankly nobody liked it and we look at the numbers it looks terrible you know we even had people coming to our blogger coming to customer support telling us like what is this thing like we don't understand it at all so we had to take the time to say okay a lot of people confused instead of continuing to put out there cause more confusion what's actually rip it out and we ended up %HESITATION just ripping out all together redirecting it so that we can act actually you only worked on and then taking the time to think through how we wanted it to to go based on some of the feedback that we received on but it was important it is kind of get something quick and dirty out there first and then get some of that negative at and I don't know if there was any politicking back in some cases there were positive feedback on but it was those faster innovation cycles that were more valuable than doing multiple iterations and then showing people okay we want a virgin or be version I can be really costly when you have a small team so that's how we %HESITATION  we kept up with the user experience and how we generated on we also kept pretty good ties in terms of what people were using a lot and that's where we like I said the weekly summary email we noticed we had such a high open rate in fact people who are opening it we're not coming back to the product and I became an issue for us because we're like but we really have like more stuff in the product right so we started to keep a close watch on on this you know court in this %HESITATION correlated behavior of what was unthinkable were using and then you know what were they not using and we did the same thing with mobile I'm gonna say we kept a really really close connection between engineering and customer support because we weren't getting a lot of acting back out this works this doesn't I and we needed to hear that back again in order to enter right so the more you can break down the silos and work with the customer support team on the more likely you are to actually give customers or what they're what they're asking for it and understand what they're getting  that's that's I think that's really important like you said and and I think that's an interesting relationship that needs to happen within a company is definitely engineering and support me to be kind of the best best friends and so dom is asked to build iOS app was it in house team or vendor and how did you choose the technology to build apps  so this was way back in the very beginning %HESITATION when I phone first came out and I can you an idea of why we chose iOS and we also had to build it in house %HESITATION because literally like I think this was two thousand seven when on the first agenda came out and we need to develop some connections apple and they said if you build your app really quickly and it's you know well cast said we will have a blue devil act in our store and we were thinking after amazing distribution channel for us %HESITATION and so we did not have things like swift we had to learn objective scene and build that will build I'm a native apps %HESITATION and that meant that we had a completely separate code bases but it went into the main code base in terms of %HESITATION you're creating a P. eyes that we get all the data out are but we did it pretty much everything in house I would not recommend I'm going forward because again it's %HESITATION were small team and so our resources became very very strapped quickly and at some point me on while we're supporting the webapp  one of our engineers who was also supporting a rap basically had to stop and focus on the tension on mobile and a couple other engineers also how to do that so we did not like think about it we were just thinking about it in terms of %HESITATION this is a great distribution channel let's give it a shot %HESITATION and because it was at the era were mobile was just getting started there were a lot of lessons like that that we had to learn on going forward you know I I might consider using an outsourced agency who knows a better or just using a platform where you can distribute across a couple on android and iOS depending on how big of an apple happened what the music just like for your customers rather than going you know doubling down just like one one  San and I know you touched on this a little bit before about can all asked what are your thoughts on eighty testing  entire or part of the landing page  yeah well I will say this overall in terms of any testing on there is no point any testing if you are just getting started so if your start up with very few users and my very few I mean less than ten thousand %HESITATION there's really no point in eighty testing because it's not gonna be as statistically significant as you think and quite frankly again you're gonna be spending a lot of time buildings to in our rations are in building like the subtle nuances and then trying to make sense of it are and what works better is actually putting one of the first generation out getting customer feedback whether it's positive or negative and then doing aeration after bigger company or let's say you've got ten thousand plus users and you decide okay now the one in the task the landing page on then I think it's it's fair but you really got to have a sense of what are you testing like what is it that you're trying to improve I'm I know a lot of people get so caught up in minutia they're like let's move this button to the left versus the right unless you know what he was %HESITATION slightly different copy on the thing you have to have a deeper understanding of what's the value proposition that we're casting and do we need to change back in each iteration so that people will more likely convert and sign up for the product times you want to have that kind of thinking going in other ways again you're wasting a lot of time on the spinning your wheels and and building things that may or may not actually providing statistical significance  I I think those are great tips I know everyone's trying to become more data focused as their building and make better smarter decisions but as you said I think sometimes it's just %HESITATION not statistically significant my sister is shot my sister getting her PhD in statistics and sometimes she just makes are crazy so I'll I'll say about data is it doesn't tell us the why you know it tells us like some information tells why people aren't doing certain things or they are doing certain things and so that's where a customer support I am really engaging with your users is valuable because they will give you the full story on my second product that I built with busy bee I remember we would have people show up use the product leave and come back like every two weeks and I finally got frustrated because the data wasn't giving us any sort of indication so I just call them up and I was like why do you like user product for like a two week stretch and then not use it out and a lot of these people were just getting started in their business they were just setting up their studio so they would say %HESITATION you know %HESITATION I tax right now and then I got busy and I gave it to my business manager and they try it out and then they got busy until we realized the speaking here what's going on with all these %HESITATION business in that we're just starting out that we had to change the experience I'm not going to change the rate that we measured how they were using a product because of that  San Andreas said you have some tips for better automation  I am not sure I understand like when you're trying to automate good question injury appears on the line why don't you give us a little bit more detail on on your automation issues %HESITATION Austin free said did you have any books that you would recommend to someone who wants to become more first and user experience design  yeah I I think don't make me think is great %HESITATION I also read the design of everyday things %HESITATION I also love the laws of simplicity those are I think three I can go to box that anybody who's either interesting experience nine or you know working with designers or whatever %HESITATION because it just gives you a good holistic view of how you should think about the overall experience and then %HESITATION shot out to one of my instructors are doing she has it will green on user experience notebook that she puts out with a lot of great links and a lot of it's very relevant and timely and she does expiration of different %HESITATION lose your design experience topics so check her out at me dot com  San Andreas said if you're just starting out %HESITATION launching to maybe less than a hundred users what's the best way to get that customer feedback  it sounds like if there is a if it's if it's less than a hundred %HESITATION I actually just love getting them on the phone or and getting them to if at all possible like sit down and you were usability test with you because you learn so much by being as close to present as possible I'm rather than a surveying which you know Michael designed in a way that's financed or you don't know when they're filling it out or if they're telling you like the full information so it's gonna be a lot more candidates in a lot more valuable and if it's less than a hundred and you know distributed amongst your team and have each person take maybe a handful of the customers and collect the thing back but you want them to be using their own words as you get bigger you know as you get to the hundred plus then it's okay to collect on going back through surveys but you really want to make sure that you take some amount of time to establish more that personal connection is also going to be users that you can go back to you as you in array and say okay I mean we did what you said and we made these changes now tell us what you think ons you always want to have some of those people income constantly go back to and we'll provide you that valuable  yeah there's nothing like a phone call %HESITATION so hair said another what question from there how do you make sure the experiences same on all devices the apple watch desktop extenders you have any tips on making sure that it's consistent  that's that's a challenge and I would say that's actually something to then think about you know why do you want to distribute on all these different platforms on because it is it is very difficult especially if you are we using a code base persons building %HESITATION you know a native apps on each of these devices if you use the native app and you can get into all the nitty gritty details and design it specifically for that device and make sure it's a really rich experience but if you're you're doing something like phone gap or any other on  frameworks that you use the experience is going to be different and so it's up to you on to decide how you want that I would actually say  this is where you want to take the time to decide where are the majority of your users and focus on just one or two devices rather than trying to design for every single experience unless you have a really big company with a big budget you know lots of resources at your disposal on because it is going to be in that sort of thing where you want to have as close to an experience that's consistent as possible on but you still respect %HESITATION like particulars of the device right especially as it's like Starbucks where whichever Starbucks you go to in the world you're always going to get the same like experience the same products but they might be designed to like each copy house maybe design a little bit differently to %HESITATION relate to like a local flair and to the can you get there and so that's how you want to think about it don't assume that you're gonna be able to give the exact same experience on every single device  nice and conversely Olea said how do you feel about those landing pages that all look the same due to the similar sections with benefits testimonials X. setter I do you have an opinion on kind of that maybe two consisting of design across all products  no that's okay I think a lot of times we feel like %HESITATION with Klay Shane attacked me but it comes back to that point of familiarity and if people can move through your landing site understand what page for on on understands that it's similar to maybe some other like well designed sites on then they're gonna get information that they need and they're gonna want to use your product it's when you try to be two different %HESITATION or you know this is why I like a lot of times people hate going to flash lights because they're like oh wait now like ten seconds this thing to load up I could they just designed a simple HTML page right I'd like to try to get to a clever we try to write you a letter of experience that people start to drop box so you know there is nothing wrong in providing a level of consistency a level of familiarity that people have become accustomed jails onto don't don't just missed that and I would say it what's what you can do to make it a lot more personal is is the branding is is your voice as the way that you create the aesthetics around it so there's room to play in space  perfect and  so Eric asked how do you recommend finding the right balance between focusing on improving onboarding and communication or building new features to quote unquote delight users  yeah that's a great question and I know it's it's a challenge in any organization and I always like to push back to the business folks and ask them what's important you want to fix a leaky bucket or do you mean you want you know bring in new users and what I mean by that is if you have a leaky bucket right people are reading your product as no point in creating new features we really want to focus on onboarding keeping the people who are coming if instead you wanna tracking new users you know you don't care about the only about get then maybe building a new set of features that appeals to them it should be your focus on  I did you both it can be a challenge again unless you have a really big toll on by I would say it comes down to like one or that one of the metrics for the business what are they trying to do and often times on the way I've structured it in the past is there will be some iterations likes on sprint's where we just focus on the metric around you keeping user is getting getting changed anything and other iteration or another quarter and we decide okay we kind of got that down to you not as close to a science as we'd like but it's it's getting there now we can switch our attention which you were building out new features on but I think if we try to just building  aren't working with forgetting that looking back I felt you know throw back at them and say like what's important and when you do that it again grace that I already which they understand and it makes your life a lot easier to because you're not trying to do too much  St I'm Jeremih is asking  %HESITATION let's see what's your thoughts and opinions on using a motion %HESITATION sorry emoticons within an app or website to communicate candid information  three four emoticons or against about what a con I think you know I get a tear person can come back the persona on so if your customers feel like it and professional or they don't personally use it I wouldn't %HESITATION right if they are the type that you then it can be very engaging like certainly product time guys love them no jeans fit in there email subject lines and all over the site %HESITATION you know it's really Amazon does not you know Jeez I'm considered right customer base in someone because my face but just different kind of personality so it's up to you to play with your personality but also understand who it's going to attract and who it's going to put on and take the time to test that out  and so I think we have time for  I'm one more question because I know we're running a little bit over I'm so can all ask what are  your top five best design products that you use in your opinion and he gave three of his opinions and he is being very %HESITATION loving and said envision square an intercom our history favorites but he wants to know your five best design products you use  well I would definitely agree with you on square I don't webapp but certainly the %HESITATION the mobile app and the card reader are pretty well designed %HESITATION you know let's see I've got a minute sheet and put my iPhone I can look through the product  I'm here to tell you are actually quite frankly Instagram you know it's that simple to use and they even though they keep adding %HESITATION interest to it you don't really notice so it's I would say on the on the role of simplicity I'm for kind of a bigger product I actually would say %HESITATION  that  Indy is you know obviously pretty well designed I use it quite a lot as a traveler so I like it there things that are quirkier than others %HESITATION that I haven't liked but given what it's trying to do I think it's definitely pretty well designed I'm I also went slack no again really push button products simple to use on that %HESITATION for payments another payment product I like to use them because it's again pretty simple couple experience issues how do you feel about the fact that you have to write something in the band now  thank thank you have to give it a rest  %HESITATION I don't about that I I was in my concern was like when I had to transfer to the bank I %HESITATION was kind of like how do I do it it took a couple steps student there so that was that it was a little bit of a challenge but %HESITATION but I think somewhere to square it's it's good for our payments aren't certainly a lot more like simple to send you money Kansai like back I think one of my I work three or four are I have like one more that I have to  we'll talk about %HESITATION  I think  let me see  as  our  SO is found another messaging apps I would say is actually what's happened I think again really simple simple design  %HESITATION and I think that's it thank you I think you have your five you actually even given six honestly  yeah I just think it always comes down to like one of my using on a daily basis and %HESITATION you know what the big things are like messaging transacting that sort of stuff so yeah I think that covers one the like and then I I like I said I like the one and I like %HESITATION like to I think they're really well designed and use them a lot too  fantastic so pretty much thank you so much for chatting with us today and for really great talk and a big thank you also to those who attended today I hope you have a great rest of your day and keep designing awesome things
