resolution my name's Bobby Ghosh often I'm Jerry to run do we're sitting down with twenty five masters of the design industry were still in New York we're having a great time were speaking to amazing people and learning how to best designers in the world approach communication deployed design in their companies in this episode we're speaking cap walk ins cap is the VP of design at buzzfeed he's gonna tell us how to apply designed to anything how to build your organization and how to empower those around you this amazing episode is going to start right after this quick message  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  thanks for joining us things around all right so first question what's one thing about the sign that's clear to you that you don't feel as clear other people  I  anything that the easiest with simple Saint maybe I don't think were as important as we think we are I think like  design I I think that's a long time ago when I first art and design I think  a lot of designers are having to a lot of work inside the companies to make design like heard and have like a seat at the table and %HESITATION to be discipline it wasn't just about like making something look a certain way on but to be part of defining how something worked I think that was when I started his ten years ago I remember listening to all these podcasts from different like designed leaders of the time about like the struggle of that like how do you get people to buy into design %HESITATION and I I don't think we ever lost that chip that idea like we need this like we need to be special we need to like it means being more than what we are %HESITATION then eight feel like and in most cases we kind of accomplished but we cannot set out to accomplish right and  I feel like %HESITATION now where to place her actually to come back towards the other disciplines like tool I bring people with us like bring engineering the spring product with a spring like these other like business with us %HESITATION into those conversations were almost like we started to push them away you know like push them off the table a little bit and I like I don't know that I feel great about that  we've done a  so how then would you frame what a designer supposed to be doing now  if it's if it's not all the stuff that we've been you know that we've been talking about for the last decade %HESITATION no I I think it's the same I think I don't think that it's about doing something differently in terms of our job description I think like the job is still to help define how things worked %HESITATION define how they look into it merry that all together into an experience that makes sense is delightful and impact and for the business insurance %HESITATION  I think  our job actually maybe I think we should add to our job is again like making sure they were giving a voice to everyone else and not a voice through our lands right think like I mean we're gonna probably talk about the term design thinking at some point this conversation which is a remake noted that that I am %HESITATION and I think is like a is exclusive is like like prohibitive to other teens and other people %HESITATION %HESITATION and I think it's like how do you like the job you have is to make the areas between design and other disciplines greater like how do we start to like merge them back together %HESITATION because that's when like the best the best products have ever worked on or when that's been that that's been the truth the everything is just messy and everyone's doing kind of a little bit of everything and understand each other because of that we worked a long time again to get killed empathize with design but like now it's time to come  we have a lot we have we wield a lot of power now in this industry and it's time to maybe like reach back out  other teams the so give us an example right %HESITATION you mention something interesting that the job of design when applied correctly is to make everything grayer and things are messy and when things are messy better work gets done because of it %HESITATION  I wanted to climb down from the abstract and come into the real world give us an example  well for a small start up actually that is a that's usually just how it is and I think a lot of people like a four five person start up like that was my living in my career was all like very small start ups  I would sit next to an engineer who is building the thing I was designing at almost the same time is signing it like you know you like or we have this much money in this much time so %HESITATION we should probably run  and so like a lot of what we were doing like I learned to code right because like it would help him to not have to do certain parts of the code rights we can work on the bigger problems and he learned to like quickly make design decisions in this in a similar framework to me and so we were constantly passing back and forth you're sitting right beside each other like showing each other we're working on and like getting feedback in real time %HESITATION  and that was like a really strong collaboration obviously %HESITATION and then I can a large examples I worked at the before buzzfeed  and that's the way I don't I mean it's been a couple of years I don't really know how works anymore but when I started  everybody in the entire company on the first day deployed the website to production code code like even the even the person at the front desk like would add themselves to the team page someone walking through it like would sit with you like walking through that process and like show you how it works and they gave you this wasn't about design right to give you an appreciation for even if you never gonna do that again like what it takes to push it out I mean at the system where we were deploying dozens of times a day %HESITATION and it was cheaper to do an easy to do down and that but that was also was really interesting about that is the reason it was so easy because like that was one of the metrics that engineering is with like hand a designer deploy this can anybody to play this because they knew that we would want to and we need to %HESITATION it's I wanted like deploying code and see all the time and it was pretty awesome and really empowering and that like I can I kind of gray area makes you appreciate what other people go through or like what  the strength of the disciplines are and how to like utilize them %HESITATION to make the best stuff I think %HESITATION  so I mean that that's human isn't like a design example but you can imagine going both ways for like okay cool that's grades will bring engineers into design reviews you you know want their opinion on the design they care a lot about the designs they are building it and deploying it and measuring it %HESITATION and so like that collaboration gets really tight because you're working in the same space on the same types of problems and is it and when you use the word Massey is a because the roles aren't so defined that if the structure is rigid and that is more fluid as the problem of all's well everything is like there's a there's a difference between like %HESITATION specialty ends in like an execution of that specialty %HESITATION I think like everyone respect each other's domain expertise right like I respect the domain expertise of our data analyst for hate to know way more than I do about how to look at that day they look at all the time %HESITATION  I may ask them all like questions and like challenge assumptions that they're making right but %HESITATION but at the end of the day like they are the two minutes from my trust them %HESITATION or engineer right his building something in there telling me like %HESITATION this is really hard we may have a very long conversation about why it's hard and they're they're easier ways we can do this and I'm gonna disagree %HESITATION  but at the end of the day like their domain expertise is what is why were having a conversation the first place and so  the product designers at sea and it was here to talk about later like are defined I think like people know what their job is %HESITATION but actually I and I can't speak for the disciplines but at C. like and now here like the job descriptions for product designers include product engineering elements to like kind of force that issue %HESITATION %HESITATION so designers do write code at sea on they touch code and like they do think about products off it's like a thing we measure like your talent like your you know your professional growth by like do you think about product things in a product you anything about data to think about how things are built %HESITATION it's a kind of big fat into the world's Christian so how does this gray area kind of organization thing play into the hot topic of design thinking  the the term I hate the most %HESITATION wool with plans I'm thinking is I think we made it up as a way to  we give it a brand branded it yeah this is a sign of print things so we rented it  I thought about that %HESITATION that's totally true see brand of this thing and we took ownership of something that everyone does and just like and we're like oh you're doing design thinking in there like nine wait I always do this on an engineer I just I've always it's a creative pursuit of well I work %HESITATION like I go through an exploratory phase I go through definition phase I go through like a you know a %HESITATION because report quest which is kind of shaping like refining the thing and I measure the result like I I go through and as I go through design phase %HESITATION but %HESITATION we do that organization like every to every bone in every department like in every company ever has that has design thinking and it just they never branded as just how people work %HESITATION and sometimes  I think the lens of a designer on other disciplines is useful I think like there's something about %HESITATION and I I don't miss in design thinking when I kind of miss it just like the disciplinary way and like thing from a user's perspective is really %HESITATION  that is really useful for people man out for other people in other departments are like to help highlight a problem are highly why something's important %HESITATION and I think instilling that is really useful I don't know that we call the design thinking necessarily it's more like thinking about the end user at all in the matter that's an employee that works here if you're an HR or if it's like the you know the other engineers have to look at your pull request or if it's about your team or if it's about that person using your product right I think like %HESITATION and again a lot of changes a lot of HR departments at all the concerned with is the end user writing about all the time and they just don't have what they've never like branded or described in that way %HESITATION  so the the work environment it sounds like we're describing is a company where design thinking we take out the word design were just thinking that way there is a process about how you discover problems identify solutions execute and measure right %HESITATION designers are now moving into a messy environment where they are learning the skills of their counterparts and hopefully getting the same the other way around right %HESITATION and that sounds really interesting to me what I'm curious about now is you know there there's many people who say that the sign can be applied to anything right %HESITATION but very few who talk about what that actually looks like within a company then %HESITATION so I'm really curious to hear how you think about that seemingly very abstract concept especially within a company like let's see a plan designed to other disciplines like problems yeah you spoke about HR for example right like caring about the and use the computers but other examples sure %HESITATION  Sunday I'm going to get into this later now but %HESITATION but I also like I work across a lot of different I'm not I'm not just working in design here %HESITATION %HESITATION ordering IT teams are like I manage a team which is one team that I work with and then I also do a lot of kind of HR type things for the tech organization at large here about speed %HESITATION so most recently like we just had our annual review process company wide %HESITATION but like I was tasked with picking out for tech the tech department like what that process should even look like like one of the questions we should ask %HESITATION what are the you know what's the rubric we should use Stephen like make give peer feedback liking it should just be an open form should there be some rubric that can help people manage that %HESITATION let me do that for a while I did like the mid year reviews last year hopefully anyways before that %HESITATION seven kind in this for a while and %HESITATION  any signs I think it's like kind of like that assessing only doing this over and over and and thinking about it each time like what went well it didn't go well like how do people respond to this to the type of feedback they got like by check by the ball that over time %HESITATION actually just recently I got like an engineer sent sent me like twenty points of feedback from his team about how this in your view went %HESITATION which was awesome right and terrifying  the twenty things like this is great but I'm I'm nervous that I did a lot like many of this is that if you read the twentieth thing first just to make sure it's like maybe put the worst at the end right %HESITATION but %HESITATION but yeah I mean I think it's like and when and I'm doing I'm doing it from the design perspective of like okay like the end users on the people that have to do this in the people receiving the feedback and how do we create a situation where we have the highest likelihood of people getting great feedback right and people that people will accept and listen to %HESITATION ands %HESITATION  again this is landing at the real thing is I can actually my product development thinking at all like it's like how do we try something see how it works for the people that impacts and then like iterate on it again %HESITATION but yeah I think it's like how many departments working just happens to be like how I played it for the sort of things did you guys land on a specific part of a specific process in the in the review %HESITATION in the media and the annual review that  it was an obvious up front and that now maybe other people can use as well yeah that happens pretty frequently on  so the first one I did was pretty basic it was just like here's a form you can fill out that says like what went well in the last six months and like what could be improved  in the last six months assuming people would use like their career ladder for their particular departments like the rubric yeah that was the very first one yeah got it turned out not to happen  I turned out to be like there's also pretty varied like if you had someone who wrote great feedback they were great feedback is just someone who did that they would do it %HESITATION and a lot of the reviews for like %HESITATION cannot kind of shallower like did have enough detail or like one specific in  this was thinking about that problem and the other thing about the other nice thing about working here particulars I can I can  designers are my Guinea pigs can do whatever I want to them and then as we try things sometimes %HESITATION and so we are I'm all in Terry I hope I mostly Biggs normally that's all they  well it's like they they know the like the the point for them to give me a few talk about it right because then like that's the like %HESITATION it's an easy way to trusting on impacting two hundred people or thousand people %HESITATION and so we we rode up product design leadership principles like we like this something I'd seen on Amazon I actually felt was really useful in terms of a rubric for like movies you can see it online there's a leadership principles list that they have use company wide in like this we use for reviews at Amazon take a couple for each person your peer reviewing it for yourself from like %HESITATION  so we tried it we wrote our own principles elected much different companies and like kind of put together we thought represented us on the design team for lead like leadership not design skill and we use that it seemed to like actually result in really strong feedback like because it gave people something they like latch on to to say like okay this is the thing I'm gonna write examples of why this is the thing I'm trying not to conjure up a category like this is like categorical %HESITATION we tried that it works really well there's like %HESITATION we should apply this to the tech team like like the seems folks what started happening was the engineering or found out about it about this document and I got pain by the VP of engineering is like he can I can I just like copy this and finding replace design with engineering right now like what you're gonna do that  like make these tech wide right I'm so we're to the leadership team like we adjusted some of the principles to make more sense and like added a couple that like I hadn't thought of right we can enter it on this document  and we used it for the new year's and we used it again for the annual summer probably I mean it's still like it's a living document we need to work on it even more than than it was before but I would say overall the type of feedback we've gotten is better than it's ever been %HESITATION has been really interesting to see that like like my started here I use design a lot to like try out ideas and then if they worked so like spread them if they were spreadable  our people were  and that's been working really well  we are you you wrote a forget the name of the article that you actually wrote a an article about %HESITATION the power structure or the or the organizational structure we started the CO orders go down yeah you flip the permit around and and you create a not a power structure but a support structure right %HESITATION number granted people then go out and read about it but I wanted to talk about it a little bit can you give us the gist of what you were trying to get %HESITATION what what you were trying to relate with flipping the the power pyramid sure I guess I think the the typical way managers think about the title as it had in the past which is  the opposite of everything I've ever tried to do  I have thought about their job as %HESITATION as there's power in that job right there's like I and I think it's not crazy it's like I I you still kind of perceived like I look I see on like wow that that person wields power right as like power to change things to like say things and things happen like that does it never really goes away like that's it's not untrue that that's that that's what happens %HESITATION but  %HESITATION  I think it's really useful for managers specifically like leadership in general to think about it upside down like to think about themselves as  like there are times were like I have something I want to happen and I want to like work with people to make it happen and that's what we do %HESITATION but my pride that's on my primary mode like with a primary job is actually to create a scenario where like  supporting the people that are actually ask that the top doing the work like actually executing on everything because especially as you grow and scale like that band gets whiter than this than the packed in the leadership structure you know I mean like like the  the amount of knowledge is so much bigger yeah in that'll not layer right in that likes level of work %HESITATION like there is there a lot of times I find myself like saying to a designer like they're showing me some some work in the couple of like directions and we're talking about I'm like look you know this better than I do like I don't actually like I can give you an opinion and like a semi informed opinion but really like this isn't a brand question this isn't like you know I can you know this better than I do so you should just make a call like what do you think is best %HESITATION I'm going to give us the plans are for people like prepared for that when you check because that's not normal right so when you know it's not it's yeah I mean I think they're asking you because they're like I'm used to you making this call  yeah do they get terrified around  we we just tell them to make the call you to figure it out now I sometimes I was startled sometimes is there like a there's a moment where they they are like they had they know what they think but they haven't said what they think %HESITATION and they're kind of like %HESITATION %HESITATION and then they'll tell you what they actually think we still I mean we still even today kind of battle that a little bit it's not because  of the power structure I don't think it's the it's just getting designers feel confident up to make a call for themselves or even even if there wasn't a calling him just like here's my opinion %HESITATION is just something with %HESITATION  like any credit for setting like people building confidence in their own opinions something we're always going to work on about a lot of time we do find ourselves like from a prism just stop attacks happen this week my first question is and about their lands like well what do you think person who did this like white like why do you think that option three is the best  tell us why let's talk about it %HESITATION can help just like focus the conversation on to what they actually want to know is your is your ideal work environment than that people around you that works report to you but still work with you obviously that they just make decisions is that like the ideal set up I think so I I read this book called %HESITATION turn the ship around just I don't remember the name of the person around it but the idea at the core idea that will explain how things and I  in the military like in the navy you the orders come down from the top right like you think of when I turn left like the captain tells you turn this person %HESITATION last initials this prison term but like really the person here who's steering knows we should turn off the whole time there's waiting right not insane like I can see the iceberg right slot is like yeah yeah right exactly seems bird but let's just like hang on I got away to my gonna get that which I guess will run into it %HESITATION but if you're talking bout speed anyone move quickly and like especially digital stuff like you think we can change just at that on all the times we can experiment with things can run experiment %HESITATION see what the results are and make changes based on not on so I think we're in a position to not worry as much about it %HESITATION it  but what I want ideally is  just to be informed ice one at like I don't like the thing we try to avoid a surprise %HESITATION for like big things like obviously if it's like a small tweak or something I don't really care I don't know %HESITATION but if for making it some decision that same semi critical like as long as people are aware like that's that's like two one the court things in the nineteen tries to do is like create awareness all the time with everyone like not just me and not just the design team with every single person on a product on the team %HESITATION because then it's like it's up to me than to say like Hey hold on yeah right like if I don't say anything we're good to go like you don't you don't hear from me that's a good thing like that's like means like we're we're cool yeah %HESITATION  and if I didn't see it and it goes out that's my fault because you create awareness and I just decided not eye sight until occur I didn't have time and that's not on you as a designer right I need you to move quickly and in the teens to move fast  so I'm thinking through the lens of a designer now who is that a company is listening to this and sees that iceberg within their product right %HESITATION and they want to act they want to turn left right how do they go about that without coming off as %HESITATION what's what's the term like going against in the going against the growing insubordinate or allow I'll reckless or like just doing their own thing right well really I mean I think you really need the organization around it to understand that in now %HESITATION I think there are I mean obviously the way you approach something is always very important if you just make make the call on your leg when you know I made the call didn't tell anyone right like that's a problem %HESITATION  again like how do you broadcast an idea and it is and I gave choice without making it seem totally fine all but inevitable at the same time right like if nothing happens is what we're gonna do like and no one says anything this is the next step right like I'm letting you all know this is what we want to do  and we're planning on doing this in a week they're gonna ship us like this is going to go out like that's the plan and  it's up to anybody to kind of weigh it like you you don't whenever close all I think people think making decisions closing the conversation like that's the feeling that people want to go over I made a call over but it's never over  like you know like there's been times like the day before like someone's going like cable line did you think about this important things that no one thought about in like with stop and like reconsider there's no end on  thinking about time and your work is a fluid  like a flu expect from like a fluid spectrum is like the only is probably the way to communicate with you know about it %HESITATION without pissing people off too much so in that sense the designer is recognizing the suppose an iceberg has to present the outcomes  jewel outcomes right and maybe someone raises their hand and says that's not in fact an iceberg that's an opportunity or these are two things to consider before you actually there laughter may we should actually there right right and it's also to the that not just the design of a thirteen to to like figure out who are the people who  with no the most yeah right who are like if there is somebody there also times where you broadcast something but you also should have all like directly asked like don somebody for their opinion you know like where is like well this person actually is is a domain expertise thing we're doing like we shouldn't insurer like and it's not just a broadcast we hope they catch like we want them to give  back when we need that from this person because otherwise they would broadcast as we ship and then this person with some expertise comes and tells us that we were like we're totally wrong and here's why in we've just cost the business whatever how much money in like you know it's the whole mess so kind of identifying those people are making sure that you engage them proactively also save you a lot of pain so it's not it's not looking at this process as red tape it's inform decisiveness you want to make sure that you can make decisions make sure your informed when you make them don't be a rebel that's the gist of it right people that look at stake holders as the fighters but not there not it collects all collaboration it's like who are my collaborators like who knows the most right Michael my gonna get the opinion from as a manager do you feel the sense of responsibility that your people's happiness is your problem or is it their problem shifts both of our problems  %HESITATION I think there's only so much that I can do to make someone like happy with the job that they're doing or the team that they're on like there's a little bit of it there's responsibility all over the place right this responsibility to the people that work with those responsibly to the person who's on the team to  frame things for themselves in a way that is healthy %HESITATION and constructive think like the %HESITATION like I am here to help maybe re frame things or to point them in a direction or to give them advice on how to think about a problem that they're having there isn't a personal or the product of process or whatever %HESITATION but like  it's  it should be rare that I am like reaching in to like touch like a team to like like like %HESITATION this isn't working I'm gonna reach in and do something myself like mean something horribly wrong like that like this is not working %HESITATION  and I think there I mean I can relax my in my career to times were like I wish someone would have done something to really I should  I should have like just owned the way I was feeling and I tried to pay and like figured it out %HESITATION like tried to work it out without feeling is also a problem %HESITATION so I do I I do feel responsible to certain degree like I feel like I need to create an environment where people feel like they can be transparent how their feelings we can help them right %HESITATION but the end of the day like I am like I can't force someone to think a certain way or feel certainly I can only try to create the situation that will I'd like they will be a successful and and that's that's kind of it  so creating an environment where the team feels like they can be transparent %HESITATION sometimes that coincides with %HESITATION feeling vulnerable so how can leaders %HESITATION help make their teens feel protected yeah  thank attacked it might be the wrong way to look at it like it's it's mostly about just like  %HESITATION being able to be vulnerable like the real part of it in the son of man protected from the out come of the normal right because like that's that's also like just not healthy like you need to like this any impact sometimes from decision maker coming out  %HESITATION  something I I do a lot as I try to talk to my team %HESITATION like the main one ones or whatever about the problems I'm having %HESITATION not only on the non I'm asking for help but like to kind of like admit that like I also have difficulty like there are %HESITATION or I'm wrong like I try to tell people when I'm wrong like I think that that's something that is really important %HESITATION like when I first got to buzzfeed we I want to make a lot of changes right like I this team I I didn't set up with processes I didn't think to do within like there are certain parts of things I wanted to start experimenting with and changing and that's hard and scary right for people on a destructive and painful they're like so many things especially with the bad change like here is just so many times right that you get into a situation where someone changes something for the worse and and they just like hold on to it and like your stock as a designer in the slight with this change that really sucks and you can do about it because the person in charge won't recognize it %HESITATION and so with each of the changes I made I was very careful with the whole team like look we're just gonna try this and it totally blows up in our face and it doesn't work I need you to tell me because we will stop like I don't need I have no ego about the process we have or like the tools were using like I just want to have like something healthy that you all feel productive and we're gonna try some stuff and we change a lot of things based on the feedback like they are very open %HESITATION I think we've created situational very open about the things that are working in things that aren't working %HESITATION we we even like so if we're actually about to do our second one of these we have a we did a design off site last year %HESITATION with a few the designers and they're in the management design management team %HESITATION to talk about like some pretty hard stuff to talk about what we believe today what are we doing today that we do because we just have always done it and maybe some of you shouldn't do and it was changed on and like we found out that the roles talk that I wrote when I first got here that that actually like ripped off from the one I wrote it at sea was like wasn't working  likely like the designers are super confused and like we have you know I like it when you look at it there like on understand once just be doing my doing a good job or not  and like I think the fact they can say that and they all knew I wrote it right it wasn't all I have no confusion like that I'd done that %HESITATION but for them to be able to say that to me at entrust I mean we when we wrote the whole thing I mean we spent the next like twelve weeks re writing the whole thing rolling out a draft to the design team asking them for their feedback making sure it was clear and probably an adjusted again right and like me trying to create that situation by admitting the possibility of being wrong and the and the desire to not like like I'm coming right I just want it to be the best it can be a right and so I think that makes that actually creates vulnerability for me which actually lets down  I think like the more vulnerable to us yeah on because they know there's no conflict as a consequence for being vulnerable and they also feel like an author is part of the process right right speaking of authors I mean you you write a lot  like that's like what exactly is like a  %HESITATION she studied creative writing is that right now  how do you use that day today outside of writing on your blog which is I read all the time a lot of %HESITATION and then I'm very curious if you if you teacher team principals that they can bring in to work every day %HESITATION through expressing themselves forget writing I mean anyway expressing themselves share  some managers say right all the time as my basically job now  as of I I like every every day start with Mike running up I'm running Google docs ally the like it's like every like all these lines of sketching like I'm like I just need to Google docs like it will actually be very upset like old Lang %HESITATION  %HESITATION some like my my job is communication right like this like the the if you boil the whole thing down like it's not designed myself not design my jobs not like anything's I'm doing it's just like the core of it is just like fi is communication communicating to people and helping them do the same %HESITATION so do it all the time I write a lot  internally  as for the nineteen concern so  yes I think that's a lease base camp here to document the design process the designers like spike document their whole project in base camp requires a lot of writing %HESITATION and  what that's like that's something we're working on I I don't know that I I mean I can't claim to have like instilled any principles of communication and then through not I think we work with them along on it %HESITATION because hard like it's hard to %HESITATION  it's hard but important bill explain complicated concepts succinctly and %HESITATION something I noticed recently that we do a lot on as designers is like we're working something hard research explained somebody whether it's in writing or like in person we try to explain everything major aggregate credit comprehensive about how complicated this is because we feel like well we understand it took me a long time so I need to like tidal wave you all's information %HESITATION and I think like  as a writer that's nothing you never do you can never tell you never do that let you try to like cut it down to like what is the essence what you actually need to know what is this person have to know to understand him saying  or even what things now and nothing like they can ask a question about it then I can answer like giving people more of like a %HESITATION spending less time explaining in more time and like answering %HESITATION in line for questions I think it's something that like we've been thinking about a lot lately in terms of how we communicate our work on to each other into other departments on  as in like we kind of overlook people information still  it's not just designed to like that's something I was into making a hi how are you doing that with a team is like writing something encourage them to do yeah so %HESITATION actually started this tech blog which is pretty cool and sweet and kind of challenging seniors liners to write for the blog we had it is like internal or external its external let's things just tech dot buzzfeed dot com maybe %HESITATION that's probably wrong but  %HESITATION but anyway I think it's like a yes they like me we did have a design blog for awhile we had a few designers writing for it on medium which is medium and like we write about the CSS framework being rolled out its like the designer who worked on it would write the post in and we do I like I would help to pass on it and give them some feedback and market up in Google docs  %HESITATION and and we rolled out its like that was helpful it's not the same now like it's like writing like a post about something is there some similar issue not explaining your work instinct way but like it's a little bit different now trying to like the little P. R. at the same time %HESITATION the base camp thing we've like we're still working out how to help people with that whether that's like just forcing a framework that simple like that's something that's like a constraints are good you know like treating those constraints to like really just like this is it this is all you should be writing and like over time kind of loose and not as people get comfortable Latin becomes a habit %HESITATION but I think this is something always working again sitting there and hire more people we're gonna have to you know it's like everybody's different skill sets and work on it all the time so  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work  here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  of course we're inspired by our design program which is over sixty years old  today IBM employs more than one thousand three hundred professional designers and we've certified more than sixty thousand IBM verse in the practices of IBM design thinking  the result  divers teams working more closely than ever with our clients their users and our partners to create modern solutions  %HESITATION provide differentiated human centered outcomes to the world we'd love to share the story more closely with you  and I hope to see you soon at one of our IBM studios worldwide  I would also like to thank our friends envision for their support invision is the world's leading product design platform power in the future of digital design to their understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One Netflix and Airbnb I work with remote teams all the time and I found the keeping a healthy dialogue is really important without it building strong work relationships gets a lot harder and that leads the poor collaboration  I've also found the prototypes are great way for me to show my full vision for design and this helps cut down a lot of back and forth  vision makes all of this really easy you can rapidly prototype %HESITATION designs and collaborate across every stage of your project taking your ideas from concept to coat it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone and project managers to designers developers and writers  teams that build digital products artist series vantage when the using vision suite of prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision I thought com slash high resolution for three months free  so earlier you spoke about the fact that you also run the I. T. team here grain and you've been here two years two years and how far into the two years that you  I work with IT about a year seven manager them since January I think or December of like the last like twelve thirteen months ago any so the thing that we're most cares about is how do you split your time because as of beef you design that the last thing I thought about was like I. T. right %HESITATION but it's actually pretty awesome like you spoke about what that relationship looks like so got like what what is it they look like or week look like a cap  it depends a lot of Google docs yeah %HESITATION yeah it's it's kind of insane with I would say right now there's multiple problems right now %HESITATION where I'm actually one of my senators is doing a six week like residency off the team on a on an editorial she's making editorial work doing editorial work for six weeks some managing her designers temporarily for liking other couples just gets back please come backs %HESITATION  but %HESITATION  yeah so now right now it's completely insane but in general I mean the nice thing is like both on design and I see like the management the managers on that those teams are pretty strong and so like %HESITATION and lean on them a lot to kind of bone the teens %HESITATION which is a manager when I was not when I was just %HESITATION design manager was like what I actually really wanted to happen I wanted to own the team right and what it's like with me in the design managers like have kind of like the bill to the division forth into the goals and so I think like %HESITATION  I'm a lot more like a connector and I like a guiding voice for them and like I say ten the manager meeting so we have a design and %HESITATION meeting each week and I team manager meaning each week %HESITATION  we have team why meanings right that I go to solve IT and then like all of design meetings like I go to those and talk to them I have a lot of one on ones  a lot of white ones right now  with all the managers but also some of the designers on that I try to keep in touch with %HESITATION I obviously I can part of like the tech leadership team so I have those meetings we talk about the whole tech team Hans working %HESITATION that's kind of how my week looks I wouldn't that wouldn't leader seeing you that they said let's give the design guide this IT stuff  Olympic three that's exactly how that meeting went this is put the design guide charge of IT that's it well it wasn't that far off I am  %HESITATION  what happened was we had done a us we do employee engagement service I don't know if like you know a lot approximately this but what happens is you send a survey out the whole company kind of gauging how people are feeling about the company's strategy like the communication within a company like another job thirteen dare managements like how things are going right %HESITATION and we break that down by department we can kind of get an overview of how like design feels with intact %HESITATION how tec feels overall and kind of see what the trends are  and so about a year ago we noticed that the  the I. T. team was in a knot was a non like an anomaly was like off like it was very low like the way they were feeling about how things are going on their team %HESITATION was not great they were feeling very good %HESITATION and they're kind of missing that like their director kind of moved on from buzzfeed in like they were kind of they were missing that person and %HESITATION and so  there was I don't remember exactly how it went down but like someone mentioned in leadership meeting that like because I I think it was very clear about that point that I really care about organizational things and care about people and %HESITATION and I had some success with the design team and kind of like bring like again that was a team that felt pretty broken and like and I a year and was feeling a lot like more stable and strong and healthy  think there's some trust there that that was something I was good at %HESITATION cared about  and I remember getting a direct message from my boss who runs Dow she runs all of technologies like that oversees all of the department has eleven o'clock at night and she like message me on slack I was even on I wasn't even online like on my phone and like it she said like Hey like  research here about managing IT team was like I didn't never said that  well if someone else said that I should do that that's called inception yeah she's planted that in your in your right  did I say it even now I'm questioning myself like that I do not %HESITATION and so she and I talked about a lot is I want to talk about it I can only hear the design team right it was still like I had a lot of work to do still %HESITATION I look like I really care about I mean I knew that the only I teach him how huge or great in an attack as I knew them Anderson a personally I really I like them a lot of care about them as people I wanted them to feel good as it will look like if I can help lay as long as it's temporary I'm totally happy to like work on this for like in Iraq can be hiring somebody right to do this job so like no problem around a few months and now it's been over a year and that's what I want done I %HESITATION yeah and so %HESITATION sixty really cool I really it's on  I I I I like design stuff I also really like now it's obvious I really management things and I was really curious to see like is managing and different discipline what were the differences in what similarities and  that's been really interesting to find out like what the what the heck how common it is and then also like the ways that it kind of isn't what what were those things the the differences and similarities %HESITATION well coming out is a kind of like  every team is the same stuff like at the at the baseline like there's %HESITATION you know there's like nails hierarchy of needs your isn't the by bases like food shelter every teeny through in shelter there's no there's no other if if you don't do that nothing else on the part and it doesn't get lunch right like we need let me lunch and we should have some yeah we should do something about this hunger problem department %HESITATION and so  and those things are all the same they're like  communication transparency like the you know %HESITATION managers who are thinking about the team's happiness right like all these like  all these like you know not knowing if you're doing the job or not that's like the such a weird thing to like everyone needs to know everyone needs to have some sense like I'm doing my job and doing it well you know like they need to be able to like not have to get verified from Sony doing a job she is now on so there are things like you know  roll documentation that didn't exist so like we should do that's what people can read and now these are things opposed to do great at them like skills good %HESITATION %HESITATION  regular one ones with their manager work happening right so like when our doing now the managers are weekly wants with all the people that were fortunately teen goals like kind of like team has your teen collaborate with each other %HESITATION these are all things like this nineteen needed I teachings engineering needs a turn everyone needs this these things to be good in order to do anything to execute it even the most like basic level right to get just to a foundational level of execution %HESITATION what's interesting is the difference is  but there are departmental differences I find very interesting in there somewhere but they're also not we're like %HESITATION design sometimes like gets like to actually a service sometimes right in saying that we hear a lot %HESITATION but in like part of development particular particular here or somewhere like until it doesn't feel that way like it's like it's very integrated it feels like one team %HESITATION it doesn't like a service but decision I. T. is a kind of always is like it's a piece of infrastructure I guess the core piece of light company infrastructure in so that I know that feeling of being a service never really goes away but all the pain of being a service remains do you know what I mean I like those challenges like with the design team you're like oh let's get rid of those let's let's try to get out of that right nineteen you can never you can never do that right you have to like like you have to respond when it's like someone's computer dies and their work was on it and it was a really important story were trying to get out right %HESITATION like  yeah it's like that's like the it never really those challenges stay the same and it's been a really interesting thing to try to manage and understand how to make it the best it can be and make them feel really great about it %HESITATION at the same time is like not not try to isolate white away from that idea you know on and it's been like that then last this really occurred in the last like three or four months even %HESITATION seconds of the first night of time trying to like get a martini centric things that I know how to do already I'm are you see given the breadth of management experience you had at buzzfeed and the amount of work you've done with different kinds of people you're sitting across from two people at this table right now us to assume one of us is a direct report and the other one of us is a manager what would you want what what would you want to tell the manager about the direct report that they should know to do a better job and and their manager role %HESITATION and what would you tell the direct report about the manager to make them do a better job at being a direct report  I think the manager stuff is all in a rehash of what we've said so far about like  being open about your own like channels %HESITATION that you might be wrong or like you know kind of like %HESITATION building empathy by being vulnerable yourself reading is like really important and then like listening to the  helping them I think there's a thing or like managers listen a lot but they don't do anything like that feel like %HESITATION I listened and like that's when you're for it like a therapist and singing well now you know like division courage people saw them because of their also times you need to like actually help somebody and like that's important so try to identify with those are ask if they want your help %HESITATION like I and everyone along with like two new thing for me right now is there anything I can do to help you %HESITATION  inside you'll see now and sometimes people think about it for awhile and then they'll say like holy and might be nice to whatever %HESITATION all asked like if I did this would that be helpful right on to doctor port like I think that %HESITATION  director person to take more responsibility for making their manager get this is like a really this Mike this Michael **** up actually but like but I think  a lot of people and this is not the fault of people that are of the the direct reports I think %HESITATION not necessarily but a lot of I mean my eyes half of my career I didn't know a good management was and I was getting managed and I'm getting is pretty poorly if I think about it like if I go back and think okay %HESITATION how my doing this and how what I want to stop and like I wasn't happening for me on this because I had no clue like I had never had a good manners I never understood what that I never really pursued that knowledge of what it should be second I remember when I had my first one on one at at sea with Iran and I was like wait what  every week  and I can talk about my problems and you might do something like it was the weirdest feeling it was just like I was like all my god I was like this I spent six years I think do not having any of this like this feeling so ticked all the time and not be able to like talk to anybody about it %HESITATION it was insane I just in the  and what's really the findings the information is out there like I think mention books are not just for managers I was started reading management books before I became a manager I was still like a direct report %HESITATION  because I just wanted to now like I had gone to a place in my career as a sex so frustrated management laziness no like why it was so bad %HESITATION so it's hard to read these books and like  like I think I would encourage anybody to read something like managing humans %HESITATION Michael lop like that's like it's a very easy read it's it tells you  everything a good manager like a again a kind of a baseline in some given the honor of like what a good manager should even do and then you should set your expectations %HESITATION like they're still times of my manager did I ask for things that I know I need like I need this thing I need this from you like I need this direction from you I need you to tell me  this thing %HESITATION because it's like I think it's unreasonable to expect every managers and expects a lot of them are first time managers I have like every manager my team as a for is their first time like new than doing for year two but like that's not that long you know hung to take a good design you know like a decade now and so it's the people see managers like I should just be really great at this and it's not it's just as hard to get good at that and so I think having expectations wrecked report it's also a responsibility not let about manager be a bad manager you know to keep pushing on that or to like raise it to their manager right like to keep kind of like trying to get what you need out of them and to realize what that is it's like I don't know that's the big thing I don't think people taking of us for the things you need  so there's something a buzzfeed called the manager Dan yes so I'm really curious what that is %HESITATION and what are the outcomes that you're trying to produce for your manager's especially considering that you may  a good bit of them the first time yeah %HESITATION to full disclosure I stole this from that's a two  this is it  are still %HESITATION and and actually I just got I went down to I went to see if he wants to go to talk to their learning and development team about manager because they've been there for a lot longer than I than we've done it here and I only still like my with my memory of it and like to talk about how they've evolved over time like what their successes been like what the challenges are like and how to structure was really and they were like here's all the stuff like they just like gave it to us awesome %HESITATION so it when he was stealing  they really she's in the the person I talked to she email me later would like all of these like videos that they use for like onboarding people in the dens and like it was cool is super neat on time I have a text book that she recommended on my desk that I'm I'm reading a text book  facilitation right now %HESITATION is really cool so I mentored ends are for us our bi weekly there like every two weeks and they are a mix of managers right now across the tech team %HESITATION that meet together to in like a space that we consider like a account like a cone of silence kind of really people can say what they say anything like the man just talk about hard hard manager things like you you have a design review redesign critique and people can get formal that critique ideally you can give each other feedback you can like turn on a hard the project is an unsigned critique nine managers on how that like many somehow that outlet that they have their manager and that's kind of it and the thing I notice is like if you a lot of bad managers also have bad managers like like that's not uncommon and so asking and hoping that changes it is an income isn't enough either right you're kind of like they're limited in their ability to get you back to a good feedback from people who are successor doing things differently and so  %HESITATION and so we've murder like me you know we have engineering managers product manager people manage product manager managers %HESITATION  design managers I team managers like all we've mixed them into these like four five person groups labeled bands and they like need every couple of weeks they talk about as long structure right now they talk about whatever's like right now I see that the topic is around %HESITATION anywhere views and like how to think about compensation adjustments right and they're having like hard conversation sometimes means about like why this person and like this is what's happening and I don't know what to do in like but they have peeling advice from there like a group of people may have experienced before %HESITATION are similar experience or think about something maybe in a different way and that's been really valuable %HESITATION  we talked about so re re re tooling them right now to be better and we're gonna include another department ran start including some editorial managers very soon and and that the person I work with us on Amy and I were like well we should pause the downs for like three or four weeks we can like really focused on retooling this thing we we suggest it to the people down there like now like we are not stop and they were like don't pause this like they were like really like Texas yeah they're really like wait don't do this don't with his super valuable right now and like so we just the right okay keep hi thanks for  %HESITATION but yes that's been really awesome on to a manager please talk to each other and to learn from each other on I'm really said of the editorial and that's going to be like way even more eye opening for everybody about other challenges from that apartment really cool so it sounds like %HESITATION bus he has a really strong culture of empowerment and just education Ryan %HESITATION especially around roles so I'm really curious what your stance is or not even stand just how you think about hiring from the outside versus promoting from within  I mean I I mean in terms of management stuff ideally were promoting within like and that's always a deal I think  where is my situation right now where no one is nineteen must remain under the only designers I would talk to them all back and everyone just like I'm good I wanna be it's not gonna be senior designer on the stuff is either like they're all like on that track and they want nothing to do with what we do so no choice like wanna hire manager like if we need a manager kind of host we have to go outside %HESITATION  but ideally like our mean it would be great to be able to cultivate that internally because you it's just like %HESITATION number one I got at the I was I came into the from the outside as a design angelic came in as a manager  %HESITATION  and at the same time two of the designs are promoted to design it with the first three design managers at C. like that ever existed outside of Randy %HESITATION  and those two in the two people can NJ either to design injures and been there for awhile like they've been there for a year to Jay for law a little bit longer  a lot of trust RT builds up like this afternoon with a word they they do their work they knew how they interacted with each other and so what we wound up doing was like I took on no designers when I started and they split the team in half because like that was just like it was so much more effective that way they know how to let go because this person  they knew who they were and so over time I went up like  I will design work for a while building Trussell Hey it's hard to build out minister to hire people for my team in line into the teams I was on and eventually like was managing people but %HESITATION yeah I mean it's always better that way because they are you know who they are and there's no there's no tears buildup record everything that you mentioned you mentioned that %HESITATION  in the design team right now there are a lot of people who wanted to just take the road route of you mention staff designer senior product designer %HESITATION which is awesome and I think there's %HESITATION underlying question there which is  how do you see  the progression of a designer's career because there many companies where for designer they think that in order to move up they have to become a manager yeah right and %HESITATION but in reality you actually like that if that company yeah but in reality there is another route that so we can take right but it's not really the find an established and some really curious to hear how you think about it and what you're doing here a dusty to actually allow someone to say I don't want to be a manager I want to be something else right yeah I yeah they're like people become managers because they can they have to and they're terrible I don't think that this is a very common tell you take your most talented designer talented engineering you make them a manager and also in all your productivity goes away and people are passed because they're bad and like everything goes wrong simultaneously you know and the managers frustrate because they can't write code in light or do the design work in like yes just all huge mass and it's because you didn't create that structure %HESITATION so the way it is nineteen is leveled is that the manager and is on track for paralyzed arms they're not they don't stock there like on top of each other if I miss a lot of places are like it's stacked words like Sears liner creative director whatever it's because of this thing %HESITATION for us it's like you know a product designer seniors understaffed liner principles and %HESITATION we we aren't we have defined roles because they exist but we just don't know how anybody that's knocking on doors and as we haven't taken the time to make some real but then the staff designer role is the Cleveland to them angeal manager all like that's like design manager with mail for five people part and I'm like that's the same levels stock designer and like a prince was one of the senior manager and so on a thing %HESITATION and so and actually like the designer levels go up to him trying to remember  I think they go up to the look like to my level like that just the potential like that that that track it's not friendly principle is your level no it keeps going beyond that like there's like principle would be the equivalent of like a cry of %HESITATION director level gotcha interesting and and is this level like compensation power seven are like a power  influencer like yeah I mean yeah it's it's well it's skill influence on both tracks right  %HESITATION they mainly to find it and pass the stop sign %HESITATION roles like me is no ones and I right now we have a few senior designers who are working on the staff role and I mean as you go up in any of them either track like things become more broader nebulous and more about leadership and like %HESITATION identification problems and solutions falling more than it is about the like actual design works a certain point like if your senior designer like you keep getting better as a designer you know over time but it's like pretty good we trust you with almost anything I can give you a project like I know that's not what I'm worried about is like our like are you saying like %HESITATION we don't have design principles for visual design system I maybe we should do that and that's what we want that level of designer to do that the managers like we're doing now but should be doing you know so senior designer is pretty common at this point what does a was a principal designer  well the staff is is after  senior and I we haven't defined the principal role okay %HESITATION  I mean I would imagine it's more cross departmental like influence where you're working directly with other departments to like identify their needs to like ahead of time or to think deeply understand that department %HESITATION so someone who works on tools for our business team right on that team like  the poll designer in that role wouldn't know the entire business like every piece of it when would always be in communication with that like with it you know I mean it's like it's more again it's a great everything I think becomes more important some super important my role to know as much about everything is possible right claims will make those like mental connections when they come up is a similar thing I think for designers like as you at understanding of the business and of like the departments that you work with is like just has to get deeper over time  %HESITATION as well as our inputs on the nineteen right at large so so can we reach out to our community and we asked them to tell us what's on their mind and what they want to know about the most we have five questions that we want to go through with you right %HESITATION so here's here's the first question how do you explain the role of design to people at buzzfeed  I don't is one thing maybe in  I is like I said I can't talk about them I talk about the mess of it I think everybody I'm running to be the doesn't understands that like the core kind of function as a designer like the kind of like %HESITATION they they work on I've seen where princess person maybe and I've seen lately see artifacts and kind of understand that dot like kind of like code that we make and make some artifacts that go into a process that we work on together something %HESITATION  but I don't feel like I don't know that I ever really feel the need to like have to make them understand like unless again like the engineers understand very deeply without anybody Clinton because they work with there's all time and the designer bring with them based  that is  sorry  and the designers bringing with them based on the role they know they have right and like that kind of thing in the messiness that they bring in terms of writing code so they bring that into the team and so they don't have to really explain it very often %HESITATION so I don't know I I don't  I don't know I don't know the answer the question I don't have an error on to really do that  which means that it's  sorry whoever asks a question  how is the design team organized a bus we'd  okay so there is  does he have a product on the team that I might help because that's how we're organized so there is a product nineteen it's non centralize like it's distributed into the teams they work with so we also they don't also we don't sit together since nineteen %HESITATION  so the part of a minority is there's a is the group a bunch of groups that work on consumer product it's like the apps the websites %HESITATION distributed stuff like our instant articles apple news like the let's account lives in a few groups that work on the stuff RCM asks like other editors used to publish on buzzfeed like that all lives with the consumer groups  and then we have a series of tooling teams are internal tooling teams that are at work on %HESITATION tools for our business unit sales in it the work on work flow tools for older video producers on to use to like published like to make and publish videos and then a learning tools in the works on more like  analytics tools like data analysis tools for content for the people to make stuff here to like I understand how their video did or how they're posted and how to like improve upon it and so designers are engineers and product people in designers are bad it into those areas  and  %HESITATION and working type team so they like working like for five people in a few couple engineers designer product person are working on that thing together %HESITATION everyone's while like the shuffle obviously depending on need and business strategy and stuff like that but that's basically the organization %HESITATION like design managers that like  the manager civic groups and his eyes and his group since that's like so that they are also semi accountable for the output now comes from the groups themselves so strong managers managing random designers from different places they're managing them directly %HESITATION because that's the group that they manage  I'm going to put yourself in the shoes of someone who might be the only designer in their business and then he he merry go how do you convince the leadership in the business of the value of designed I there's a couple things I think the first thing to know is if you got hired as a designer they must value something they must value it so in some way I think it's mostly about again like the perception of what you do maybe might be different than what you're perception us of what you do  %HESITATION although like  you should bring that up maybe in the in the interview process  %HESITATION here now it's like I I guy %HESITATION I don't think I've ever been blindsided by a I mean I've worked at three different start ups as the only designer and all three of them and I don't think any point was ever like man like this you don't understand what I'm doing here like they all definitely knew what they were hiring before we talked about an interview process then even thinking a couple named taught me some stuff that I should be doing and I didn't know I should be doing %HESITATION  it's a like a date you can kind of issue vetting that head of time  but then trust that like if you got hired they value you because they're they did it they're paying you they maybe they heard they needed designers they hire them hired you but then  like  they are paying you to be there so they they want to get the most value out of using its fought like proving that what you have to bring to it is valuable to the business  how do you measure and present design results of buzzfeed yeah so they're not we don't measure design results we measure product result like product outcome so like we do a lot of A. B. testing %HESITATION some product managing maybe testing like tooling team and select open enough like about a year %HESITATION is with tooling lets people run AB test pretty simply on buzzfeed although like all the consumer products on Twitter that right %HESITATION feel like we've we've done great I think it's great design work that performs extremely poorly %HESITATION and we've done because I work I think it's just kind of okay that performs pretty well like and it's kind of like you know  and at the end of the day I mean I am not here to make designs custom here we're all here for buzzfeed to be successful right we're here to make a business successful and if we're making calls based on our ego or based on our discipline that that's probably not a good idea %HESITATION and then the telling teams we do what we like those teams are very hyper connect all of their like users are internal girl here right there all the building or they're all in an office and the office in a layer in the U. K. and %HESITATION  so they are tight tight like communication with those teams and they are working on this tools like testing the schools of those teams like giving them early looks things to play with them and like givens and came back and like that's like kind of user happiness and life of the business tools like kind of what they're measuring instrument unofficial a we're trying I'm hiring he's a researcher this year that I want to work on like making a little more measured for those teams I think that's like I would be really useful for them to not be kind of guessing about where they're out with that %HESITATION yeah so they could design successes and like a metric it's more about the again like that output of like engineering and design and product and what is the result of that we get in with this last one as  the function of design continues to evolve %HESITATION what are some roles and methodologies that you think will emerge over the next five years  %HESITATION I think as I will be a lot more invisible over time is something that thinking a lot lately %HESITATION I mean you look at stuff like Alexis %HESITATION or  the home and it's just like the first things %HESITATION %HESITATION like some designing those systems I know some of those designers and like you'll never see it's not visible you'll never see it it's a system like there's a system designed happening that like the design things extremely useful %HESITATION it like someone thinking about that experience and how the what the flow is of like if someone says this kind of thing how do we respond in like what's the track of that %HESITATION  %HESITATION  that's something I think a lot of people are designers don't know how to do first of all I got deep system thinking is something it's just like a lot of companies make you do like I don't know that we do much of that you're busted outside of the internal tooling something gets really insane sometimes the light because their products are like it's not and it's not super complicated like system problem you know I mean like there's not it's not a deep deep white group problem that we're solving %HESITATION so those are gonna be really interesting jobs I mean like like that will only grow it will become more complex and require more designers to think about it longer you know %HESITATION have I don't even know what methodologies we can bring to that you know is probably that's always been thought of that were using old methodologies to try to solve this these problems with %HESITATION A. R. is gonna be really weird I'm like pretty pumped for there was a movie are like I don't know how many are guy how many are and how many are guys here that's good I like the arts cool like it's fun I mean if I watch a movie or video play video games as need to like %HESITATION augments yeah yeah but I don't like that word yeah like I would love to like and you can imagine like  having having no screen no computer screen and just like doing all your work like that's going to be a whole other thing you know I got it again like complete ever methodologies thinking about things completed from way %HESITATION  site yeah that's the thing I'm really excited about  now  well well thanks so much thanks a lot  he made it to the end congratulations thanks for watching the episode I really really hope you liked it if you did like it please leave us a review on the iTunes store and by the way if you have any questions that came up because of the content that that we covered with our guests going you to go on Twitter you can tweet us you can leave us a comment we'll get back to you will help you as much as possible at high rise podcast that's the the screen name or the handle for Twitter for Instagram for Facebook find us talk to us we want to converse with you out we're not going to leave here by the way without also thinking our friends at sorrel video they've been an amazing park on this entire project to Sir %HESITATION video is a creative studio based out of Portland Oregon they've helped creative communities tell stories for over ten years they've done advertisements behind the scene footage %HESITATION in documentaries for companies like Google slack XO XO festival adobe Intel they're incredible they've traveled with us through the entire country documenting these stories with our guests that's incredible thank you so much sorrow listen if your start up looking to elevate your product your big company looking to humanize your brand you're someone in the creative community you just want to tell a story you've gotta check out the team at several video it's Searle video dot com S.
