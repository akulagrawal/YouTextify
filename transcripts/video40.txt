Hey everybody it's Chris around here with Jose and we're gonna be talking about US design how do you turn you X. design into a website is what I want to know I think that's what you guys want to now so we're gonna roll with that stick around guys because again I want you guys to listen to me yeah I designed sandwiches my name is so sick I yet and I talk about the business of this is  a lot of stuff my name's Cristo and talk about the business of design at the center of this operating system to understand as a %HESITATION just some of the show title is I hate you did you were watching the process  we got a couple  we hope that they're going to chime in  so what exactly is  got it so the question is what exactly is your child read the question down read it out and then put it you keep going  so one of the challenges in defining you access simple as that %HESITATION I was using the metaphor of a film when you say you know what a film as people think of the end product which is you know moving pictures with music and dialogue in this emotional how when you say filmmaking which is all the components are going to film making things like you know %HESITATION the cinematography that that that set design the script be %HESITATION all of what what else casting cascine what else you guys are direction production design book bags storyboards all the facts all those things collectively our film making %HESITATION so when it's the process so you X. describes  a collection of activities that you do in order to create primarily in digital devices %HESITATION experiences for users which is what people call somebody who uses a digital device so I everything from research to %HESITATION to the actual definition of what you're doing to customer profiles to the actual design of that you I have the user interface itself visual design %HESITATION user testing development all of it falls under user experience now user experience design the actual definition of a user experience  is what we're going to talk about today talaga answer yeah excellent  Chris the goal we want to do today and %HESITATION I think your screen is actually working %HESITATION is too we're working on a real project so we're going to be working on the school's website to school rocks all common put that yeah so if you can pull that up and what I want to do today is to take %HESITATION the the user profile so we have and we're going to talk about them briefly and then we're gonna start sketching out a home page and I want people to understand because I'm gonna talk it I'm gonna do it out loud I'm actually %HESITATION talk to my process so that people understand how I'm taking those and what it is and I'm doing with with the customer profiles in order to get to that so this is the current China and Japan side  so we've got we get a lot of compliments on the side and on what what it does we also get a lot of questions about where can we get your product missile tiny link this is shop we also have a lot of disparate sites and a lot of different things that we're using %HESITATION so folk assets as founders Chris one of the goals that we're trying to accomplish why we re doing the actual website  we're trying to a communicate our product more clearly yeah  also trying to identify who our customers are we need to speak to them directly and solve their problems can if we can do that hopefully more people get interested in the products and the things we're doing so what he said is that he wants to fine tune and what I what I want to do two is fine tune what we're saying to our actual customers so we're discovering more and more who they are more specifically and then second we want to really highlight our products so that we can sell more and have the business increase in terms of %HESITATION that the financial aspects of right because it then today we believe in the product that we are making building in developing and we want to make sure that the people are audience that were speaking to understand what it is that we're doing because if not there's a disconnect and then they will see the value great so let's start let's start with that so what we're gonna start with this too let's do two customer profiles %HESITATION that we already have really seen from all the feedback and all of the %HESITATION work that we do online meaning the interaction that we have with people who are those two %HESITATION an error and you know who they are %HESITATION who are they the two could primary customers that we have right now  %HESITATION the freelancer  and  what else  %HESITATION the Asians are a lot of gaps  and I want to do something that's truncated today because what's interesting is that %HESITATION in how we do user experience we define a customer and a story %HESITATION the demographics the story what their challenges or obstacles are and what their needs are in order to meet those but let's just distill it down to those two things that's distillate to if it's really basic like if we were to do real quick up here just the name and age and then the only two things that I think would be interesting to do is what other challenges  so what's their story like what's your story morning glory and then in order to meet those challenges you can column solutions you can column needs you can call me whatever you want let's actually column solutions just for fun just so it is really specific in how we do it in our product called core we call this needs Chris because it's in the slightly different but it's all the same thing here's their story like what's the story of this particular user all right Chris so let's give an age how old is this person we were here once early thirties early thirties so thirty three sure okay mail we have built up a whole profile now we're just gonna give you my name ten three letters them with the college ten ten Carson making that are very  right and that he what what are the challenges that he's having now we're basing this I'm gonna get back on camera here we're basing this on you we're basing this on what we're seen every time that you buy a school product ask you specifically I email back and say why did you buy the product what towns are going through if you bought one that is on the comments in you most of you let's say ninety percent answer question what are the challenges are going through Chris  challenges are going through is there there transitioning from being a freelancer works for other companies to having their own clients and what they want to do is graduate basically from working out of their home studio into having office and having some employees that could be an intern or maybe a junior designer Parcells person they want to wear out and need to grow because at this phase in their life at thirty three there's there either merry war about to have a kid or something like that and so their financial needs are much different today than they were when they were in their twenties  after doing  and and there's one other times and they were always pose which I had and you've had when you're doing digital projects what happens when the digital projects get bigger it becomes an wielding I'm wielding they become complexity and pain so people are really scared of it my way scared of it and the reason I start I I really think the schools what we do is important because it's all about the pain and I think one of the challenges they also have is there they wonder is there a better way what can I do this better  like how do you get from doing five to ten thousand all the websites to forty fifty a hundred two hundred thousand on the website so they can see  well and also and also be able to track their clients I love that so so so growth complexity is there a better way and I will call it also big major clients right so this transition real quick into solutions %HESITATION what our solutions or what do they need in order to be able to and I like what Cristo talks about where it's like **** for tat so they can you need to translate this term by the way **** for tat is my turn okay transition from small to larger what is he needs to grow what does he need for complexity what does he mean is there a better way what does he need like can we say what are the things that the solutions for those problems yeah let's go let's go let's go all right so the first one I said and you guys enjoy your time and all right Archie what if you need in order to transition from small to extra large what do you need to get your practice to be bigger  its clients  the sales on our clients source yells process the ball great awesome thank you so much sales process appreciate that  and  attention if you're watching this pay attention to my languages I'm facilitating because your job as a designer to level up is to do the same thing I'm doing so I say thank you very much great awesome idea give me another one go increase is mine and what we time I know what it takes to grow and to increase sales process what else does he need to grow ten Carson ten needs to  this is a tricky one we had this call the other day we had this call with with with man we have this call with %HESITATION at least and they are told us I can't remember what what other things is how do you generate enough lead to like what are the activities that you can do I need to marketing to grow outside of your sales process it is a little bit because marketing as a lead Jen it's but it's in there let's highlight it I thought I was under the same umbrella that's what is one thing okay so yeah so marketing we want to okay okay that's a really good point  one it's sometimes better to be more granular sales process might be too broad okay so let's call it %HESITATION marketing  and promotions correct  they're slightly different but I like marketing promotions so for complexity in pain it is a good job %HESITATION get John Cristo where you're also makes them feel better about  I know you didn't get a lot  we appreciate it all right so it's an excellent offer complexity in pain what it what does he need what what would you need in order you been doing web a lot or shop if I hire more people lasting for me  okay that's a great one so what do you need in order to hire people and to put him to work %HESITATION able to manage  and it's already maybe on like maybe the weights on my so you need to hire and manage people okay so hires  and managed teams okay and what in the fear is that it gets painful with that says let's just leave those three and I just don't you need to be able to manage complexity in pain that you need a clearly defined process data with the client perfect alright you Chris so you're welcome thanks I feel validated for  your process  awesome so just with those three let's just do this exercise just with those but one thing that that I wanted to point out and we can do the is how are we doing on time and we could do that another one real quick so we do agency how hard the agency problems different is a person gonna be a little older maybe a little bit let's do a thirty eight thirty eight and female male as well and %HESITATION Ellen Ellen that's a good name now and %HESITATION  staffer look great  excellent so let's give her some challenges what challenges does she have  and if you have challenges out there or if you can relate with the youths profiles let us know in the comments what are your child as well which is a good out of thirty eight grown an agency I mean I had some of these you have family responsibilities %HESITATION you have partners now  you probably hit a ceiling and you're you're you're trying to figure out how to get the next level so maybe your three to five people and what started out to be a great ramp is now kind of petered out and sub plot tough yeah you hit a plateau he spoke  a U. T. H. I'm gonna be like that Patto did %HESITATION in sales are in size in size so you have a certain amount of projects cash flow I've heard that like how to manage  cash flow what else  it's not that different than what Tim Tim going through and that he is dealing with particular products and he need to grow up he needs to grow they just need to grow with even bigger projects it's just a similar problem but just on a different scale are different scale but also their overwhelming because it's so much now that they're they used to be designers another being managers so in a way that the the the they're overwhelmed so managing over one or managing  which is with those three managing  overwhelmed with this space as are getting bigger think you have a low a bigger player so it's much more competitive competition  so this is where you competitions where you begin having to do things like you need to position yourself within your competition %HESITATION to grow and then managing overwhelm is also about a system my station sis %HESITATION nice station so now you have a bigger kitchen so many solutions all right so what are some solutions for this  again we call this means  there's other ways another thing there's a tons of ways to name these categories and there's different ways that you can learn how to do this all of them are really about identifying who the customer is what the challenges are and how can you solve them and then creating a user experience based on Chris let's just throw three solutions real quick okay so what we're talking about maybe similar they could be dissimilar what's the the solutions to my tone size one size cash flow problems manageable one system the station competition for cash flow contract structure can help solve that  right you can get paid more frequently and  after payment schedule bigger %HESITATION have delivery and delivery payments plateau in size that means that you need to grow your  projects sizes with what is I mean in order for me to charge more what I need to be able to do it up to them to higher value higher value higher  so that's really sales sales %HESITATION tools and like for example this thing decks and that's also positioning  it's a big one  what about what corner and out  and and and and I'm using a fairly thick sharpie even didn't get it to be thick enough I I need to I wanted to get the really thick one and that's because it needs to look good on camera but also because of your in %HESITATION in a room people are going to be way over the room we want everybody to see this and to give you approve on this all right let's just take these here's a big thing once you have a lot of these and you might have ten of these because there's ten people in the room I might have you know ten of these what do you do next privatize privatized  I choose three completely arbitrarily here's why at the end of the day you can't necessarily build everything you want actually really final things through priorities you also want to push people to choose priorities it doesn't mean that the seventh wanting an answer to be addressed it means that if we have to cut it and we go back and say look you selected these various parties is okay and this becomes part of the next phase that's why goes into scheduling we you you about when you say arbitrarily you about you and about you say like what seems like the most pressing challenge and solution that we can provide and then we would see like everybody seems like in being agreement the top ones always easy number two is pretty easy the third one coming on that's where the facilitator may come in it's like I'm here  these two things I think it's for this and then you got into the process K. yeah it's like a hot option is like okay whose most for this one  okay all right so now let's go on to choosing let's just  choose to per category even the three is a good one so out of %HESITATION the story challenges and it's Chris and I were let's say we're all here transition from small to extra large totally  one of the big things %HESITATION complexity in pain is there a better way growth increase revenue these are similarly source similar complexity in pain what would be the next most important one  in terms of their challenging yeah  well the transition from small to extra large is a big broad topic yeah so that's probably when you say let's get more granular we should have done that because we were at four five so what's it what do I think the transition point some of them here so let's say the transition is the main priority %HESITATION so it's basically this let's just let's just consolidate battle kind one %HESITATION I think let's just used let's use growth and complexity so what I'm doing is as a facilitator for the sake of being able to move forward I'm saying the top two that we have here which is the transition to growing our growth and complexity in pain we're gonna use those to %HESITATION as %HESITATION the main ones been here basically we would have marketing and promotions a clear process it's a solution for this and this too  sales and marketing I'm consolidating them into one  it's not fair for everybody  yeah yeah okay so for the agency cash flow is a big one do we all agree both boom and then  I think so here we have complexity in pain here we  composition yeah exactly that we're thinking exactly same thing so for the agency we're gonna address cash one competition so then solutions higher so this one %HESITATION the the the person needs to contract structure and positioning are the solutions to those two great so they're slightly different and there's a okay to do that because now that if you're addressing it from here you're also going to dress for this customer so there's a lot of %HESITATION push sometimes from clients to do a lot of customer profiles we need to do ten because we have all these different over customers at the end of the day you don't need to do that many because a lot of the needs get highlighted by one  baby do statistics you know that there's a sample size a smaller sample size well that's kind of yeah that that the more complex a site is the more profiles rebuild for something like this to seem to be just fine right yeah your billing one three is an airline  that's a lot different types of users right you still want to have true but you still want to archetypal primary customer profiles okay like for example virgin %HESITATION I I mereka isn't for everyone it's for like young professional I don't mean it like that I mean there might be the mom of the professional planner the gal agent guy slice of their different archetypes between three and five ten or fifteen customer profiles in the speech tonight will be what I usually do is I might do them with the customer like new eight I've done this and then look at all of them and said what are the similarities and consolidated them into five or into three all right so now let's do this rain I mean we have one over here already pre cut but let's just drive again and you can do this in many many different ways  so what's the question Chris that you would have when it comes to Jose how do you deal with translating and now onto a screen  well there was a  to do this so I don't even know  okay do it so I'll describe a couple of things one the format like mobile or like web is really dictated you guys answer this very well by the customer actually so I give with this this is we need our goal is right now for two to our main site right up the score a second so the format is a website %HESITATION and that means that there's a bunch of different already acceptable formats to select from so you do that from research and from preference all right so let's say you're the client Christian me other clients how do we want our website to look structurally  with me we wanted to be a long page sales page on like a long sales page one like in the film you want on it okay so there's not made a decision as to what kind of pages so that means that we have a hero mom like the top and then we're gonna have multiple modul sick on the sales process all right so let's talk about that and I'm gonna go over here and I'm gonna look actually some other parts of the process so the reason why all of this stuff I like to have it all up at one time is because when you have a team in the room in your facilitating if you have the definition of the brand if you have you know who the customer profiles are and if you have your business goals you can immediately look at all of them because you're actually designing designing live with your actual customer in the room sometimes you can be doing this with your team you could be doing this with your design or you could be doing this with your developers but if you're I I agree designer and graphic designer who's used to sitting on their desk in a dark room which I've seen this when I walk into some studios working on your staff getting feedback from a manager behind you know %HESITATION your shoulder  this is not that this is actually everybody working together to come up with a design the design and this is a  and where does is this designers is just like a sketch on a piece of paper  in this exercise we have the things that they're gonna have us objections is this for me does it work and what is it exactly so in the sales process you're going to have this is to capture attention appear  this topic because that's what you see what's the next thing Chris gonna be objection ones which is is this for me this is the qualification  and in terms of this vision making what do we literally put into a sale site like this that we already have like right here well usually this next section is to self select audience yes you have to tell you who you are then you can say this is me self selection yes so does this sound like I'm a freelancer an agency if it does then I'm gonna keep going if not so basically is for the freelancer the freelancer  I'm gonna discuss it in like that real quick so for the second time and here is the agency  and what am I gonna have below it I'm gonna have what that means so I'm gonna have %HESITATION the challenges so you're looking to grow you're looking to do X. Y. Z. so let's actually defined those real quick but I'm gonna talk about my process  up here you're getting the value proposition the value proposition is basically what is the shortest way for me to say Hey what are your needs  so if you look at these and the specific needs of  those are usually the value proposition meaning you could have the value proposition B. the challenge like what is the challenger having for example %HESITATION grow your design business  I'm basing that on  so if I were to highlight a value proposition from here also we have been in the you know confidence grow is one of the attributes we have in our value %HESITATION it when we did the brand attributes so its growth right  would it be fair to just test out about proposition  grow  your  design business  which is super simple  and click yes maybe so let let me just point this out here %HESITATION as I'm reading a book on copywriting the headline is was a grab your attention got an appeal to the person self interest yes so a lot of designers make a mistake they just talk about themselves and I don't really care about you yes you can help me solve my problem I'm moving on to the next site yes so I'm a design business I want to grow great more detail this is what I sound like and this is what I look like right so do you want to do you want to %HESITATION increase so here you would go increase  you know sales might be one of them that might not be the first one we try not to talk about the challenges okay so are you struggling to grow your design practice and  whatever else you've written up struggling to grow is to come our projects getting more complex and painful %HESITATION is there but is there a better way boom this is the three entry points that you're gonna have right there I'm taking them directly from my customer profile into the copy so who do you have in the room and  we have a larger team yeah you know you're gonna have copywriters you're gonna have art directors again about the people I saw for the agency %HESITATION casual competition positioning what are the questions that we're gonna ask you agency  if you %HESITATION do you know heavy plateaued and you know it's like so %HESITATION had hit a ceiling had hit a ceiling  the ceiling %HESITATION process to complete it %HESITATION %HESITATION  it is a hardened up differentiate  between your competitors or something like that I have a hard time differentiating between our competitors %HESITATION  managing complexity managing %HESITATION hiring matches the number one hiring and managing projects and managing projects okay so here was I mean the ceiling %HESITATION how are you an agency have you had a ceiling %HESITATION  are you having a problem hiring and and %HESITATION managing and hiring people and managing your projects so those are already questions yeah alright so in the third one here what we what are we gonna give them here  to order the objection to  was a junction to press well is this for me is this some identifying right right and then does this really work what is it exactly that means anyone maybe what is this what is this okay so basically this would be the solution I like what is is it alas okay what is right objection objection I you got me really interested not tell me exactly what it is so does it work %HESITATION %HESITATION the question there however different ways to actually answer the doesn't work question you have you have testimonials you have what is you have %HESITATION what is a call that product medical data metaphysical should prove social  for the %HESITATION for that freelancer for the agency  for the for the sake of of %HESITATION of arguments to two things a step backwards when you want to do the product last yeah okay so we're near last near last so %HESITATION anecdotal or like %HESITATION %HESITATION  testimonials so here you could say marks  you can say I increased you know  my sales  by X. percent  you have a picture of the person and then here you have the support %HESITATION I've been agency you know we reposition  and grew  our agency yada yada yada and after that form so you can change this model to different places but this is already basically saying here the things that I did and the incentive was saying here's a public benefits are here the benefits immediately having somebody I'll say it and Chris is %HESITATION drying the people which is %HESITATION as something that you can actually do in the that and the and the pro in the in the sketch I've been lucky but you can get really you can you can have a logo %HESITATION so what else can we do Chris here so the next thing is does it really work as a for me what is it exactly now you get to what it what it is okay so what is it what is it what is it so here we can have the different products now we know what those are because we have them in the dryer those yeah so yeah so the product is a kit you gonna get you have two kids you have %HESITATION agency kit and you have a core main strategy K. so there's a booklet  yeah  you can keep  no doubt drawn so so so so there you want to have what I call again to for tat so you have the two problems then you have some of it and you can put product benefits instead of testimonials there you put the testimonials afterwards you're going to have to actually test different ways of doing this landing page coming up with it is not a finite process so I am a graphic designer Chris is a graphic designer by training we didn't get taught this at school right did you get taught this is school not how to go from a customer profile all the way to copy like I didn't think I was a good copy writer even but what I heard Chris saying I'll do a testimony on Chriss be happy said as  before I didn't know how to write copy now I know exactly how to write to that particular customer and we all know how to read English most of us to at least %HESITATION because of the customer profiles so in user experience what's the first word in user experience user user so everything is focused around this now again the reason why the process is set up so that over here with the camera over here you have all your variables like  your brand is who your way around is who your users are and what your goals are and then you move on to the center which is where you're actually sketching some of the solutions putting up the boards of your solutions and then on the other side you have the actual execution and I and I noted this to everyone to the audience earlier the reason why you have all three when you're developing software and we shall be no this pretty well why is that the you would have you would have the input the what you produce and the output all next to each other visually  you can reserve  allies exactly how it will look and like exactly  what are you waiting for yeah you can visualize everything and you can move with an entire team through the process and it's gonna change that's the reason why all these tools like stickies and Chris said you know at the beginning that you is because you can reposition everything %HESITATION that's why I use these it's a living process so when you see it %HESITATION Google an image of Google's design process when you see an image of a software company %HESITATION %HESITATION and it has all the stickies and all these things and you know white boards it's because design is no longer about this idea of an end product design is now about this I look at that man Krista should do like life sketching at conferences so you have the two products this look awesome  beautiful metaphor like an iPad I had wrote that's really awesome nice job do that you should be it should be the designer yeah it should be designers on that so I'm gonna end with this quote from Steve Jobs creativity is just connecting things when you ask creative people how they did something they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it they just saw something some connections between things it seems obvious to them after a while  Chris well yes we can put it back to you you always ask me how what you know what's your process that you're going through  what did you get out of this this is even help at all  I think there's a big gap between these profiles that you guys build from using core and then not connecting it to that there seems to be a pretty big gap between you guys doing this and then doing that because they did a very good job of take isn't showing you exactly how we structure and it's all through the lens of the customer user centered design is all about  the user the customer and so some talk about yourself talk sometime I your software and hardware in less that's a question that they have that's a challenge that what hardware do use them talk about that but in most cases it's not this is where your skills and empathy are going to matter a lot yet to pay attention to what the customers want and need and the solutions that are going to solve that in phrase in a way that they can absorb the story what do what do you guys think reflect on they they may not know as a student right %HESITATION I guess I was wondering so here you're focusing on one single page elemental  how user experience fits in with the rest of the design process websites including like the site's structure and like what other pages there are you know like how is are there steps that that might come before doing this landing page that are also part of the last second question that's the next episode we're dealing with taxonomy side structure %HESITATION based on actual customer profiles privatization like what features are in it what features are out %HESITATION planning all those things are part of it and you use a similar process can ask a follow up question to what you're asking  now he got his **** in the very beginning what's the structure of the site and in a couple years ago is multiple pages and lots of things to do at there has been a shift towards something that is kind of more like easier for somebody to use and is a story in itself and full to us by scrolling down it's very easy and can be driven by the client so there's nothing for them to get confused by call to action would be at the bottom here so each one of these things is a little store that takes him through  the customer journey and we we do the call to action so that  consolidation of one page yeah it's all on one page versus by that's necessary system though you have a link to go to the E. commerce store you have links to go to a landing page for the products so we worked on that %HESITATION we shop and I worked on that on what's called the product architecture or it's called %HESITATION in this case you know %HESITATION there's a bunch of different departments vendors that we're using to build the site like different services so you have to actually define that a large part of that is functional bike okay when somebody clicks on by where do they buy we build any commerce page do we actually use the service so there's a lot of questions that dovetail with the technical so I'm collaborating with Rashad's computer science major %HESITATION from UCLA and he and I are discussing the pros and cons of the platforms that we use and then we dry out like a diagram of all the different platforms that's a technical architecture issue now becomes what's on everyone of those pages so we repeat this process on each of those pages what's the format what needs to be on it the best thing to do is to copy existing formats in creativity that's like whoa you don't want to copy somebody else's work because he works about originality when it comes to function all aspects of a website there are things that are proven to work and you want to have those general structures take this structure you take the structure you can change the color you can change fonts concert all these different things going with the structure on a little bit but you don't want to necessarily be the guy who has this unique thing because it's not necessarily about how it looks visually as how it displays on a format like on a phone which is thing about car cars four wheels the steering wheel drive dear motor and it needs to work the same from manufacturer to manufacturer they're copying each other structure  everything else about the experience is different the way it looks the way it runs the way it sounds everything's different but we do have a problem with that and I'm glad you brought that up because designers like now I'm gonna reinvent the web limit web four point out this one designers thing and then they create a complete disaster doesn't function they spend all their time re engineering something they didn't need to be fixed  now the time that you do that is maybe there's new emerging technology %HESITATION platforms you have to start thinking about that's the time to think about new structures yeah he had it on the net like response yeah now now everybody's on mobile devices and then you're designing for two three screens at a time so that's what's driving the function and structure thank you guys if you have questions about user experience ask below what other episodes about user experience you want to see what is a valuable topic  how did we do how are we doing you like my hat I don't know whatever you want to comment on below and what else should strive to like this video if you like it and comment share it and said we'll see you guys next time
