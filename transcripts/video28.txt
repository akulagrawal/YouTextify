he was losing money by the ocean and I'm jade around it  every single week we sit down with a master of design every week is that any different nope we look at our phones were like what's the number one app we use every day Instagram dull and so we're Instagram you know who is speaking to speak with ins Walter is the head of design here at Instagram he's gonna tell us about his experiences working in agency and coming over to start a plan gonna tell us how to build designs the maturity is gonna tell us how an apt the size of Instagram innovate so quickly and before we cut to break we just have to ask you guys for one favor to favors follow us on Instagram add up and iris podcast and if you like this pocket to be getting any value out of this podcast the number one way you can show us that you're getting value if you're listening to this on a podcast app is to review it and read it okay we'll ask for an objective review and rating yep that's it we're gonna go to break we're

one word for ten percent off your first purchase  the end thanks for joining us sure thanks for having me so first question what's one thing about the signed it's clear to you that you don't think this is for other people  I think it's becoming clear to me about design %HESITATION is that  the way you structure your company is equal to or more important than any sort of like process or talent when it comes to the quality of output right so %HESITATION in which is designed sit within your organization %HESITATION there is it something that's equal to %HESITATION technology engineering and product or is it something that sits under those those functions %HESITATION you know how do you incentivize and reward people you know do you reward based off of the %HESITATION the amount of work or how quickly it's done or or do you %HESITATION actually were people based off of some sort of way of measuring the quality flick it's out there it's a live all these other things that aren't usually considered designee things that you don't like learn in design school I think have a tremendous impact on the quality of work that comes out %HESITATION so yeah I think that's something that's become more clear to me designing your design team design your company designing your company right you know design hearing is ation and like what what what are the principles that your organization works within around how do you allocate resources are you planning center a lot of that stuff that happens before what we would consider to be a part of the normal design process has a tremendous impact on the quality of work that gets done so something that's interesting about you is your maybe the only gas of our twenty five guys to spend as much time on the agency side as the client side or you weren't RGA for a sixty eight year someone that %HESITATION I'm curious if if  the agency world informs your process in different ways and actually thinking about it %HESITATION how how do you think the teams are designed in the in the agency world different to what you're experiencing out Instagram sure so yeah I think %HESITATION when the  best parts about being desires needs he is like the %HESITATION the variety of work with you to work on you to tackle lots of different design problems in business problems like in a very short period of time %HESITATION you're working around lots of creative people %HESITATION where the kind of %HESITATION the capital is ideas yeah it's not necessary like what the impact of those ideas are necessarily it's just being generative right so you you you you learn a lot there %HESITATION you learn about the connection between Brandon product in in just the concept of Brandon that like that and what that means %HESITATION so there's a tremendous amount that I think I've I've benefited from by going deep with with various companies %HESITATION I can ninety X. at our %HESITATION %HESITATION and that I've tried to bring some of the good parts of what I've learned from working with those companies or working in a very design centered organization in and try to graph that on to working in like in house as you say but you know but like a technical organization or software organizations what are some of the opportunity cost to starting out your current agency versus client side of star yeah I think you have to take into account the context of time when I started %HESITATION you know there wasn't a tremendous amount of of design opportunities within software ticket was came up on the east coast to so that there's a little bit of difference there %HESITATION and I think that the because design practice within suffering musicians is a bit more mature now you can actually have like a full career you know working within %HESITATION whether it's in the start up world or in larger technical companies %HESITATION where is like that was a lot more established with an agency world like you can understand like I could start here and then eventually maybe I'll be be to a creative director now  it's kind of kind of equal I think %HESITATION opportunity because starting on the agency side is that there is definitely a leap between %HESITATION again being in this environment where the ideas matter verse is actually like execution and delivery matter in the impact of of high quality execution matter anymore %HESITATION the types of people that you collaborate with our different there's not like usually at product management role for instance in the agency world as in %HESITATION in in the kind of day talk to software world so %HESITATION there there are definitely some leads that you have to make to your will make that transition and how you kind of measure  whether this is a good piece of work %HESITATION is very different between the worlds right like a good piece of work in in need sea world might be what client really liked it or it's sold through work we got business because of it we're as good piece of work here might be something that that's that's sort of %HESITATION may be smaller but might have tremendous material impact on the business you have to like retool that on that so we do have people that we do hire you know that that's becoming more commented and bring people from the agency world over but everyone doesn't kind of make it over there everyone isn't as compatible with working this way yeah I do agree about the way that for a long time %HESITATION  it that the the the design work on the client side or in the software world wasn't sexy enough and so the the agency world really did turn out to be the the the spring ground for some of the best designers in the world today %HESITATION how does an agency think about brand differently to how you're thinking about brand out Instagram well I think it's pretty compatible now I think about an Instagram but like a lot of other companies yes it took a while from even think about the concept of  like what does it matter yeah like what you know and I think that %HESITATION the way he  agencies thrive off of brand because they're they're often in position where they're trying to help a company you know express ideas air communicate something and that means that they have to figure out ways of connecting to culture yeah right you know and and and and not just getting a message across are being useful but also being interesting right so there's there's all these other kind of pieces there %HESITATION and then I think that  also the what is brand kind of %HESITATION you know has evolved over time from my Marshall %HESITATION let's talk about brand is patterns and kind of more thinking about it more in the behavioral %HESITATION standpoint of thinking about how a he %HESITATION business behaves in terms or what their release what they say center over time being what brand is about and so it Instagram I think that what I've tried to take his thinking about both brand and what we consider to be product kind of at the same time and so even from team structure standpoint having people are thinking about brand brand identity sit with the people that or you can sometimes be the same person as thinking about how the I should look or how it should feel right so gnashing those things together and constantly having them influence each other I think is healthy %HESITATION and also just creates %HESITATION interesting work in and and I think unifies %HESITATION no matter where whatever kind of %HESITATION way you're interacting with Instagram that the dream and I think we're there yet sure %HESITATION all kind of feels the same hall comes it kind of feels like it's coming from the same %HESITATION small group by the same hand ideally but you know %HESITATION that's were shooting for so before Instagram you work that  for spring you too nominee join these companies when they were  Lester's armature  %HESITATION I'm curious what kinds of conversations you had a steak was there and how you went about actually bringing to sign to the conversation sure I mean %HESITATION both distinct environments both %HESITATION really special companies you know like a great engineering you know cultures etcetera and and also you know seen a lot of success I think to break them apart a little bit I think the four square %HESITATION when the main kind of contributions there was thinking about %HESITATION bringing in %HESITATION everything %HESITATION for for %HESITATION the customer you know it's very kind of visionary sort of company %HESITATION but bring in that the voice of people actually using force grabby day was was it was an opportunity that eyes are so thing doing things like commissioning some of our first research studies like a particular come more ethnographic style research studies %HESITATION which actually was influenced by some of the work that %HESITATION that Nike had done internally where they kind of just get inspired by you know the people that use their products write them making the first research hire full time in and allowing that person to to be successful so I think that was one way of changing what design means within the organization and then the other pieces which it less about conversations with stakeholders but more about involving how we did what we did %HESITATION you're running workshops with the sea and the room working with the team %HESITATION doing a lot of scope sketching you know and try to make that I'm a part of the process  in order to not just not %HESITATION take the work away from designer so much is helping people express their ideas visually and use that as an input to the design process  %HESITATION you know I think those people get intimidated when you put a sharp in their hand asking the draw something sometimes right %HESITATION but I think it also helps get the team on the same page and then %HESITATION than the designers process after that is a little bit more straight forward because they know what's in everyone's heads right so I feel like  %HESITATION put some of those experiments were helpful and carving out a space for the design team to to do better work %HESITATION me since I like to tell myself yeah you had a chance at RGA to work on I would say maybe the first truly consumer rise commercialized wearable right the Nike fuel band %HESITATION  were you did you did you have any experience to bring to bear on that project like how how did you know what the design and how to June because I remember I remember using it for the first time I was blown away right top down the way it looks the way it felt the way it works all of it was really cool %HESITATION but what were while you're working on that project what were some principles that you have to bring to bear to the jury so before we didn't feel man right there was %HESITATION ninety plus was I had already been there %HESITATION when I came in we done a redesign of like the web property and then %HESITATION we actually took ninety plus running and and %HESITATION and made it a full complete experience using GPS trip in in phones right into that whole Nike running experience was good precursor because you learned about what does it mean %HESITATION do you know when you contract your data and have like social experiences with that %HESITATION how does it doesn't change your behavior right what's important about that so it's kind of a good kind of learning ground at taking to the field and world world which is a lot more about we called like the everyday athlete  %HESITATION there's a  out of learning their thinking about how %HESITATION how this product fits into someone's day and what does it take to motivate people right you know like that having a goal sounds obvious now but having a goal that you're looking at every day matters a lot no making that really visible %HESITATION having like these behavioral triggers about the experience a lot of RGH contributions were in the U. I have of the mobile app and also thinking about that that longitudinal experience in like one of the principles that we had %HESITATION mind and serve a mantra was %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION phone keys wallet fuel band right you know it's like we how do you make something it's like this is another thing you have to take take with you but how do you make sure that you want to write so there's a level of making it fun and interesting yeah and then %HESITATION you come is like astro was %HESITATION coming they did all the industrial designed an awesome job there and then when there's lots of opportunities around thinking about how do you make it kind of part of your daily %HESITATION the rhythm of your daily life right yes thinking about will if you could sink via Bluetooth what sort of things could that unlock right so really there's this whole behavioral change concept that started with some of the earlier ninety plus work never able to broaden you know with feel bands and kind of owning almost the the hunger kind of full stack there %HESITATION in really thinking about was it take to get one yeah what for this to be a desirable thing because at that point before that is kind of a scarlet letter to where I put on there it's like turn my doctors making where something that says reminder that I'm over weight as opposed to  I mean that you actually want to wear that becomes a conversational piece right now %HESITATION and that is rewarding yeah how did you approach to be a real change because I mean it's fast they like the the concert and  yet another thing that I have to take with me in the morning and something that is synonymous with something that doctors give me that I don't want so you had two challenges itself making the thing that I really don't like likable and then reminding you to take it every morning  %HESITATION so what was that was this user research was just bringing people in like how did you guys figure that out incidents definitely research down around %HESITATION %HESITATION different ways of looking at %HESITATION what it means to be an athlete and how people incorporate %HESITATION kind of exercise or or you know how to how to make that fun is a part of their their lifestyle so there's certainly work to be done there but there's a lot more kind of inspirational into the process I think a lot of the credit goes to our partners at Nike then and they're very good at thinking about %HESITATION what makes an experience desirable right you know like and they're very eighteen into making something %HESITATION connect with culture and in great things that are kind of cool and interesting so they pushed us to kind of invent those things so be it like the reward systems being something you just looked at and you just felt it in your got like %HESITATION this is fun this is great right %HESITATION in multiple points during the process they pushed us more to kind of think about how can you make something feel more rewarding %HESITATION and this is our job to kind of executing figure that out yet suit if you're speaking to thousands of young designers which you are right now by the way %HESITATION how old would you  how would you tell them to think about weather's starting their career in the agency world I is more appropriate for them versus a in a software company or a client side company sure I think %HESITATION what one you may be useful bit there is that I think agencies often understood  end of story telling sure really well night in communication so if that's more of what you're interested in as opposed to kind of interaction and building product that's one way to kind of break it down and then I think also figuring out well maybe you don't know what your most passion about when it comes to design and may you need much more of a variety of experiences in the design challenges agency should be able to provide more upright in in a very short amount of time really where is making a commitment to you %HESITATION either start up or or you know larger suffer company like this %HESITATION you're going to go deeper right you're gonna get some really great technical skills as well and you're gonna have some impact on hundreds of millions of people right you know which is awesome but you got to have a taste for that you know %HESITATION and so you  depending on what feeds you think you're at in your kind of design journey yeah I think that's a good way to kind of break now and as the landscape and responsibilities of design continues to evolve %HESITATION what are some changes that you think will happen in the agency world  yeah I think agencies are narrates our to do this I think they're getting smaller more nimble on there obviously having real technical prowess is like kind of a  ace line for all agencies at this at this at this time I think one good thing is that %HESITATION you know the importance of being able to tell great stories %HESITATION no pun intended %HESITATION is is is is becoming more important it's just a different format right you know it's it's it's not %HESITATION something at you guaranteed attention from someone for like a thirty second spot necessarily but maybe it's an ongoing you know creation of stuff so becoming more agile having you know less overhead etcetera  be assisting some interesting things where every agency if they have a small specialty is trying to branch into something else and sure everyone's kind of do something else is definitely a %HESITATION the world in transition and %HESITATION but I but there's always going to be a role for  who are great storytellers and great communicators %HESITATION people who are like specialists in certain domains of you know %HESITATION graphic art communications etcetera that that in house me not to be able support completely %HESITATION and they'll be room for I think a small boutique shops that are just like you know killers at a certain area %HESITATION but I think larger agencies will will struggle that do you I'm I'm a little conflicted on this personally but do you think that so I get that on the communication and brand side %HESITATION the graphic design side agencies tend to be stronger %HESITATION they'd given the fact that now suffer companies are on this rapid prototyping %HESITATION mindset universe right %HESITATION especially you guys at Instagram and Facebook right %HESITATION  I wonder if agencies are actually equipped to be able to bring value to a software to make a product and a not a constant care you seem pockets of that right you know there's a shout out to working code in those guys you know they're they're doing some good work in is is a few different yeah smaller shops that are trying to focus on this %HESITATION and they're you know incorporating some of the same kind of skill sets and and ways of working %HESITATION but it's still there pulled in for pieces of it right now and and ends and it's rare that needs the world that you get on the whole thing  expensive for someone to do that and there's lots of reasons why you'd want if it's that important to you as a company that you need to have that in house %HESITATION but I think that you know those sorts of shops can be used as kind of the their overflow or there was a need fresh  ideas are there with their their ways that tech companies like that can get pulled in for sure %HESITATION but %HESITATION they ate even those guys are the in different boutiques that are doing this well are %HESITATION involving how they how they work rain how they position themselves very different  when you went into force where I need to but focus on maybe four square %HESITATION  when you were sitting down with the founders and talking about the potential of design %HESITATION what were you telling them what were those conversations  fax explicitly like sat down say like it's all designed right that there is definitely a you know in the process of looking for they knew they wanted someone to come in and and help the design practicing SO it that door was already open %HESITATION and so for me it was much more about figure out how to get in there and how to make that valuable %HESITATION than actually kind of like you know come into my design wrote if you you know yeah yeah gotcha cope what was the state of the design team when you join us  Oscar I four square %HESITATION small group of folks %HESITATION that had been there for awhile it say it's about you know was actually remember numbers like probably six seven people %HESITATION and %HESITATION pretty pretty mobile oriented you know and it's very it's a very mobile first company it always was it's almost nearly mobile means couple with guys %HESITATION and I think that they were pretty %HESITATION side load and so they they hadn't yet been like a real formulation of a design team you know they're designers of course they you know worked with each other and collaborated well X. at around but actually feeling  like a you know a team I end in in I think the level of collaboration wasn't as strong as it because it could be yeah and I think that was a big focus for me is like kind of bring that together making them feel like a team %HESITATION helping them %HESITATION of all of it how Jenner if they could be how we were exploring problems exit or were there any organizational changes you made to like increase the teams visibility and execution I think the biggest one was probably %HESITATION that hires researcher that I mentioned you know because I just broadens what design means and what you would come to a design team for I think that was the biggest shift now what is the  what does a strong designer look like to insult after sitting across if you're sitting across the %HESITATION designer and they and they they wanna they wanna work for you what are you looking for in that meeting  %HESITATION well I think we look for products sense so the product thinking you know before you even get down to pixels like really kind of breaking down given to give a get a problem you know how do you go about and kind of solve that from a lot of plans because that's key to I think having the larger sort of impact is key to going from zero to one on something yeah %HESITATION to having a sort of conversations that you're gonna have with very bright product managers engineers etcetera so that's one I think  a great sense of craft in in really caring about the details is important but I think having a good balance between I'm solving a problem and then it when I'm solving animus solving extremely well sure I think I'm looking for %HESITATION some technical chops were heavy prototyping culture so that has to be a an ability to kind of adapt to that world for sure %HESITATION being to specialize can be  you know or just say Hey I just work in you know sketch all day that's not enough  that I think a %HESITATION self awareness is a big one which it which kind of gets back to kind of a more of a cultural peace but you know know where you are note know where you're going no where you're weak we're trying to build %HESITATION because you know if you're joining a team like this eat there we here %HESITATION my hope is that you're coming to develop right and that you can going come on a journey with us you're looking to actually get better and for that to actually be successful you have to be able to take feedback and and get going to kind of %HESITATION Justin adapt arms that be another  do you think there are some skills %HESITATION the designers seem to be overlooking today that might be costing them opportunities like this sure I think it's kind of goes back to the and see the world what were the things that you learn there is you learn how to pitch work yes right you know how to sell work that's like it's really critical to everything and that's certainly under leverage that something that every designer no matter what level %HESITATION is always trying to get better at it is like to come in and say this is why this idea is you know solves this problem you know and to paint context really quickly and and then to sell through an idea to all different types of stake holders at every level I think that's a huge one  what %HESITATION can designers who perhaps feel a little bit disempowered in their businesses out what can they do to increase their influence  question  I think that one understanding the customer is something that everyone an organization can do you should everyone doesn't necessarily and whoever gets closest to  the customer is in a better position to kind of shape direction right you know so  kind of comes in the product research side there are other ways of doing that other ways of gathering understanding about %HESITATION the customer because any business doesn't page and other customers is pretty screwed right and so there's usually some opportunities there I think yeah %HESITATION so that's one way I think that %HESITATION from a story telling his perspective you know how you frame up your work in present your work is is tremendously important %HESITATION to be able even demonstrate that you can think beyond just kind of feeling a feeling I order you know like you don't put yourself in place we just constantly a short order cook sort of thing actually say Hey I got some other things here it's like yes for this but I think the problem we're trying to solve this this so this is what I also did yeah right which is also something happens in in sees allies like you asked for this new thing but you know maybe what she is purple right now and and I think having that productivity and in which is rooted in a deeper understanding of the business problem yeah %HESITATION can help elevate that as I it's harder for designers in agencies because they tend to lack the business context of the companies of the working poor right so %HESITATION conversations tend to not come up it's almost always about the look and feel because that's %HESITATION that's the role agencies play in most in most partnerships anyway %HESITATION  okay so you brought up story telling about four times  it's clearly a theme given here is this my transition yeah I  %HESITATION what makes a good story and and and actually maybe more importantly when we use the word storytelling right some designer Senegalese over and they  send us a all god storytelling again right so what does that mean when you say storytelling are you talking about novella style like storytelling are you talking about  just keeping the attention of someone wait where where where do you what what a story telling it to me I think it every Sir has like an arc right you know there's there's some kind of set up and situation then there's like you know like a crisis right in this kind of some some sort of resolution right so %HESITATION and so sorry telling least likely presenting design like how you framing of the work how you can figuring your audience value wait what you're about to show them because that's almost like I guess them all and thought about this way was kind of a moment of crisis when you're actually show the work if you just get that right and you just you just show work they're not evaluated the value any web based on what they had for lunch right like so you need to kind of  bring that audience long so they want to come along that journey and then they're they're they're kind of configured I guess to evaluate the work in the way you want them to write and then getting to you in the resolution of course is that you get the sword feedback you wonder you get a decision made except right right so I think being good at that like how you setting things up you know and then how do you actually present the goods and and and you know making sure that the outcome is what you need %HESITATION so that's usually what I mean by storytelling in the context of designers bringing that into their skills that there are other types of storytelling like actually going back to some that the Nike work where we actually did do storyboarding things like that which are really useful for when you're solving large system problems or anywhere there's multiple kind of actors in the system that you need kind of figure out how to play out or or in that case  %HESITATION there's a host lifecycle like figure out like where it where it is this the service fit into someone's day and having using in just leveraging %HESITATION the language of like filmmaking I was a really useful tool but most of the story telling when I mean storytelling like in this context it's more about how %HESITATION work it's get shared isn't it are there any tools and resources or books that you read about story telling that can help people %HESITATION videos that you watched online mentors %HESITATION let's see %HESITATION actually %HESITATION friend James %HESITATION Buck house okay %HESITATION he's got a good medium post about this he's workin DreamWorks and does a great job %HESITATION like talking talking through story %HESITATION Scott McCloud's books on on actually on comics right that's a classic text that that %HESITATION gets reference that kind of what's the key to that you know I mean I I take the story telling piece of that away from that'll be two examples and then the last we created the ink let him look like that's just us essentially just get lost in them yes %HESITATION I was sad when it was over  you know that I can do it again %HESITATION I think %HESITATION yeah Pixar's actually at a company that we we we actually are inspired by in terms of their process right so %HESITATION yeah  thanks again to square space for

design platform power in the future of digital design to their understanding of the importance of collaboration there use my some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook capital one Netflix in every ND I work with remote teams all the time I found the keeping a healthy dialogue is really important without it building strong work relationships gets a lot harder and that leads to poor collaboration I've also found the prototypes are great way for me to show my full vision for design and this helps cut down a lot of back and forth  invision makes all this really easy you can rapidly prototype %HESITATION designs and collaborate across every stage of your project taking your ideas from concept to code it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes

a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision out dot com slash high resolution for three months free  so you joined Instagram about two years ago %HESITATION and one thing I find is the very best thing about this company's how design is always been an integral part from day one writing %HESITATION but there's always room for improvement so I'm really curious what you did during your first three months here  what you prioritize and know what's what's your signal to for sure when I came in there is a very small you know talented team designers in the product is I siders by like six people or so but they're all like really super talented hand and then %HESITATION the co founders of the companies %HESITATION Mike and Kevin are two people that are you know very craft oriented people right you know where the quality of of of work or close kind of everything in their lives they they tried to date like a lot of intentionality around it and like things to be done well right that that's something they value deeply  so coming in it was less of a challenge to figure out how to make design matter more and just think about okay we got the basics there you know how do you %HESITATION how do you extend that right %HESITATION a heavy not mess it up and then to you know how do you go deeper what other opportunities are open as a result %HESITATION so within the first three months and there was a lot of %HESITATION there is some areas that had to hire four X. at around there is %HESITATION we were working on our ads business and things like that so built out hold side of the team that wasn't there %HESITATION but there was a project that was %HESITATION listed under something that I would solve news listen before I actually got here which is interesting which was %HESITATION you know new app icon and right so that was a major undertaking that didn't that started we start talking about at least in that in that first  the first three months and so that was a new peace and that was %HESITATION missing opportunity again we're talking about this Brandon product piece right so you played it it was on while it wouldn't be a project I'd recommend anyone during the first year  it's it's it's a it it definitely played to some of  my strength %HESITATION into these blades allow me to take advantage of my experiences working here you know for big brands and and you know and then bring it to Instagram and earlier you spoke about brand and product is I like being really close together was that the state here already or was that something you brought I see I I don't think there was %HESITATION there is certainly some key brand assets of people he well like the app icon little lesser the cliff but one of the first things we did obviously is going to go through and look at %HESITATION do not it if things and it was like kind of a little place like it wasn't really like %HESITATION yeah a good through line through what made Instagram %HESITATION Brandon identity like kind of together right there there wasn't wasn't stuck together so that was a huge opportunity and you knew that we need to solve that so even as we even the main project was the app icon we always kind of tested against what would this be like you know on a T. shirt or in the world and doing things that we haven't done before right so it's always kind of figure out doesn't have the legs it needs to to solve the problems not just seen front of us now with that ones that we see down the line so  what is your relationship with Kevin Systrom is my bus again of us that we have a really great working relationship as I mentioned you know craft is really front and center for him in his life %HESITATION and so we've got a really good basis you know for for a good working relationship  and we took a shuttle over from place with that was %HESITATION I'm curious what is the relationship between Instagram design and face with this I I know you know I share the same it's the same one but yeah so you know  where we saw Instagram is part of his book overall but we we operate as our own on company we have kind of our own skin of sub culture yeah say %HESITATION but I I collaborate with the other heads of of design are at different parts of face looking so in that function looking at over %HESITATION %HESITATION what it takes to help design %HESITATION it within the organization you know looking after %HESITATION career paths for for designers including opportunities whether it's like learning developing opportunities or how we evaluate folks to make sure that they're they're growing in during their time here regardless of where they're working with in Facebook Inc %HESITATION we look at how we can help design can %HESITATION to Facebook can help %HESITATION design community at large right so what things can you do what our contributions we can make in the world as a result and then also it's a useful I find it is a there's some great colleagues there yeah and and so I find it really useful venue for me to work through some of these large scale problems right there's not %HESITATION it's not that many companies out there that can operate our scale and not just terms of the internal but the people that we serve in the world and so being able to %HESITATION have khaleesi can be openly share information with and %HESITATION take some best practices or just share learning so there's that advantage as well %HESITATION I want to talk about something a little bit contentious okay so Instagram just launched stories and I will say I love it I think it's great my tie network alliance around so this was a this was a big deal for me %HESITATION  can you take us into the room with you and Kevin where you guys first had the conversation and and and I want to because half the industry or I don't know it's half but a lot of people seem to think that  it's just blatant copying of Snapchat and the other half seem to think that it's a very natural evolution of of where Instagram should have gone would have gone anyway right %HESITATION so what was that first conversation with Kevin like what you guys right yeah that was definitely a lot more than just Kevin talking about because as you know what you're getting to is %HESITATION %HESITATION we start with problems right and so the problem that we're trying to solve it this was the overall quality bar that circle felt the pressure to post the best photo right on Instagram which everyone you know feels right and so we we want to loosen that up and we want to make you feel like you could share with everyone as often you want yeah you know %HESITATION and so that was that that was that not we were trying to crack yeah so we actually didn't start with the stories format anything we actually look at it from a lot of different angles into but really just focus on how do we allow you to feel comfortable sharing whatever you want to share with you and share %HESITATION we eventually landed on the format because it it did solve a lot of those problems but that's kind of the starting point Laker team you know you can't just like rafters new organ into you you know this this new %HESITATION to to this %HESITATION surface and an ecosystem and just expected to work that that almost always fails you have to really get into the details of how you make that %HESITATION integration happen %HESITATION and so there's a tremendous amount of work trying to get those details right in order for it to be successful and and the goal was for it to feel like something that always belong to their right in in that and %HESITATION yet you know if you weren't ready to use it you know you didn't have to %HESITATION so it was there in a project to let him all right so you guys built it use it internally yeah it's the night before you ship  okay come on tell me like there's there's gotta have been a moment where half the D. was like oh my god what are people going to think you know like well is yet so that's interesting is that %HESITATION at least for for us that we we did we already launched like the a new app icon things like that we would have done had a lot of that sort of energy right in and so by the time we were we're launching stories we had already kind of %HESITATION I think made people where that Hey instagrams changing right we're we're making some and I think by the time we got to stories I think that of course we didn't know how to receive but we worked on it enough to know that it was a good product yeah we felt we felt good about putting out there we just got about what happened with the lawn so I think there's a lot of confidence in in at least what we're putting out there adoption you know you just have to wait and see %HESITATION but we've if we feel great about where land so we spoke specifically about the stories feature but also within the past six to twelve months a lot of strange with Instagram yeah from the Rio Grande color yeah %HESITATION bringing back like the color within the up and bring in more actresses of the photos that's a lot of innovation in a very short time so I'm just curious looking from the outside like what change like what was the forcing function did you guys feel that you're trailing behind like your **** out I think that %HESITATION there was a couple things so I think the the company got to a place of maturity where we could do more than one thing at once right so there's that this is a fundamental like team growth peace process growth piece to be able to say okay now we can take on take on more there was a recognition that that we did need to involve like I said you know that the kind of quality piece was like a hindrance to our people phone company creating that's like something fundamental that we knew we needed to evolve and change  think and then making the commitment to change something as fundamental as the app icon gave us the conference is a okay well what else can we push on you know because in this in in the social space especially you have to all right you know I've been %HESITATION working %HESITATION the first company work that actually was a start up that did  social networking back in the late nineties right so that's number one role you know like you have to continue to evolve so there's a recognition that doesn't happen and then %HESITATION I think would allow us to do it well was that we picked the right problems to focus on me to find them really well and from a planning standpoint we made sure that we weren't taking on too much at once which I think I'm blocks a lot of it you know I think sometimes you tie too many things together you can't really execute on anything %HESITATION well necessarily or things get blocked behind each other is I think we did a pretty good job planning things out and you know and you want to launch stories there's a lot that could follow behind it yeah and we had the momentum to to to keep it going so you spoke a bit about %HESITATION your process for prioritizing these things that you watch spray %HESITATION in earlier you mentioned that you had reached a level of maturity to actually work on more than one thing %HESITATION Instagram is six hundred million users right and you know there there's a sentiment that at big organizations even slower you're right so it's interesting that you contraceptive that because of your size you were able to work and some things at one time so besides your process like what one of the things are you guys doing to get around a lot of the the hoops that many big organizations face when they try to move quickly yes I think %HESITATION you can never underestimate like kind of your planning improvisation process which again it's not it's one of those things that isn't like  no shiny and and fun but I think that's that those are the things that I'm blocked teams that to say okay during this where she declines like now go run right now %HESITATION and and I think that it's not to say that that's all it that's as we get bigger that's only can become more and more of a challenge right to do that well but that's why you also need %HESITATION you know strong kind of curatorial voice at the top saying we're going to invest here when I can do that right now except or to keep the team focus because you know sometimes you can get so big and you have you have you know a big very talented team that can build anything you there's a temptation to build everything sure right and so that's the that's the thing that we're constantly kind of pushing against his to make those decisions around what to focus on so you're  since you've been here you're basically the change agent like the is that what you feel like the product team show the button and I think I think that it's more about the phase that came in I think I can  finding was a timing is right  but and and I think that we are close and we we we we have the %HESITATION I think that %HESITATION you're miking cabin or are great you know great team and when your art like kind of so we're gonna coming that is founder let you know they can make those decisions right and they can be like this is where we're going and that and that that helps thing on block a lot of things sometimes if the company doesn't have its founder anymore it's that the way decisions are made a lot more political lot more bureaucratic and that's those things down and so we have that we're lucky that way Facebook's looking that way as well  well listen I I perfectly I'm fine with taking existing paradigms of building up  as long as the person building it continues to evolve it and have it on it right so tell us a little bit about  where or how do you think about where Instagram should go next me don't I'm gonna details if you don't want to but if you want to but if you want to please do no one's watching  I think we were very interested in in helping people express themselves right so yeah I think you start to see a cadence of us of releasing new kind of creative tools and and and and differentiating there we're really interested in not just the sharing peace but we feel like what's most important is that %HESITATION the connection that gets made yeah I know %HESITATION you between people right now and and and the the the the fact that if I share something with you didn't have to call the bar but the creates a moment between us or some sort of understanding with us like we're actually %HESITATION relationships are actually stronger as a result right that's what we're optimizing for so we want to give you a pallet you know to work with to just express what you're feeling any given moment yeah so we're focused on a lot of that and started to see some of that even products like live that are out there to give you that kind of real time %HESITATION kind of connection %HESITATION you know is starting to you kind of differentiate from like a standard you know stories product %HESITATION so yeah we're excited about that world  how do you spell your week  meetings so glad conversations etcetera %HESITATION so but I do try to structure the week we from the team perspective that we start the because the team in the week as a team even as we grow and so you start off on a Monday with more of a %HESITATION stand up where seventeen for people understand just a high level what's going on with people focused on if you're new to the team to get to know people %HESITATION etcetera and Fridays and the other part of the sandwich is like a  a large team credit which is this point is somewhere between Crittenden FY I where people can share work in progress get feedback from people that they don't work with sure day to day %HESITATION and it's a it's just a good venue for the whole team to kind of get in the room and this seems usually have crits throughout the week in me I spend a lot of my time either with people I support in in doing when once %HESITATION recruiting and things like that product reviews the whole exciting bunch of staff at the %HESITATION so we've %HESITATION we source some questions from our community okay and all our guests are going to answer these five questions okay so going to jump right into this thing all right %HESITATION so the first question is how do you explain the role of designed to people on Instagram and so I think it is design when it comes to design and die research yeah can help %HESITATION I nurse opportunities right and help drive wow what it is we we need to to work on yeah and then I think on the the product design side there's a dignified definition of how we're gonna go and solve a given problem right here there's a lot of collaboration with the product team the product management team on building out a strategy and and really getting sharper about how we're defining the problem %HESITATION but then I think the designers can and can help or really focused on the how and why and how we go about solving the problem  the second question is how is the design team structured and organized Instagram sure so %HESITATION the designers it's a kind of a general is pull designers they spend a lot of their time working environment like sketch doing layout peace or actually working a prototype %HESITATION environment like our Oregon used  video and so each designer is is usually dedicated to a particular pillar or or kind of product area you know to be it cleaning tools for people that are on you when you're creating content for Instagram like a stories whatever that what is it with the tools that we offer there and they're kind of dedicated to that right or on our business platform side helping businesses or Instagram as well this whole suite of of of tools that we offer there and they're focused on that so I'm usually there are there's a pool of designers dedicated to each of those areas in this kind of some pieces as well and is designed managers over each one of those areas research is is is similar as well focusing on particular pillars that you can get  no good collaboration good healthy collaboration between product engineering design research content strategy is another piece %HESITATION and so we we try to build little units that we are the designers that are building this is not one of the communications I just wanna follow one of the designers that are building or designing %HESITATION and prototyping the poor Instagram experience also doing boomerang and lay out and all the secondary experiences around Instagram or is that a completely different I mean the the the other apps yeah the other I had a lot of those apps into being spun out from the the core team so like a team that may be working on %HESITATION just tools that are that %HESITATION impact the main flow of creating content French cancer %HESITATION movement was example on that was also an example of something we said you know what maybe this is better to do separately %HESITATION and then find the linkages you know it'd to come off and the main app so it's more the own the domain and on it or the problem space yeah %HESITATION and they can kind of obsess about that %HESITATION okay so this next question is %HESITATION when you're the only designer and a company how do you can  Vince the business of the value of design he leave our  begin today  and then on the right where we're like you know if you're the only designer in the not building it up maybe you should think about that right yeah %HESITATION but it but in lieu of that because you might need a child %HESITATION  you know it exactly %HESITATION yeah I I think that you you should be well versed in the business problems right you know like so you can figure out how you can add as the designer because if you're the only designer you not just the designer you are are you right now and so I think that %HESITATION figuring out opportunities to help the business right and and so don't just come back to look I just lay out you know copying images or you know I just designed you why but like really get in there and and meet with the people that are thinking about the business and then that should allow you to find new opportunities to maybe add value in ways or in certain design into places where folks may not expected to add value for the next question is how can designers measure and present the results of their work people in their business picture an environment like this I think that on the whole measurement pieces just hard wired in you know you've got you know products %HESITATION part of management in their Exeter so I think that %HESITATION but it is advantages for designers to get really fall first %HESITATION you know in understanding and breaking down numbers and not kind of shying away from that right %HESITATION because you know a lot of the conversations around where products should go next maybe based off of data coming in and show you Billy ask more questions about that %HESITATION or  really be work in partnership with the analytics folks there and and that's another discipline that plugs into a design into a %HESITATION to a by product team %HESITATION and ideals and sometimes it's not just about measuring the output but it's also being inspired by what's in the data to I think that's one of the great things when when %HESITATION we we do ward %HESITATION quantitative research or you know be on to try to observe what are people actually doing on the platform in new products can spring and of that right so %HESITATION I think being well versed in understand the data in being able to ask no good questions and collaborate with people analyzing the data is what's most important so we can end with this one last final question all right go get them crime OB so as the function of design has continued to evolve and will continue to evolve what are some roles and methods that you think might emerge over the next five years roles innocent the five years interesting well I think you know it we we are you know there's some obvious ones these days where you know people are thinking from TV three right thinking about %HESITATION the leap that meat was made from something that's desktop and web based to to mobile now that seems to be emerging space and you've got %HESITATION I think that %HESITATION it's becoming more important if you're designing a service right there's lots of different touch points like where you know it maybe in someone's home isn't the different piece of hardware or you got in your ear or something like that so thinking about all those different touchpoints into like a different skill set you know think about that kind of life cycle %HESITATION actually think it be interesting to see how designers can help design algorithms right because I think that while it may look at machine learning things as a very  the scientific process I think when you talk to engineers %HESITATION you know that that there's a there's a bit of art and science to those things right now IT to getting them right and you know I could match maybe it's a five year thing but I can imagine a world where designers are designing algorithms writer %HESITATION so I think those are a couple areas top of mine well it's a good place to answer all right
