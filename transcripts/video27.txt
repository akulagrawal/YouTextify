Lucien monies body goes on and I'm Jared around we're speaking to twenty five masters of the design industry we're gonna learn from them every single week as we have been so far we hope you guys have been liking every episode who we have today we have Stephen gates Stephen is the global head of design for city bank is gonna tell us why design increase if he's actually blue collar profession how to design for such an old industry like banking and what it really takes to become a design leader we're gonna get to this episode give us a second right after this part a message  thanks for the support

purchase  Stephen thanks for joining us sure thanks for having me first question what's one thing about designed it's clear to you that you don't feel is quite other people  that's the first question is gonna be fun %HESITATION  I I think that the thing that I think about a lot of the one thing that I think it's clear lately that I think other struggle with is when you think about creative industries thing about designer stuff like that I honestly feel like we're in a time right now we have an opportunity to influence businesses to influence products in a way that I don't think creative the scene since like the industrial revolution I think the challenges that were blown it because I think that there's a little  just when even in the question you asked about when people think about our contribution industries design I'd look at a little bit differently because I think that for me  whether you're an agency where you're increasing at an in house team like me or something like that the contribution that companies once is creativity  because there isn't such an increased demand on how to they separate themselves how do they do things differently how they do things better and a lot of that's creativity and I think that's what they want is they want somebody who can come in and show them how do I have better ideas and then how do I get those ideas out the door in a way that people still care about you because that's the struggle is so many times it gets this kind of like a watered down neuter down sort of a thing so I look at and say look our our focus should be creativity our focus should be on business to move the needle to take advantage of the seat at the table that we've got that we haven't had in decades  the problem is we just focus on design for me creativity's problem solving design is then the visual expression of that solutions so design is almost a by product but I think we we hit this crossroads where we've had the opportunity that's been presented by the industry but then we also have social media which suddenly you look at the troubles you look at the Pinterest you look at things like that that you have created this like internet famous focus on looks  I would love to spend my time with no tech constraints with no budget constraints with no and just design stuff that's pretty yeah they we have to answer for more than just pretty and and I think that's the thing is that there are so many people to just do the design the don't understand the business because they don't understand things like that I think that's the place where you can have that real impact and I think people are just starting to understand that but I think is an end to  then we struggle because we don't actually have the leadership constructs in place for how do you teach people how to do that you mentioned %HESITATION I Ellison your podcast the crazy one podcast %HESITATION and you have an entire episode on creativity is a blue collar profession yes I found that fascinating %HESITATION I think that was the first time I heard it expressed that way can you talk a little bit about what you I mean if you've got an entire hour of it yeah yeah no I do I can I can give you the cliff notes version no I think yeah I mean I think as a reaction to this one for leadership and stuff like that and apparently because I have an allergy to free time I'd started the podcast and I think that one of the things for me was that I grew up in Pittsburgh during the collapse of the steel mills so I'd I really grew up around what were a lot of kind of like blue class working class people and as I'm going on in my career I had one distinct advantage of my dad was a crate of actors I've been a paid designer since I was twelve nice what that taught me or let the let me see was an industry from the time whatever it was like doing paystub teasing cutting ruby less than a whole bunch of stuff if you were after you'll to figure out what it is  I think that what it let me see is that  the idea the concept that ideas are light bald is bullshit like that's not we've all been conned into thinking that it's easy  and a lot of the times I look in trying to figure out okay like what are other industries what are other things I can use to explain what I mean and I think creativity is essentially no different than being an athlete if you talk about a football player they trying to the off season they work through the weight room they do a lot of this stuff to prepare for that moment of greatness to be on the field to catch the ball I think creativity is no different I think that you have to go out and treat it like it's a blue collar profession that it is work because two things one is the  add a labeled as inspiration it's not an idea it's it's identifying an area of opportunity to get you excited  you then have to work and grind through a huge amount of that work to figure out what's the what's the colonel what's the execution how do I get through all the bad to get to the good and again I think this is where a lot of that instant gratification kind of generation suffers with us because they just wanna do it once and be done  so I think there is that issue with it but I think there's also really treat like a blue collar profession because I think if you want to find great ideas if you'll find breakthrough ideas you have to find the opportunities and the moments in which those can live right because if you're an athlete you don't just show up on the field on game dance okay great now may be athletics right right no creative is no different than if you're working a particular industry you're working for a client is going out living that industry it's a living whatever that is so that you can say Hey look there's the consumers are going to work around their their something missing there that was harder than it should be to identify these areas of opportunity that I can then go back and put in the time against to be or have ideas there I think it's also just figuring out like I'd I'd go to chefs a lot I think it's an interesting parallel to the work that we do that I'd look to them for inspiration and I think that like one of the best chefs I ever talked with was the juror on a shelf behind your dreams of sushi and talked about like okay whatever young chefs come in how do you teach them how to be great how do you teach them and the the best explanation around this I ever heard he said like to cook great food you have to eating great food that's fair enough and I think design is the same I think you have to go out and consume whatever you're given medium is I think you have because you need a palette for you okay I found  opportunity I've had the idea how is it any good how do I know if it's gonna resonate with people on just a conceptual execution all levels of I'm not constantly working that palette of I'm not constant putting in that training but that's the problem is all that other stuff is the off season stuff it's thank lessons for opportunity that I don't know when it's going to show up it's not fun it's not like okay I'm gonna go make something I think that's the part of and that's why I talk about is because I think there's becomes such an emphasis was so many designers just on the making  making is gonna dad and your career there's a lot of people can make pretty pictures especially here in New York not hard to find people who can think people who can lead people interventions business unicorns  cool  yeah hi I was just as eating that up %HESITATION yeah that's awesome so no greater process is the same right %HESITATION but I imagine in your experience you come across many people straight across the seas and you probably identified some patterns amongst them that I tend to lead to good outcomes what are some of those things I think that a lot of it is one is teaching ever getting them to have the ability to externalize their process yeah too early on it's it's not the concept of fights the concept of we like that's one of the the simple things I do to evaluate team houses which one of those words that they use but how to wipe put whatever my idea is out to a group partially to have them help me write the best ideas I've ever had I did not have a loan everybody has a portfolio they did not created a long but it I so I think that's one thing is again how do I bring in the different perspectives you know to do that but also because I want a group of people the will do who do what I do which is to active  try to break my idea what are the weak spots what are the things that could be better what are the areas that weren't quite thought through because I think we just naturally fall in love with our ideas you had as a white piece of paper we put an ID on top of it there's a personal connection to that irrefutably so okay if I may be able to blinded to that how do I have this kind of advisor group they can come back and say okay look you need to think about this this and this and construct that away that it's not personal but I think there is the ability to externalize that I think that there is the willingness the hunt to fail to fail fast to figure out because I think so much of finding great ideas is finding a lot of really bad ones everybody has that process you start with what is the obvious place that we would start resenting that everybody would arrive then how do I start working out away from that how do I start to push out how do I start to connect those dots differently and I think it was right what talk about before we how are the people or they spot an area of opportunity to maybe other people didn't see I mean I'm I'm joke for years like I mean I've worked on automotive accounts their gas stations I'm banned from in like New York City and in Texas and other places because like I used I worked on Subaru for a long time and I used to go stand at a gas station and wait for like something a WRX to drive up so I go ask about their car you get a guided six foot for walking to the gas station  %HESITATION car people some people love it some people call the cops right like  everybody racks tool to differently but but that was the thing to me was like okay how do I put that idea out there how to like find empathy with it how do I figure out does it really work from I just talking to myself because there's an inherent understanding that I think which is the next thing that you have to have empathy and empathy is not that error  against that says %HESITATION like a you know I use this product for a little while on the consumer you're not like ninety plus percent of time you're not you need to go out you need to spend time with these people you because there's a difference between what people do and what they say so build that empathy with them and I think like those of the three big ones because it's those ways were how can I put it out there how can I get the strongest idea because I think the people who hold it tight who wanted to be presses you don't anybody to see if you want to treat it like it's a fragile little object the world is not going to treat it like a fragile object though the world is going to treat it as the reality it is that's why I was get very mad when like if somebody put a product out no %HESITATION we'll fix it to point out consumers understand what the hell to point %HESITATION as they understand the product it's in front of them and so I think you know those are those are just some of the things but again I think that's the challenge though is that every single person is different so yeah okay so you mentioned %HESITATION externalize process willingness to fail and the thing right I want to go back to externalizing processor %HESITATION we spoke about going out there and actually figuring out what are the opportunities and bring it back and especially show to skeptics or cynics this is the thing that's been coming up so basically put holes in your idea right %HESITATION but for designers listing what is that deliverable or what is that thing that you're putting in front of people because I imagine a lot of people are assuming it's a design and maybe it maybe it's not yeah and and again I think in a lot of times it can be a wide range of things I think it depends on where you are in the process I think that that's a lot of times in a row I work through the process on my work and in the first step but I'm often taking the first I'm taking the testing is a concern is just a conceptual test is to look for where the areas of opportunity when it's kind like where the edges and what point of my going to just simply put IT out there that's passed what can  Chris can stomach it's just gonna be somewhere they don't want I'm talking to myself like there's a lot of that sort of stuff so I think how do I figure out where those edges are and then I think that from there are a lot of times I keep it very deliberately low fidelity it's could be sketches it could just be written it could be it's anything that keeps it from feeling like a design like object because I think there's just a base human psychology that if it looks real people were treated as real you can put every F. P. O. disclaimer in like eighty seven point bright red blinking eat at Joe's Erro type they're still gonna go also is what the button looks like no so I think a lot of it is is starting there with them and bring them along but I think a lot of it for me is also been really teaching them what that process is that this is going to be a journey we're gonna go on together because again I think that that's one of the bigger challenges is how do I bring in my clients how do I take them on that journey with me because if it's just me kind of coming back and just showing them what it is they are really a part of the process and then it becomes much more like yes or no or things like that if I put them on the train if they go with me if they're invested in that nobody wants to jump off a moving train  there's just the base human psychology on the support when I'm a part of so I think that's a lot of it is like look you know because I'll start that by saying look if you want to I'm gonna hold you to your word if you want to be innovative if you want to do something that's truly different we have to understand that we don't know where we're going to end up when we start because I think that's one of the biggest challenges that I see with so many clients as they don't show up for the problem to be solved they show up with a solution to be vetted vastly different things I  thanks for us it's up to us to push back on that to not accept I'm just gonna go color in the lines but to be able to say okay look great on this journey and and that's gonna freak a lot of clients out because as creative as were all incredibly used to that uncertainty we're comfortable with being uncomfortable were used to going out we jump off the cliff assume that we will build our wings on the way down and we're not gonna Wylie coyote in the bottom whatever we get there  nobody else is used to that tech organizations are you so that clients are used to that it's why I see time and time again if you bring in design thinking bringing as a methodology that freaks out the entire company because they're used to go from a to B. and only would be as before they leave a  I think that's a lot of it is how do I get them used to and really like the same hallways coach my team on is like what I want in those moments when I come back with those insights when I come back with that stuff is I want them to know that I may be crazy but I'm not stupid  fast incredible difference crazy is the guy who will take the risk who will try to land and try to do something differentiated stupid is somebody who's just going to either keep inching closer just frivolously rescue and and kind of throw that away  that's the problem because the end of the day if they don't trust me if they don't have confidence in me because I think that's the biggest thing that I'm actually selling that process it's not one particular insight it's not what I'm selling is that they have to trust me if have confidence in me because if any of the work that I think is good goes out the door that has to be there if it's not not it's gonna CLA today  I'd like to go back to failure per second I still think that plenty of people playing designers the instinct is  you want to get it right the first time you're gonna do your best to get it right the first time but I'm not sure %HESITATION  I I've always struggled with  many people saying well you want to fill quickly anyone a bell as many times as possible is it that every time you fail it leads to the inevitability of finding something that works or is it is it by failing you humble yourself by humbling yourself you you you empathize a little bit better what I mean like I think that this thing for me is  there there's kind of an internal and external part of the question right I think from the outside from my clients and things like that I want to bring them along on the journey but that doesn't mean that I necessarily want them to see all of what goes on sure like there's a friend of mine is desired apple I thought of the best description I ever heard he always said look like as an organization what I want is I wanna be a dock on a pond you see it from above you just see that I kind of like smoothly gliding along underneath the water thrashing kicking it's complete mass but that's what I want is I want the reality versus perception I know I think that is the failure is just understanding how or why break the idea what really works and what doesn't and it's not being precious about that I think that you know like I have that kind of thing and whether you're coaching your team you're working on creativity like the first time it happens it's a mistake if you don't learn something from it then it truly is a failure because failing that does not make you a failure and I think that's where people get tripped up because failing it is part of that process is finding out what doesn't work it should be if I go too far I'm gonna again go past what people can stomach or they can do or they wanna be apart over there just not ready for inside to dial it back but as I said just because I'm feeling doesn't mean I've I'm a failure but that that's a part of it for me is okay if I'm not feeling if I'm not having problems of stuff isn't working I'm playing it too safe so the idea is you want to fail not for the sake of  and you want to learn from it what I think you have to because I think like the one thing I have a very big allergy to is like if someone comes in my office and goes over to design this is gonna be our version of insert brand names experience  right leg cover band never change the world right like I do for all we're gonna do is just go through and copy what somebody else did  yes it's safe yes I understand why you would do that no competitive differentiation no brand left no revenue increase no so again like if you're gonna do that he's going to be a future war then let's stop all the conversations about being innovative so I think that's part of it for me is is talking closing with the coaching clients about which one is it a guy one time had a client told me that they wanted a proven innovative idea  a proven to help me I was like that's it for a second right because it literally it was like you can make some rain and stuff but I think that's the thing is is which one is it because if you want to make sure that you're gonna hit this particular mark we can do a lot of testing we can do a lot of those things we can know within a reasonable amount of certainty  but that's the challenges again we're not going to know where would end up in and we need to find out what was what worked what was too far in and to be able to do that so I think that it but I think that's the stigma with it is like %HESITATION no engine work how do I handle that they're gonna think we don't know we're doing now set up in the beginning and saying look we're going to go get it wrong a lot spectacularly and that's what we want what is innovation then how do you describe it to not necessarily your team to the  the managing up I think for me I did you know it it's a ten it's a tough one right because I think you can take a lot of different forms for me innovation in a lot of cases is solving a problem filling a need and not copying while you do it  and I think but it comes in a lot of forms sometimes it can be big and spectacular I think you know the work that it started when we said okay look the key cards been around for forty years we're gonna go out and completely rethink that because we feel like that that's a moment that could be much easier that we look at that and said okay you know we went back and looked to the consumer and said what are those point of friction I've been on our I've been on a flight for sixteen hours I get off I don't wanna stand at the desk I just wanna go right to my room I have something that they will be able to let me do that I consul you either de magnetized or forget the key card so there's a need there then that that hasn't been Matt so let's go out unless trying to figure out how to fix that that's big that's spectacular press worthy keno where the all that stuff I mean you can be much smaller but but that's the thing to me is like can we look at that and say that this is actually different better it meets a need in a way that it hasn't been done before and I think good but the challenge to that is how do I do it in a way that it actually gets out the door in a form that people still care about because I think so much of innovation people use that word like to know what the hell that means isn't there times companies once I own a release a screen shot a press release about something we might do Sunday not innovative right right press where the not in not innovative but I think that's the thing is it's only people have gotten caught up in that buzz word let's be agile it's the innovative let's be what do you know that means like and then I'll ask the clients will Gluck tell me what what do you think that means that I had I mean I had a fascinating process were whenever I went between start I went to city I would sit down and I so understood that the thing that I needed was leadership that could trusts yeah and even if they couldn't define innovation they could trust that other people could and you'd find some leaders who cut  founder CEO of a huge company and I sat down I said great you know I'm gonna need your support can you define innovation for me he said you know what I really would love it if we could like update the point of sale systems in our stores  thanks for your time gotta go this has been great %HESITATION out right because that's the thing is it that's not innovation right but that's the thing to me it in I think that for me innovation is also for the fact that it's the willingness to fail because I I think you only find innovation if you're willing to put it out there and know that it's not going to be the huge home run like that was the thing you know that was the ship that we made we found success and star would we said okay look stop doing these huge your long projects were gonna come up we're gonna do an MVP of kilo sort of put into hotels one was here in in Harlem the other one not surprisingly was in Cupertino  and those were the two that I went to ten then I went to a hundred and fifty but it was like look let's do it let's scale let's figure out that if there are five people in an elevator that can become problematic because there's a key reader in there that you have to use it has to work in the gym in the pool it has to like there's a whole host of these other use cases we don't think about but let's start to do that let's fail along the way let's do it in a way that we're feeling smart we're not failing at scale  how do you define diversion and convergent thinking and what do you think it's so critical to our designers create a process I think I mean the thing that I would say is a divergent converts a thinking really comes out of design thinking which really is how do we just give shape to creativity because I think the reason why it's so critical of the reason why understanding it is so critical is because in most cases I interview a lot of designers and they come in and they sit down I'll ask them and also can look tell me how you have an idea  tons of blank stares  right I'm like no like what is what do you do whatever goes right what do you do when it goes wrong and I think most of them don't have the self awareness or don't understand how to use some of your creativity on demand because so much of growth in our industry is the ability to do that if I want to be ahead of design if I want to do things like that I've developed that ability to get feedback on the spot  but I think you know the divergent convergent thinking is just really again this goes back to a blue collar profession kind of question before that it's going through and say okay look I'm gonna have a ton of ideas identify a lot of areas of opportunity I want to diverge and I just want to go for scale how many ideas how many opportunities can I go for and then I want to convert Jonah bring it back together I want to edit it back down but it's not just doing that cycle once it's doing it again and again and again try to try to break the ideas weed out the weak ones find where there are overlaps do that sort of a process to be able to do that but I think again a lot of people you'll see him do it once and either they fall in love with the first idea they have warfare multiple ideas they fall in love with those and so there's a big jump initially but then after that they just kind of is pushing the pieces around much much smaller criminal change after that but it's in sensing okay look we need to make that leap of that size again let's do it like make it just as big push it just as far and it just it starts to kind of weed itself down as it goes with the weaker ideas will start to fall out the stronger ones will start to rise will start to Polish those and it gets that kind of sine wave that starts really big and starts to kind of trail off to a fine point but that's why I think it's so important for me is like I said  I think so much of creativity in the industry as well  somebody's eyes just happenstance  and so I think you know that's that's the challenge ET for leadership perspective on coaching perspective I think that's why it's so important to to understand concepts like that says it's giving is also giving younger less experienced designers a framework to think %HESITATION %HESITATION yeah right that I would I would argue even bigger than that because I think is when we go back we talk about it if if our charges bring creativity and what company  a big part of it is the fact that like if my product is just design I can put out a visual artifact I can do in a certain amount of time especially for an internal team I've done a fantastic job of making my team a commodity  because of the fact that all I can do is deliver on a deadline if my product is then creativity even a shift happens not all one in perception because my group instead of now being looked at as a commodity is just a lot of this will come to light with a big because like %HESITATION were service organizations  that we like it's why won't even go talk to like in house design team conferences because like I want to hear people whine about like over service or in the now what you're not but I think that's the thing is if it's about creativity then of my team is now in power to be leaders right because we've gone from being a commodity to being kind of the surepos we're gonna teach any group how to be creative and I think that shift is huge but then also because of the fact that now my team is become a critical assets you would have better ideas you want to do better things like that you need to create a team involved with it because that's again that's there's the perception from if the delivery is just design then I'm viewed as a commodity why do I need to be a part of a a brainstorm if my product is creativity we absolutely have to be a part of that brainstorm and people  one is to be there so yeah I think that's that shift in kind of what's the liberal how do you position at what's your products to your to get you to that I want to talk a little bit about how you lead people %HESITATION but I want to start with  do you feel a sense of responsibility over your people's happiness people that report to you  it's a tough question I I think yes and now I think I I feel responsible for it in the moments when I let them down  because I again I think you know if I'm the one that's leading the way if I'm setting the tone if I'm the one that that's kind of the mapping that out yeah the moments when I stumble the moments when I let them down I had one of these moments yesterday where I completely west on something and the team is to be a recognition a shot of it crushes me right because I know what effects them they didn't they weren't lifted up the way that they should that being said  I I can't disclose all of it back to like do you know your creative process do you know how to have an idea the other question often as great as in an interview which I think throws all of them for complete loop is do you know how to be happy  again a lot of stairs because I think that most people and especially critters because I think by our very nature we look at things and figure out how do we question how do we feel the connect the dots differently like how do we figure out what's wrong with it it's a hard switch to turn off it's hard to kind of say okay I'm not gonna be that way anymore because creative doesn't have an off switch I'd I don't like you know go home and I know okay not not I don't see things that way anymore  that's the hard part is because you know do you actually know how to have a do you know what you need for a couple reasons I think one is because the concept of what you're gonna need to be happy changes over the ark your career by  just the fundamental nature of the fact that what brings you into any industry where you create designer chef welder whatever like the longer you do it the inherently the further you get away from doing it I started twelve years old as a designer I have to fight now to be the guy they can't leave the find the time to walk into a like a room and sketch on a white board to do on my iPad or because just responsibilities are different  because now I have other people who do that I have to give them the space to be able to do that so like my concept of happiness being that kid a twelve to mount scenes multiple times but the reason why I think that's important the reason why I ask about it is because I think that too many designers look to leadership and say you're responsible for my process you're responsible for keeping me happy I I'd take issue with that because I think if you don't know where your career is going if you don't know what you need to be happy there I can't be the one that's going to give it to you it's an unrealistic expectation to put on me right because the hardest person for me to coach whenever I sit down I see where do you want to where you wanna go on your career what you need to be happy I don't know you need to tell me right I I'm I'm not you I can guess but I'm probably gonna get it wrong more than to get it right which means you're gonna get frustrated you're gonna leave before we can figure that out also this because I want people who at least can question that and can start to be on the road to that because those are the people that want to improve I don't wanna hire people that are destined to stay in the same spot I'm hiring them for I want them to have a vision and drive in growing but I think that's the part of it but I think the other part of why I ask is because I think having ideas has an emotional component to it but I think most people do not talk about because there's just there's a base human psychology that whenever you're happier more creative  but if you %HESITATION and it's  again I'll turn to sports psychology if you talk about like a baseball header if they're really in the zone hitting that baseball is like a basketball whenever they're really struggling they're in a bad head spaces like in a grain of rice I don't think it was much different so people don't know what they need to be happy and they put themselves in a bad head space their creativity drops the the the quality of their ideas drop and you know then it's a lot of time to go in and figure out how I kind of drag them back out of that and be able to do that and again I think it's just because it's just it's a hard space to go into  yeah because again if it starts to bring in you know things from their personal lives like there there's a lot of other stuff they can go into that but also just for the fact that I I I truly believe that I think that the best rate as I know also realize the fact that you don't get everything you need to be happy creatively just from your job are great I would like for me that stayed best job best moment seventy eight eighty percent  I think it's why do the podcasts why speakers why right like there's a certain part of like I just I need a different gear it's honestly it's why I cook every night because it just you know I'm working at a two hundred year old bank at that scale I would like to start and finish something and make somebody happy in the span of an hour and a half  in in so again I think you like but I recognize that in me that you know that that simple act of completing something creative does a huge amount forming  earlier you said that you with on on %HESITATION the dog on on your team get a recognized for something %HESITATION how often do you use make sure that your team gets recognized when you speak to the executives when you're when you're directing people above you %HESITATION how often you put your team in front of them and what do you watch as much as I can because it before a lot of reasons I think one is just for the fact that again for my team to be successful  I cannot have a team that is sitting around just waiting for me to be the one that takes the action for me to be the one with the idea for me to be the one that doesn't like every single person has to be empowered to be part of the solution right because I think that's the trap as if you're kind of like again %HESITATION culture that's up to leadership in my current it's up to them it's not and so I think you know that my part of it for me is is to put them in in those positions as often as possible I like to promote from within I like because again as we go back to the fact that I am not the one that had the idea alone I didn't do the work alone it's fascism boring for me to stand up there and say you know okay yes on the one you sure they're the meetings where they just want certain people of a certain title to be in there and yes I want to present but no I mean most of the time whatever they're dealing with my peers you know the the whatever it is the designer that's for two years down for me that's the one that's presenting to the person who's my peer because it's just you have to have that dialogue because again there has to be that trust and so the and also just because of the base fact that if they have an idea and if I have a question I want them to be able to ask it not that there's a greater director has a group project %HESITATION asked me who then goes Astor pier that telephones all the way back down like we we need to be able to have that kind of flow to things so that gives them a self as a self pride aspect the sense of responsibility over the work allows them to grow okay notation and ownership any because I think that's the part is like you know for the last ten years I've come to companies and said okay look we need to turn teams around  that's the part of it is like the moment when it happens is when that team starts to believe whatever they go from this from stopping a commodity to being the critical asset whenever they believe but a lot of that has to be you have to walk your talk you have to put him in that spot they have to see change because  many organizations had too many other people who walked in and said the right thing and couldn't deliver  thanks again to square space for

%HESITATION I I was just sitting here is blown away but I I'm really curious how critical you think communication skills is or are too it is %HESITATION yeah I know I think  you know me free is interesting thing well I guess that I I grew up in an ad agency I grew up you know learning typography on a seven hour pound letter press my parents basement and I think you know when you start working agency I think one of the things I started to realize was that even if I was a really good designers only gonna take me so far that at a certain point that the better job this were really dependent on your ability to present ideas to sell ideas to communicate with people to lead people in the towns that I had was it honestly all the way up until probably even I left college I couldn't speak in front of more than four people without being  a fight I mean I just I couldn't do it and it was one of those things where I think you'll from my current kind of step back and look at myself and said okay that can't continue and so I started to do little things like I would just be on my senior SRT of tourism and to cut my college just to be able to start to get in front of people here on how to do routine how do you make them laugh how do you do stuff like that  but you know the way that I use them with things I got incredibly cerebral with that  I started to go out and talk to like sports agents and venture capitalists I started to study with like poker players who can start to look at physical tells to be able to study things like that I started talking like police officers and %HESITATION interrogators from seal team six the so like I mean you know when you see these people I don't know I do because part of it was like okay I can start to communicate and I start to get better at it  because I'm six foot four I can whisper in a hurricane like I just I don't have the projection problem that some people have but then I started to do more new business well the thing whenever you start to do new businesses I'm now pitching I'm selling to a cold room after walking and realize that the loud mouth guy in the front isn't the decision makers the quiet guy in the back and that he's the one I really need to sell to right to read that room in an instant figure out how to why adapt what it is that I'm saying so I think a lot of Israel was just wanting to start to study this the start to study how to why communicate better how to more effectively like I want talk comedians you what but I've started talking to all these people I took like mine classes at all kinds of crazy stuff because it for me was just like look at it it's not an option for me to be able to do this but I think that I then started to realize that it wasn't the knowledge was power it was that sharing was power and so that if I start to be able to share in my team and my company it because it also started to then realize that %HESITATION cable companies want people they want to hire people that other people have heard of they want that like Gee whiz factor so for me to be able to do that I need to build my brand and so then I need to start doing public speaking and so now it's like they have been talking for like ten thousand or more people in so if it's a long way from a kid in college you can speak in front of but I think that was the part of it was you know my ability to deliver feedback  X. quickly so saintly my ability to to sell to really pitch to sway hearts and minds of my own team to my clients that's just like the bedrock of of what it is and it's to the point where they actually teach about a three hour class on presentation skills to all of my team and we practice it regularly because I think most creative have no idea how to do it and I think most of them present which is a massive massive mistake you're not presenting yourself like it's a very different mindset as a very different way of approaching what you're doing like if you have an excel spreadsheet you present it creative is subjective you sell it what does that three hour class look like like when you're teaching them the three a class it is it is a whole range of things I think a lot of it is is one is understanding just like your creative process just like your leadership process your presentation style is unique to you what is going to make each of you nervous what's gonna make each of you confident is gonna be different for me like I'm the guy who I need to sacrifice accuracy for storytelling I I said if I read off a script I saw the public access commercial I'm horrible like so it you know I realize that you know very bare slides few things pay attention to me listen when I have to say give me the ability that we've ever couple bullet points but I can riff on that so I can tell an engaging story and that my flow the way that I speak the cadence of my voice is has a much more conviction to it then again if I'm reading something so there's a lot of that sort of stuff %HESITATION just getting to understand who you are of kind of looking at what are just like the base personas around you know are you an educator are you somebody who's an entertainer you somebody's gonna do can be inspirational as you guys you present you generally start with one of those but as you get better how do you combine the three of them together to then just the basics of how do you actually  give a presentation like how do you how do you use bills how do I tell a story and literally go back and use just like the classical Greek mythology arc of you know we started a problem we went away we didn't want to do it like that hero's journey use that map that back to a presentation again to bring the Klein along to bring them into that all kinds of crazy stuff about even again when you talk about you know the guys from seal team six are from the police officers up had even manipulate physical space because there's a base human psychology that says if I'm inside of four feet from you I'm inside a personal space so if I was standing next to a close you start to feel uncomfortable if I'm beyond twelve feet from you I'm getting what's gonna call disconnected space which means were far enough apart that you feel like you can tune out without any consequence so fun to be in a board room that was as a twenty four foot long tables stand in the middle but it also means that I somebody that's been a problem in a meeting go stand next to them to use that physical proximity to control them tons of like these nuances of how to get them to just understand the base mechanics of just how do you control room how do you tell a story about how do you do it your way  I'm sure any designer and want to sit in this three hour class but we don't have the time and no one no one can access it right %HESITATION but what why would I mean what I will I will I will  going to say I did during their there three episodes of my podcast or go over this in great detail but for here today I think the thing is is how do you start to develop just like with your creative process we talk about self awareness your presentation styles exactly the same how do you start to recognize what did I do in a presentation went well what did I do and it didn't go well and the biggest way to do that is to record yourself because the thing that I was equated to is like for me  he I hear my voice on my podcaster here on the voice mail and I think for as long as I've been alive I've heard my voice in my head twenty four hours a day for every day I've been alive I can not sound like that much of the tool  but see that's the problem is the way rattles around my head and comes out is very different public speaking or just presenting isn't that different because the problem is that whenever I'm speaking out my brain is queuing up the next day I'm gonna say it sends it out of my mouth my mouth is talking in my brain is on the next sentence so this is where a lot of nervous ticks command this is where a lot of different things happened where the ohms this so that %HESITATION that does little text were people who aren't comfortable with silence start to develop that but that is also just the inherent problem of that happens because since my brain my mouth her to different places I'm not actually aware of how well I'm doing whatever I talk so what I make people do is to go through do a dry run of the presentation everybody has an I phone propped up somewhere have a boyfriend girlfriend goldfish dog hold it whatever it is recorded due to presentation stop and say how do I think I did Matt axle that I was great the flow was great I was funny it was awesome go back and watch it it's gonna be hearing your voice on that podcast from that voice mail they're gonna be text that you didn't know you had there's gonna be the cadence really wasn't that smooth you're not gonna be quite as eloquent because again I'm glossing over in my head because it sounds great and feels great in my head weight comes out of my mouth to be totally different  you have I think a lot of people have had the experience of working agency side and client side yeah %HESITATION this is something we actually explore with Scott Belsky as well but I'd like to ask you what are some of the differences between  freelancers  agency designers client side designers where they stand in contrast with each other then what can we learn from each other well yeah I know and I think I mean what we'll start with kind of agents and clients that is I think those are kind of the the the easiest to kind of against each other at the agency I think you know the thing that you learn is that creative is the heart of the house you know that they can that is the engine that drives that machine client side that's not the case we where I went to a star would you go to city where about putting heads in beds were about twenty dollars in bank accounts right like that and that's just the base part of what it is that we do so just the relationship to the business is very different but I think that you know that on the agency side you know that the challenge there is the fact that no matter what you do your disconnected from the actual business so I think with that you can learn on that side is the fact that treat it like you're actually part of that company invest in it invest in learning that business in in in generally understanding and not understanding it from like or stand the other side of the wall but just bend the times you can have the ideas and insights to general understand what that is but at the same time leverage the external perspective because of the fact that you've come in from the outside it does give you difference you want it I think you can be overly blinded by that because you're like all were new work some stuff you're right that that is an inside the room thought about some stuff we did think about it and we it's a bad idea I think on the client side it very much becomes about how do I preserve that agency spirits because the problems on the client side is the fact that whatever minute agency I'm working on an account there is an inherent threat that if I screwed up and getting fired it keeps the knife sharpened creates a hunger and a drive and just I did a willingness to get stuff done whenever you're on the client side you don't have that I personally maybe  I got fired but it's just it's a very different lesion since I think the the possibility for complacency is much much higher in so how do I keep that agency mentality but basically becoming internally to see with a client who just can't fire me but I think you know both sides have the the pros and cons go do that because whenever I'm on the client side I I don't have that you know several degrees of separation I'm on the inside I should be able to leverage that and I should be able to win every date of the week and twice on Sunday because I'm that much closer to it  I think you know me so there there's a push and pull between that for for craziness just understanding how do we do that freelancers then I think you know it it it occupies interesting space because I I always look at it  some people are freelancers because they should be some people are freelancers because of circumstance I think that they should be either because they are really good at just being the independent contractor the person who comes in with a very specific skill set the command there's something they can execute incredibly well and they can come in and and you value them for that and you bring them in and and you do that and then you kind of move on I think with the other one though is you know a lot of times it's a freelancer who somebody who either doesn't understand the process does not stand a creativity there is something that prevents them from messing with the team and so instead of I mean quite honestly turning and kind of facing what that is it's easier to just kind of keep bouncing around we can actually do so I see what you're saying but if you're a freelancer if you still owe mesh well with the team can actually do your job can you actually do the work of a designer well I I I think I think it's a big challenge right I think it depends on the discount on the size of the client because I think if it's if it's a big team that that does value the week and you're going to struggle and I and again I think that's why you see some people who go off in the  they do their own thing they they decide they want to work with small clients there's nothing wrong with that but it's just at scale big agencies big companies things like that when you need to be a part of it the demon the rock star is like the thing that I don't need right because I can't have somebody who thinks that they're above are better than the team  personally because I think if you does all the organization the right way and that there is that we're actually trying to break ideas they will reject the the rock star who doesn't want to externalize their process who doesn't want to so they already like the organism all kind of spit it out  and and and I think that there's a challenge for that but you know I think that's just  creativity is a team sport letters and it's hard to get around that I think is the same way it's it's a blue collar profession it's a team sport and you need other people to get better and it doesn't mean you can't do it on your own but I think but there is there's a shelf life to it and aposs certain point where you know I've seen too many people who go that road who are than five or ten years down the road really pissed off and frustrated about why is why am I not advancing past this position this role this skill set this whatever it is and that's the thing is because past a certain point it's about the we  you are the head of design at Citi bank Citibank is a really really old institution Ryan %HESITATION I'm really curious what were some of the conversations you had with executives when you're deciding to actually come into this company yeah so disturbed just because I'm I'm the head of design for the global consumer bank %HESITATION so obviously if you see the city branch or something like that that falls to me and I think I mean it was it was a fascinating conversation but the one thing that I I I have to say is that I do think there are a lot of industries just get a bad rap I think you you some of them you know banking had its challenges so if it's not  that's not understandable but I think is is you look at the role the design plays in a lot of organizations today me like some of point out to me the other day like Microsoft doesn't have a had a design so I think that it's just you know it it's more than just banking that has a challenge but I think you know the the thing that I look for it was the thing that I look for and agencies ad companies was a star rises city or something like that it was getting back to what I said before about leadership I need leadership that's willing to trust I need will leadership is willing to take a rest I need leadership quite bluntly it's going to put their money where their mouth is because I think the one thing that I've learned in pride the biggest reason why I left the agency what was I got too tired of working for too many clients who again were all about innovation rolled up change in ads on all that stuff right up until the moment where it meant that I was gonna ask them to do something different  and then all of a sudden they lost the force of that conviction of that sentence and things like that but I think that's the thing for me is like where are the leaders who are willing to back that up and I think whatever I went into city and I have that discussion I'll be honest I I didn't I didn't enter the job market I was talking to agencies and in house companies and consults his everything else I I banks wasn't at the top of that list but I think that was an incredibly arrogant and naive perspective on my part because at the end of the day whenever you go in and they say looking over two hundred four year old institution and we feel like design is gonna be one of the big difference here is for us going forward and that there is a massive appetite for it but we need somebody who can help solve and deliver it the opportunity to affect the way that people relate with our money but you're talking about yeah she wanted to put a dent in the universe government health care banking apple Facebook alike in there is there a few of those you can do it west but I think that  for me that that was the thing was as I sat down and thought about as I thought about the opportunity to come in and be able to do that and to have the executive support behind that because the other part that I learned is if you wanna come in changing organization one it's not quick  it takes time and it takes patience both of which are usually starts supply but I think that it's one of those things though that I need people who will stick with me on that but we're going to back me on that who are gonna you know be able to to really do that because just organizationally what I'm kind of what I find happens is you you come in you get the buy in from the design team they are desperate for somebody who's gonna come in and to lead them out of being a commodity into being a critical asset you get the buy in from the executives who are then really all about like yes we can see positionally this is what we need the problem is all the tears in the middle it's everybody has built up a little fiefdoms little kingdoms their way of doing things their process there but in color right like the website that's my we've tested at orange is better than blue whatever  but I think that's the problem is B. but by doing it that way and by getting that sort of buying what I know is like okay whenever I get into that middle layer and I need to start affecting change nice well we've done this a long time we study research I've got I've got this like to my boss and they're mostly to their boss interest like their boss like no dude on each of the top Mike what's great because I think that there is by and to do that because you know that the grass roots thing is harder but I think that was that was what drew me to it was I I found a sea on the global consumer bank I found leadership that really wanted to do that that whenever I went and said look these are some of my ideas that I have and I presented some of those to them  that they didn't get scared they didn't  make it smaller this wasn't the point of sale system thing because I think that's the thing I found is like you know what do the words we did at Starwood  it was only possible because we had a CEO who profoundly believe in what we were doing and who trusted us to go do it I mean there are times we work on those projects with apple there were two people the company they knew what we were doing was like I had it is on the ceiling that was yet and he to take a huge amount of heat for why is had a design would disappear for like months at a time but he had face to be able to do that and and the thing was for me like if you have leadership that does that if you want to be that leader if you want to expire to do that man there was no way I was going to go out and be and that sort of a contest to put work out there you know because those things are like the hunger games I wasn't coming in second right because I I was going to actually make sure that you mean what I'd earned the trust to get the opportunity I was not gonna let it down what was your plan of attack for grounding the design team in your first three to six months sitting a lot of it for me is on is incredibly unsexy is it can be as process because I think that really is just a gate way of looking at how do we do things what is our creative process what is the way that we do stuff because I think so many times if you start there and just fix the basics big changes can come in I think so that was my thing was just to go in and spend the first sixty seventy five days of my mouth shut only go in I wanna sit down I just wanna see what it is they're doing and I and I saw an organization that largely had really was more of that commodity they were just going in and somebody would say Hey this is what we want they would go do it and pass it back single kind of design and say Hey tell me what's wrong with it and I just said look this isn't over doing anymore you know we're we're actually gonna go through instead of just presenting one  things were presenting three were made to make a conversation instead of taking what they want as the idea in the beginning we actually gonna say okay look what's actually the problem that we want to solve and I'm in a lot of that to be honest was was a creation of their own making because since they had become a service organization the product people the the the business to clients it's constant will look like they are really kind of showing up with the thinking so we probably need to provide it to them is a very understandable relationship but for us we would go through just change that paradigm and this amazing thing happened the exact same people who were the ones with like all their that creative we spray good agencies suddenly we're the ones it's like wow that that this is the work we've been waiting FOR wow that would this is really smart wow this is really great but I think a lot of it was is going in and looking at how do we do that but I think also for me it is being incredibly almost brutally clear about what the expectations are for that because I think the other thing that you're gonna find is if you want to bring that change it's not easy there are days it is incredibly rough  but what you need to do is you need to have the strength to be stronger than the excuses and I think that when you know whenever we set with that process I sat down with the team and said okay look like this is the way forward this is the things we need to do and honestly guys one of two things is about to happen either about to start making these changes in the team's gonna get to a good place or we're gonna start making excuses  if we start making more excuses that we make change I'm going to start changing things until that stops  because again I I'm not going to lose the people who are bought and I'm not going to lose the people that are the producers and at some point in that moment there are some people who probably don't want to sign up for  that and that's fine  it's it's a bit of a warning shot of like great you you probably need to go ahead and move on because what this team is gonna be on those expectations is gonna be different what's a warning shoppers also permission no absolutely and and that's and that's why I do it is because I think for those who want to rise those who want to buy in the eighties permission to own it to run with it and with my complete blessing for those who just wanna make excuses and sit on the sidelines and be the spectators it has permission to go right  well listen in this next segment we reached out to our community and we asked them to tell us what they want to know most about and we have a few questions for you okay so the first question is how do you explain the role of designed to people at Citi bank  yeah I think  it's a little bit of going back to where we started right I think that it's not just designed the our role is to be %HESITATION to come in and to be able to help teach organization how to be creative I think it one of the first things the one through the door was partnering with audio and saying okay looking out because for me we need to be using design thinking mainly because there is no greater what I think is also like a Trojan horse for change from the design thinking because if I go out and I just say okay look where to do things differently now so you get to your processing is my process if I say Hey instead  legal compliance business products were you are that that had free okay historically credit has been an apartment no not creative is is is what we all are and I can bring you in on this design thinking process and we're also only a part of it and and we're doing things like that that is incredibly powerful it teaches other people that it's okay to take that risk it teaches them and as we talk about the  four eight it is it is the permission right because the for it takes that one guy to run up the hill yeah go get shot don't get killed get shot but but to do that and then it's like brave are like everybody come streaming over because they know it's safe but it's teaching them that it's okay to do that but it's okay because I just think so many people look at kids yeah are you pain are you spider man are you welding they say yes to everything they're open creed of channels I think the society education so much that trains and out of us but I think you know the it's also the ability to bring them in and because you guys gonna be so you create a little yeah you designer nope okay so let's let's just focus on the creative part then shall we so I think that's really what it's grounding it in and I think it it really is saying okay looking %HESITATION creativity is gonna be our stock in trade and this was before it empowers the team it puts us in a very different position have a very different conversation and it it makes our product about our thinking and not just about %HESITATION executions  how is the design team organized a city bank so that the way that the design team is done as it were actually so the the golden serving as basically broken into three parts there is city fintech which is basically a hundred person start up it will start a little bit a little bit over a year ago that's kind of like the the tip of the spear for the change we have the the core part of the business which is the business and it really had existed and this is you know that the apps the websites things like that and then we have innovation labs and those are really looking at where do we want to go how do we throw ideas and concepts out there that we can test and so the design team is the only one that cuts across all three of those in the entire global consumer bank so in but I think was done very purposely because again of real effect change we need to have a common narrative cross that we need to have like the only ones reasons we did was  Donna Tomic design language so that all those experiences can look similar sort of studios can design similarly we have a philosophy in design thinking we have a common visual language in our design language and that between those things we then start to have a framework that we can build against started kind of leverage universally across all the sort of stuff but then it it allows us like I said universally accounts okay like look that this is not a process for the way that we do this to help kind of moved that needle through all these different organizations  next question is %HESITATION if you're the only designer in a company how do you convince the leadership of that business of the value of design  yeah it's it's interesting I get  I get the question from individual designers I get it from the heads are designed some of the biggest companies in the world %HESITATION I think a lot of it is and how do you show value  and I think that value can come in a lot of different forms I think you know I was talking to somebody recently after I had done a talking came up with blood in internal design team and I like look what how do I get less dependent on agencies how do I find more value for that and and again I think that's showing it financially the you know look there's been designed has value it has value through the way things convert it has value through yeah I just I a lot of different things like that you have the ability to speak business and I think that us as an organization that's why a lot of times they'll ask me I'll say like look should be you know you you do a lot of work in digital said should a designer learn to code us notice learn business  because if you can't translate that creativity into a form of the business can consume in value it's lost its it just becomes like %HESITATION they're like you know in the corner wearing a beret doing a watercolor spirit animal like it's just like what so no I  it is it is how do I translate that into value I think the value then comes like I said before about it's not about assets about your vehicle class and is about creativity I I think there's a lot of that stuff but the hard part is if you are the individual designer  it in my experience it tends to be a very kind of binary equation because either you have somebody who is open to it he can have a conversation with you you can move over time and take those little steps or you have somebody that's just opposed to it and the problem is that you can't kind of your grass roots movements it's like okay well either I can do this or I can't but I think it but it is for me the the like I said the the philosophy still applies even a big companies because I think even at Starwood for the great work that we did there was a lot of stuff that was done skunk works like me in a developer nights and weekends to do a proof of concept put in front of the business so we can get a little bit of money like with mobile we got a little bit of money to the mobile website and then we do a little bit more and we did a bad app then we got a lot more money than we did a good app and then the like to start working with apple and that so it started in these very humble kinda like skunk works way it wasn't they just showed up and when we get it we understand it anyone can walk in and say I need a million dollars to put five people on this yeah I know and and again because I like I had to demonstrate consumers would be either had to demonstrate there was value there I did I'm sure there was revenue there that you know that and I did that was gonna be the sort of thing that yes we all we're gonna still have jobs for doing this sort of thing but I think it's just looking out and say okay for my business for this person how do they define value and then how can I search %HESITATION merchandise that how can I start to go back and point out it performed better how can I start doing AB tests like that was a big one that I used to use it was like great let's do the crappy design let's do the better design and let the numbers prove it out  and I think even at city I guess one thing we do is we test constantly because again if you're to bring design into an organization two hundred years old design is like a year and a half old  very subjective put in front of consumers constantly not subjective  so  we get in here %HESITATION as the purpose of design continues of all what are some roles and methodologies that you think might emerge over the next five years  you know I think that for me it it really is the hope that there are there are creative heads not designed heads critter has meaning that these are the people they can come in and really can take charge you can lead a company and the way they think their problems all that they can do those sort of things that you know yes there's always going to be the the design the with the ability to execute it but I think because the one thing that I looked out of the one thing over the course of my career that I've seen  the need for companies who can show up with people who have ideas who can change things will not go away  consumers will change technology will change like all that other stuff that surrounds it will change the core need to communicate hasn't changed and and because I just think like you look at all the technology in the world you'll get all the stuff it's no better than that ten  if I have nothing to write if I have nothing to say to draw to communicate in a way that move somebody  Auburn at Penn can be Shannon io shiny fancy animated whatever but that's the thing I think is a is I think that you were getting to the point in the matured in the industry we can start to see past the technology to see that it is about ideas I think it's just can we learn from that can we learn the importance of content of communicating because I I half suspect Gutenberg invented the print press and his best friends on stage going now contents  the king for her we are still having the same discussion but it but that's what I mean is I I think that like I said they're all these opportunities business the fact that there is a head of design at a bank  lose the opportunity I think the fact that you know you started it started twenty eight to that point where the companies like that see the value in design where we see so many of these you know so much town is going to in house teams this because this trend is happening I think it's up to us as an industry can we step up and take advantage of it can we lead can we make it about more than just pretty pictures can we make it about business changing ideas and being the ones they can have help shepherd that change because if you do that  all the doors open but I think it's it's the challenge of us embracing that of understanding that process and an understanding a role in doing that because I think that those are the roles that will change companies those are the ones and again I think that's why so many people want to look to start ups because they were they started with that thinking baked in but it's the bridge of how do I get from big Dan to never had and I think that's where those roles are gonna come most even that's a fantastic place this is great thank you so much thank you so much for
