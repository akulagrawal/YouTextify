my name's in France I'm twenty eight and I am a user experience researcher %HESITATION on the Google maps team at Google %HESITATION and I make about a hundred and thirteen thousand dollars a year when I started I was actually a contractor so I was actually making an hourly wage and I contracted for about nine months before my team realized that they actually had need for a full time researcher and they converted me to full time and it became a real live Google employee %HESITATION when I was %HESITATION hourly my rate ended up being about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year but of course you have contractor taxes you don't get all the perks you don't get bonuses so when I converted my %HESITATION salary went down but my overall package actually increased a little bit so that included stock options for a one K. matching %HESITATION and like I said the the daily bonus so Google %HESITATION obviously makes a lot of products %HESITATION it's a huge company and I focused primarily on the maps team maps encompasses you know probably everything you're familiar with Google earth the map of self driving %HESITATION local businesses %HESITATION anytime you open up that map it's something that I've touched in some way my main responsibility is to collaborate with project managers and designers %HESITATION and give them insights about our users that they can enter and put into our products so for example if I go to a designer and say Hey  you know women aren't using Google maps for X. Y. and Z. reasons they say okay we'll figure out how to address X. Y. and Z. in our design and make it more appealing to in this case women or whoever might need to use it specifically the part of Google maps I work on is an app called Google my  business and Google my business is a tool that allows business owners to %HESITATION claim their business on Google maps which means that you can go to your listing you can change your hours you can respond to reviews and photos and basically control how your %HESITATION how your business appears on Google I think open mindedness inquisitiveness curiosity and surprisingly like good communication skills I think a lot of people who are drawn to research %HESITATION kind of introverted nerds like me and you know when I started I thought like all just be able to sit in my lap or my office all day and just churn out cool research and then throw it people and they'll say wow this is great like we're just going to take this and where is interested in the subject is you are and I turned it turned out that was not the case like you actually have to brand yourself and sell yourself and probably thirty percent of my job is just communication and getting Brian from my team and not actually doing the research itself so if you are somebody who can engage really well the people around you and communicate and %HESITATION build interest in what you have to say then you should probably be a good researcher I think I made a lot of mistakes early on in terms of %HESITATION not connecting my inquiry enough with the product so for example it's not really enough to say here's a cool finding you have to say here's a cool finding and here's how it applies to your product and here's how it's going to improve your product and really make that connection really strong and I used to put a little too much benefit of the doubt and how much %HESITATION mental work designers and product managers were willing to do  terms of interpreting my research like you really have to spell it out so I think I'm most of my early mistakes were in being a little too vague about the product application of what I was doing which came a little bit from my academic background where you can just talk about whatever and you don't have to apply it to any kind of hope world scenario but %HESITATION when you're in industry have to be very very specific about where your research is going and justifying it properly I feel incredibly lucky that I kind of stumbled upon this career path when I was a kid I super randomly wanted to be a car truck tiger for like I found this book about how to draw maps as like that's what I want to do for the rest of my life and I was like that's not really a job anymore because I'm not a pirate so he couldn't really to that and I thought about doing other stuff  %HESITATION but the thing that I kept landing on as for it being this driving leveling no matter what I was at into or %HESITATION you know I kind of I dabbled in a lot of ideas for what I want to be when I grew up but they all involved  being currently kind of pursuing this independent inquiry and being able to like really dive into something and learn everything I could about it like I wanted to go into forensics and I took a class in blood spatter analysis knows mostly because I was really obsessed with dexter at the time but everything I did involves learning a lot about what I was into  and I didn't really know how to turn that into a  %HESITATION past because like I said like this didn't really exist when I was in high school and through a lot of luck and hard work but a lot of like an  %HESITATION where I get to just  sit by myself and learn everything about maps and I get to like actually get to be the cartographer of the future in a way it's really fun
