%HESITATION %HESITATION  so I'm not a mac or three and I'm director of hardware engineering here at Facebook  I leave the group that that builds %HESITATION and develops that hardware is the servers storage and the racks are the Facebook users to run a website  can you tell me about the process of prototyping and a new server usually starts out a white board %HESITATION like so many things to %HESITATION and then often times they run down here and start building hack where the mechanical lab right now which is %HESITATION which is a fun spot because that's where a lot of our early innovation takes place this is a lot like your high school shop %HESITATION we have the sheet metal benders and a band size and the table saw and all the fun dangerous toys %HESITATION that we normally get to high school students but in in this case %HESITATION we let our engineers play with and this is where we play with early idea you know we do a lot of early work and just bending sheet metal cutting balsa wood or plywood gluing things together because a lot of it is really understanding how the new design might functional scale how humans interact with that and how the technology lays into a new enclosure or a new form factor  there are so many people in our industry who designed servers get have never seen a production data center they've never been out to one they really don't know what the real experiences and what the opportunities are you need to know very well the people who use your products into the experience you're creating %HESITATION it is insufficient to just write it write a paper about it or or to have somebody else write a paper and you read it you really need to to walk a mile in their shoes  you know some people follow that straight and narrow path with an engineering degree and %HESITATION right into an engineering job and I I was not one of those people it started when %HESITATION I was actually even in middle school %HESITATION a friend of mine's dad was a real tanker this is early days of like IBM PC's in the eighties and I go over my friend's house and we try to fix and that led to my first job which was computer repair to my high school job was working at the local PC repair shop you know fixing old IBM PC's and two eighty sixes and it has some really old %HESITATION clicking here but that's how I really built a passion for computer hardware when I was looking at at college I'd met %HESITATION %HESITATION with a friend of my dad's over Microsoft and his advice was actually to not get a computer science degree he said you know we we see tens of thousands of four point GPA computer science grads every year and lightly that's a very hard way to get into Microsoft and he said go take a year computer science learn the basics teach yourself the rest and go learn something you can apply go learn some other skill that works with computers that adds a lot more depth of what you do and so my passion about photography for a long time %HESITATION and try to win after photography degree and you know took a background in computer science and math while I was in college %HESITATION but then I dropped out  he didn't finish I didn't finish known now and as a as a matter of fact I I have one quarter left of my degree  let imagine at your level doing server engineering for face but there aren't very many people that you can get advice from our our industry for a long time was so silent data center operators just didn't talk the great part about OCPD open compute project we build is we've for the first time created a community where data center operators and industry leaders can come together because at the end of the day no one wants to do the clicking of work we wanted to the innovative work if we spend all our time reinventing the wheel Microsoft reinventing the wheel because no one sharing their wheel design we all go slower if we can share the wheel design if we can get off the ground on the basic stuff in the innovation just speeds up  I'm gonna take over your job tomorrow and I'm just starting from scratch what the most important thing I need to know how do I prepare  I see myself as more of a service ran to the people on my team %HESITATION in fact I a %HESITATION I draw our charts upside down it's a silly detail but I put myself in the bottom half of the engineers on the top because the way I see my world is I'm here to support them the engineers the one to actually build things and so for my job it's a supporting role playing that's the first thing and the second is really get to know the context of your work get to know you know the data center environment yourself get out there I will cause the technician not just my engineers but I'm actually out in the data center %HESITATION fixing service myself I do it multiple times per year %HESITATION and so I think it's really important as the leader of the team to know why we're doing what we're doing but problems were solving and broadly sort of %HESITATION what the overall mission of Facebook and the Facebook infrastructure demands  any one of these servers you know any little thing could go wrong with that you find yourself are you a perfectionist you have to be a perfectionist you really don't actually in in fact %HESITATION you know perfection is the enemy of execution %HESITATION if you're a perfectionist you never build anything and so we're hackers we move really fast we build creative things but we also understand that there will always be concerns in the field you always learn more I would tell tell my team to reserve the right to be smarter tomorrow than you are today and and part of that is you know if if it's looking good let's get some out in the field %HESITATION because in a way we have the world's largest test lab if you think of us as a hardware company nobody has a bigger test lab %HESITATION they we do in terms of of a data center environment where we can try things  yeah so some reason is issue what is the way that you kind of unwind and thought you know it's it's silly I'm I'm honored %HESITATION and so for me on a winding is is more technology I hack I I script %HESITATION I code a little bit badly automating my house drive my wife crazy just learning how to sort of program %HESITATION little connected devices at home you know little things like that that I love working on it and so when I go home it's well you know it's more technology and a lot of ways it's it's playing with the the fun little %HESITATION little fiddly bits
