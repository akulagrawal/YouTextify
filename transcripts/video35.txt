hello everyone and welcome to invision star design talk of twenty sixteen today we're chatting with the Jack got health leading lean thinking and decided Angelus about his experience from five years teaching writing about and practicing the wax I'm Margaret Kelsey I'm our content and community manager here at invasion and I'm gonna be taking over our Twitter feed for the next hour the hashtag for today is invasion weapon are you can tweet me any questions and comments you have weapon are I'm gonna have my finger on that reach me at and and just look into the questions at the end of this talk if you happen to forget that hash I you can take a peek over our Twitter work envision out with an eye and we just we  also we're gonna be giving away a surprise gift to the person at the best week today either comment or question extra points if you use gas and we are recording the weapon are we're gonna have that recording in a recap on her blog in a few days in case you have to hop up early or you want to pass along to friends and colleagues I'm gonna be sending you an email with a link to that recap and any other leagues we discussed today so keep an eye on your inbox for that that's it for housekeeping without further ado I would like to present to you Jack Jack welcome let's start by you telling us a little bit about yourself  thanks for the really great to be here folks thanks so much for %HESITATION for tuning in today %HESITATION little background about myself %HESITATION I've been building and designing digital products closing in on twenty years not quite twenty years yet %HESITATION and spending the the first two thirds of their career as a designer of some kind of information architecture you ex designer interaction designer  you know the the various titles that come  with that with that discipline and really in the last third of my career so far %HESITATION I've been  working on building design teens and until then cross functional product development teams in an increasingly agile world and the conversation that I want to have today  is  what I've learned is particularly in the last five years from  talking about menu X. teaching it consulting a practicing it both in house and out and %HESITATION and and you can get a sense of of what your experience as a band and have you asked some questions and I can respond to those questions via the Twitter conversation as well as other channels as well this talk is structured in three  three of  if you will first act as ruler of historical look where did this where did this idea come from what drove this conversation what %HESITATION  motivated us to go looking for a better way to practice product design second act is really focused on where the practice is today what I've seen what I've learned and one of the big things that have emerged from the last five years of this conversation around user experience design an increasingly international world and in the last act is really focused on future what does the you know what does the future look like for this practice for designed for organizations that want to work this way and what does it mean to manage teams that want to work its way that's really the the focus of the of of the next thing about  thirty minutes or so and so would without %HESITATION without any further ado  this  our journey for me started about ten years ago when I was appointed as the  the director of user experience at a company in New York called the latter the latter's was a start up that was working in a fairly traditional waterfall style and my job was to build a design team of user experience design team in that organization as it was beginning its transition into agile software developed for the engineering team was becoming Angelo was transformed into a more agile software engineering team at my job was to to build the design team within not construct now ten years ago if you would want to Google search for agile and U. acts together this is what needs to be such a trail of tears right people people writing and walking about how these are two two ideas that don't belong together there's no way these things should work designer saying agile sucks and you're saying that there's no way design can can fit into this world really %HESITATION eight eight depressing %HESITATION search engine results page at that time but one thing that you can do when you come across as opportunities as though it's it's what we did at that time was we saw those as learning opportunities and so we took the the the folks who tried this and fill them with all that and we went back and forth for a while to try to understand what they tried and why it didn't work and based on those conversations we learned a ton at the very least about anti patterns and certainly about some one of the big some of the biggest challenges in making great product is on  great software engineering work well in it iterative agile fashion  so we began to tweak our process  and it  again we were very much a waterfall process team at that time with very discrete phases near death defying design develop test and deploy very standard software development life cycle stuff and  through these conversations the learning began to try different approaches we try to take that for the first thing that we did was we took our design phase we just try to cram it into two weeks went  and that of course did work out well because we couldn't get enough work done and certainly not in time for actual development to take place not in that sprint as well and then we try to do %HESITATION the staggered sprint model where we kind of designed ahead of the engineers that and it's not working so well because again I was that's simply  %HESITATION just smaller wonderful we tried a variety of different things and finally finally finally it seemed after about six months of trial and error and we had we had the privilege of trial and error we have the the executive support to trying to figure this out G. R.  the  conversation seem to mellow out about this the number of complaints seem to die down it really seems like we have hit our stride and I was feeling pretty good about myself I think yes we solve this we figured it out everything's going great and I was and I came into work one Monday morning kind of you know on cloud nine feeling good about how I think we actually solve this problem and then sitting on my desk on my keyboard on that Monday morning when I came in was a piece of paper although  the paper was this diagram  now I can give you a few seconds to digested this diagram but you're staring at it and so give me a sense of of what this diagram once  as it turned out  part of the reason  the conversation I die down was that my team had gone off on their own and had this session where they vented to each other  about everything that they thought was broken in our product design and development process  and the output of that session was this diagram not doesn't take very much time to figure out this isn't exactly a diagram of positivity cry if you look at the title up at the top it says you accept the latter's diagramming and negative environment but it's already got a sense of what this is about and then as you kind of follow all the boxes and arrows into the center of the diagram it says that this is a U. S. of the ladders and it's particularly doing design in an agile environment  it's a negative environment that fosters failure and generates low morale in this case was a big punch in the face for me you know trying to figure out what you know what I'd really best here and really where the the flaws were in the way that we were working and what this turned out to be was really  in a moment in my thinking in in in the way that we were working together as a cross functional team of designers engineers and product managers and there's a lot to take in in this diagram I'm gonna call out a few of these things but not not everything but I want to show you kind of some some of the ideas that are in your that help us shift our thinking so specifically is this idea that the best six  never ever gets built and that was the design teams feeling right there is this sense %HESITATION in waterfall  you're practicing incremental software development so you work for nine months every year and you build stuff  and then the project ends and the next project begins and you build more stuff  now what the letters had done at that particular time instead of taking that that frame of mind  NBA condensed down to two weeks prince  and so we were practicing essentially incremental quote unquote agile software design and development so we working for two weeks building stuff and that would work for another two weeks build more stuff and it would work for another two weeks and build more stuff so we never went back  it actually iterate it on this as it was meant to be an iterative product development philosophy about we because we never went back and fix things we only did the best that we could in two weeks we never built the best experiences and because of that the U. Eckstine didn't feel business critical because they were doing just enough work to make sure that these features could make it out the door in that two week cycle  and then moving on to the next thing and so in many cases really more of a production job in a strategic jobs of the the the feeling of being connected to the company connect to the mission alignment was completely missing from that Congress from the conversation with the designers for sure  another thing that's key that the team was frustrated with was that the sense of the actual projects never ended the nice thing about waterfall again is that there's a beginning and there's an end and so we work for nine months or a year or whatever it is you ship launch you have  RT you get a T. shirt right to your with the project name on it and you move on to the next initiative  now agile which is this could this continuous stream of two weeks friends  building shipbuilding shipbuilding ship building check and and no sense of don when we finished with something when when when we actually finished this really give us a sense that we were listening  what we should be  what the definition of done should actually be in waterfall it's shaping the future put an agile the definition of done fundamentally changed talk about that in just a second but that really was a bit of being like Bob moment for us there is well  another complaint for the design team was this no ideation time because we're we're did was feeling they were just feeding V. the agile development machine the software engineering machine that had to get features out every two weeks design team didn't feel like they have any time to I eighty eight in part of the reason here is because we were operating as an internal agency as opposed to dedicated designers on strong teams and so people working on whatever they could whenever they had band with and so they can't just enough work to get things out the door and so that's that was a big one for us there as well and then lastly there was this conversation run minimum viable product which persists to this day in which %HESITATION addressed directly just a few minutes but we had a sense of what minimally Bible was certainly engineers had their sense of what minimal revival what marketers at a different sense  product had a sense and executives are different sense and so when we ready to ship was a never ending conversation about is a good or not should we do it should we not do it and and really reconcilable across the organization was a big turning point for us into using all the material in this %HESITATION sheet in in this in this diagram what really helped us to start thinking about our process even even more into it rated and moving forward  and once we figured out how to address all of these and  second I wrote an article about five years ago on smashing magazine and it's called lean you axe getting out of the deliverables business now smashing magazine is a terrific platform with a ton of of designers and design curious people are paying attention to that and it started off this tremendous conversation about how deep the practice of you ex has to shift in the context of the agile software development and so this article got a lot of traction which led to a lot of this being on stage talking to a lot of people hearing from a lot of people teaching a lot of people %HESITATION it led to the lien you X. book %HESITATION which came out about three years ago and that that created even in the even bigger conversation about this went on to do when you access the musical %HESITATION  two hundred  but what in front if we did but really what more interesting than that it led to a new acts the hash tag right if you if you're on Twitter and I see that you are is a terrific conversation that goes on all day every day under this hash tag but all things we knew X. who's doing what who's trying new things and then lastly  it's just me on airplanes a lot traveling around meeting with companies working with companies consulting and teaching %HESITATION coaching in some capacity is a variety of different companies have different sizes in different districts in in that time I've learned a ton through those conversations and most importantly they were too big themes that emerged from all of these conversations these talks these conferences needs these blog posts and articles and books and so far and and they're this design has to change we could not continue to work the same way we've always wanted to work the way that we've been doing design user experiences on simply had which I wanna talk specifically explicitly about how design has to change that's what's one thing I will talk about explicitly how just a second but but equally as importantly product development the way we make the sausage also has to change that's not such a design that has to change the way that work  but also product development and I want to talk about exclusive late about each one of these things and so first and foremost let's talk about the three big learnings for design okay so the three biggest things have come out of the last five years how does not have to change is this first and foremost it's the sense that we have to move away from archives  and move towards a transient artifacts in other words we take a lean approach to design deliverable the question you need to ask yourself is what's the least amount of design that I have to do  to communicate  my thinking to the person that I need to communicate it to so for example if you're sitting next to a developer designer product manager executive and you you have an idea you want to share with them  you know sketch like the one on the screen is perfectly viable if that gets the conversation across and moved forward one step  if you have to communicate that to somebody who is removed from the process maybe something of higher fidelity can do that sometimes for customers we have to take an even higher fidelity approach  the doing that but the idea is to do just enough work  to communicate what you needs to communicate to move the conversation forward to the next step not to the end right but just to the next step you know and this came from a lot you know it in my career especially in the early days and spent a ton of my time writing design specification documents  and you know twenty to thirty percent of those documents actually of the pages that I wrote in this document actually got implemented there's so much waste  being thrown away on every project there had to be a better way this this this thinking that we have to move towards transient or the facts right just move the conversation for and what you're doing in this is our second thing is %HESITATION when courage in the culture of the %HESITATION radical transparency right we're not waiting until the work is quote unquote finished we're not hiding behind our monitors for an extensive period of time we're not excluding non designers from the design conversation  we want to bring people into this conversation as quickly as possible so they can give us their feedback on whether this is viable when this is feasible whether this makes  instead that opening up the design process is a keen Keene learning for practicing a mini rex in an increasingly agile and lean and lean world how do we make the design process much more visible right his traditional waterfall design is this black box you know requirements come in on one and something magical happens in the middle and shiny stuff comes out the other we've got to open up that that black box in the middle and let other folks in quickly so that they can give us feedback so that we can accommodate that feedback is close to real time as possible enough the last big thing for the with a design has to change so we have to start moving away from these very formal interrogation style designer views into a much more continuous informal conversation so if we take this approach a radical transparency and we're moving away from archives into transient artifacts of design what we start to facilitate is a continuous informal conversation about what we're designing  does this work does not work how should be should be you tweak this approach doesn't make sense for the business doesn't make sense for the grand vision of the of the project of the company system right and in the stars to kind of G. D. %HESITATION %HESITATION it reduces the stigma over the design process it reduces the the fear server that I had as a young designer over design reviews write those within the the most dreadful meetings that I ever had to deal with it's really opening up the conversation communicating with the least you know that the minimum viable sort of communication artifacts  and then moving forward as you gain  more interest more validity more agreement both from the market and from your colleagues for your design approaches the fidelity of those communications of those artifacts goes up it's number we need to start in most cases as the three things for how design at the change equally as important is how product development had to change because we can't change alone in our silo to store working in this more collaborative way everybody around design designers have to shift their process as well and I think fundamentally  it's asking the question so what product development when I mean much engineering product management business business analysis marketing center has to start asking the question so what shipping features  has been the measure of success  for ever  a new measure of success is shifting customer behavior so just because we shipped it doesn't matter anymore the real question is so what did somebody use it  it's somebody use it again if they tell their friends about it did we make the more successful  did we make them better at their job did we get them promoted to be get them home in time for their kids soccer game right so what just because we shipped it didn't actually solve a real customer needs and if it didn't we have to shift that and this is a big question the product itself and has to continually ask and the reason that we have to continue we ask that is because the pace of learning  the amount of learning that any team in any organization can do today has to reflect the re  holidays of marketing  what I mean by that other %HESITATION search the realities of the market three hundreds of marketing the realities of the market what I mean by that is that suffers become continuous suffers not a not a thing that you're going to buy and install and then and then %HESITATION you know use again what some suffer could be deployed again and again and again as quickly as we walked because of that we can build a continuous feedback loop with the market to learn whether what we're shipping makes sense or not again to put a fine point on this Amazon ships code to production to production to real people  every eleven point six seconds  okay some Amazon customers somewhere in the world she's a change to their experience five times a minute  that's insane right that's crazy crazy stat but the reality is that everyone of those deploys every eleven point six seconds gives Amazon opportunity to learn something was it a good idea it wasn't a bad idea how did it affect customer behavior and because of that what we're doing is we're building a continuous conversation with the market and this is really the fundamental shift a product development has to think about is the planning efforts and initiatives for the kind of moving away from projects and more disease continues initiatives it gives us the opportunity to ship sense and respond  to the things to to the projects that we're giving for shipping right let's get ideas out there super quickly and figure out whether or not they're good ideas and we do that by sensing the impact that those ideas have one customer behavior  and based on the positive and negative things that we sense we  respond right we do more of that stuff if it's good we optimize it be deployed more people we make it better or we rode back  if it's not good it doesn't affect customer behavior in a positive way interesting thing and the biggest challenges in this particular group is this  shipping continuously is an organizational investment of time and will the organization has to want to ship continuously and they have to and they have to invest the money so it's it's actually  money and will the organization simply has to pay for the infrastructure to support continues deployment they have to want to do that sensing the impact  of the software that we ship  is a matter of money and will same thing your organization has to want to measure  and they have to invest the money in the systems and the people in the efforts to measure  responding is a cultural shift  responding means that we are explicitly admitting to the organization that we might be wrong  and that's key here because in many organizations it is not okay to admit that you're wrong  but the simple sense of saying I'm going to respond to something that I've learned from the market means that I may not get it right the first time  it has to be safe for you to learn reading experiment for you to be wrong in your organization in order to be able to respond  quickly and in real time to the idea to the to the metrics in the inside of the feedback that you're sensing for everyone's deploys  that's the toughest part and that's where I think this conversation is moving in the future organization  has to shift to support the ship's sense and respond model right the the collaborative conversations T. V. %HESITATION see the continuous learning that we can now build and to do so  we have to use some new tools and some new ways of thinking most importantly an organization has to take on a position of humility  a position of humility  says that we don't know what the answer is going to be  suffered Velma is complex and unpredictable with a sense of the business problem with a sense of how of strategically what we'd like to be is a business we have a sense tactically but how would like to execute against that we can't predict whether that will work and exactly what shape that will take in this is such a big admission  top down bottom up from the organization to say we're working on a set of assumptions that we need to prove whether those assumptions are right or wrong but even example from a situation I ran into %HESITATION I can't do a survey can't do a show of hands unfortunately in a web in our context but %HESITATION you know think about this question a typical survey would ask you how many view you know  run and while you're running which you because we take photos along the way and then you upload those photos to social media now my sense in having run this this particular exercise in rooms with it with a live audience typically you know a third of the room raises their hand it says were runners and then about  you know the speech of the surfers were out of the sun was rising in the adrenaline was flowing so for me it was a this was a no brainer I absolutely wanted to to push the the go MVP but not like the fact that it's an eight and I push the button and the map my I run the app said to me that's great give us thirty dollars and you can do this  to which of course I wasn't I replied with a sad trumpet sound you know wall wall I'm not gonna pay thirty Bucks for us for this feature but think about this for just a second if not my run had sent out a survey  or made an executive decision based on the gut instinct it says no one's gonna pause the run to upload photos  while the running right they would have made product decisions that in theory could have been false instead they chose a position of humility and they're running experiments to learn whether people would actually want this feature and how much people are willing to pay all the features that you see on the screen right now never have to exist  if people don't click on going the P. and yes I will give you this much money for it  this was the minimum viable product this was their test and based on real market feedback  they can then determine where to invest the resources which features to work on this again is a position of humility that says we're going to let the value emerge from the market and the reason for that is because we want to take small risks because the future is foggy right  we can take a guess we have some insight about our customers behavior we can see a few steps into the fog that's ahead of us but we can't see too far and by taking the small steps  we learn continuously  I know we had just our planning in our thinking based on those new learnings to make sure that we're taking the proper pass through the fog is another example this is the first  Twitter homepage  there's not a single mention on here of the hash tech  why because it wasn't planned right the hashtag emerged  three use of the system in fact in two thousand and seven Christmas Cena suggested the first half  and what's amazing about this is the Twitter noticed that as a value that people were using they let that value emerge in their system into a position of humility adopted that as a key feature of the product and now to monetize will feature because you can place ads against specific hash tag and not value emerge from the system and that's another example assuming a position of humility but what to work on and where we should focus our efforts and how we should design  now another thing to keep in mind is that it doesn't matter how many times you've been right before  right I would ask you can all get a hold of your Amazon fire phone's if I could I could see it in my guess is that zero if you would be holding them up at the moment right this is another example where a highly successful entrepreneur Jeff Bezos decided that he wanted to build a product to compete with the iPhone's  and he in his teens baked a ton of assumptions  in two  the making of the fire phone and it bought and the company took a hundred and seventy million dollars right down on unsold inventory because of all the false assumptions baked into this and get a fast company article about this project they talk to the people who worked  on this project and they ask them why why did you work on the stuff what did you do this why why did you choose these features why did you design it this way overwhelmingly their answer was because Jeff once  if you think about it for a second right excluding in fact he's the boss and a fire you if you don't do what he says  right think about his track record if you were to be so as a new look at Amazon and Amazon web services right all the businesses that he's got that have been successful if they were gonna go the phone is there are gonna go I'm gonna go with this right because this guy's been so successful but the reality is that every new project every new initiative is filled with assumptions position of humility encourages us to test those assumptions to make sure we're not spending time or money on the wrong things as the fire phone illustrates the way that we do that is through experimentation children experiment that about my run she worked on but we run these experiments as quickly as we can to learn what we need to learn and this experimentation is at the heart of the concept of the minimum viable product I really like is this diagram of what a minimum viable product is I think is a really good job of explaining it and really answering the question every time you think about the minimum viable product I talked about this in that latter starring grant right if you want to settle the the discussion about minimum viable  product this is the question that every MVP sets out to answer right what's the smallest thing that we can make or due to test our assumptions  sometimes that is a model overlay sometimes it's a paper prototype sometimes it's a code alive code prototype sometimes it's a fully fledged working product it really depends on what you're trying to learn but you only want to do the minimum amount of work that you need to do to learn whether your assumptions are true or false and the more that you practice this the better you get it doing less work doesn't mean actually you're being lazy it just means not wasting your time doing work that you don't need to do as you go learnings  into your product you get a rate you build a a and another standing of what's right in your assumptions and what's wrong for example what's on the screen here is wrong and we all know this I took this picture in my house just so you know live with this %HESITATION and when we get it wrong we fix it right and we've proven until until the feedback from the market says this is positively impacting customer behavior  interestingly enough as you running these experiments you're collecting evidence collecting data and that data provide you an objective measure of success  right and so the types of data that we collect is quantitative data obviously right what people are doing with the product and features themselves and this qualitative data but but you won't notice both sides to this %HESITATION you're talking to people to understand why to build a three hundred  sixty degree view of what's happening with our products thing but I want you to take away from this weapon are is this  research is part of the cycle  research is a crucial piece of software product development as much as reading code we're designing or ready copy what marketing %HESITATION or she wear anything else it has to be a part of the software development loop it has to be part of it every iteration it has to be part of every cycle because research that continues conversation with the market provides us with a sense of whether or not working on the right things and soon as we can find out that we're not we can change course through that fox now this loop of shipping sensing and responding humility connecting evidence builds responsiveness into your teens and into your organizations because as a new things come your way you increase your team in your organization's agility and therefore their ability to respond to whatever you're working on because you're taking small steps much huge steps so it's easy to change course and when you've got responsiveness baked in to your team and your organization's you can kind of always being this guy right this is the guy that you want to be in any situation matter what's going on around you your call your cool your collected leaning back drinking a beer because you know that you can handle it right you ready to react to the market your customers through learnings in a very  easy and and methodical mathematical way and the reason the data were collected  gives us a sense of are we actually changing customer behavior we can measure that we can measure how customers use our product a satisfied they are likely under recommendation move that for  and the nice thing about that is that the evidence that we collect allows us to determine our progress on a project remember shipping is just the beginning of the conversation  but we can measure how well we're optimizing based on the changes a customer behavior and we can decide what we want to find right so if we keep building in optimizing something and it doesn't seem to move the metrics the customer behavior metrics forward  maybe we decided that's not worth investing in anymore and we should invest somewhere else and that gives the organization evidence based method to choose where to invest in what a fun they're fine  now to kind of wrap all this up I want you to take this home this changes everything there's a business level impact here of practicing the new axe and practicing lean thinking and it %HESITATION this product development in your organizations for agencies for services companies this means that you have to rethink your business model you're no longer selling specs or features or power point decks or OR prototypes use your selling time you're someone value and you're selling out comes right no more fixed deadlines and fixed scope  instead we once a collaboration risk mitigation and successful experiences based on changes in customer behavior  this is a big change for most agents  sees %HESITATION and %HESITATION and it's still it's a difficult one because it means selling differently staffing differently and and really creating new relationships with your clients if you work on in house teams and also changes everything right no more internal agencies when one of the cross functional teams product design engineer wanna be transparent about everything that we're doing let everybody see what's happening one of value learning over delivery so let people see that we've learned this works or that this didn't work right we want to create a safe environment to experiment to change direction depends it  if necessary  right  really great way to start this process by the way if you are an in house team is to simply remain your teens think about this for just a second right if we want to focus on building successful customer outcomes as opposed to successful features try this if you work in a team that's called the iPhone app team what's your mission as a team  your mission is to ship the iPhone app if you just change the name  of that team to the mobile commerce teen  what's the mission of that team  that team is to get people buying more stuff through the the mobile channel that community apt  it could mean %HESITATION a you know a mobile web product it could mean a cheer located service using begins who knows what the team gets to decide what the best thing implementations are to solve for this business problem and make sure those moments throughout the organization and by prioritizing learning over growth we get the product faster we get ideas into market  faster we get a sense of what we want to work on and what we shouldn't be working on and that's really what this mean practices come to fruition because what they help us do is they help a shift from a culture of delivery  to a culture of learning which is the key transformational organizations have to take without also thanks for listening  and I'd love to take your questions I will to make one really quick plug before we take questions in this Josh Sidon and I have a new book coming out at the end of this year it's a business book for executives called sense and respond and if you're interested in it ocular sensing book dot com you can give me your email address and I'll be happy to send you an email when the book is available should be out later this year so what can I say thanks so much and I'd love to take your questions  awesome thank you so much Jack and in just a moment I'm gonna have to answer questions I encourage you guys to use Twitter hashtag envisioned weapon are to ask them but also feel free to use this go to weapon our question portal to segment and if you prefer I'm I'm going to launch a quick poll in just a moment once go to weapon are  lays nicely with me  %HESITATION  let's see  sorry for the delay  she  right well that's going up let's just go into the questions for now so and  Robbie asked as an ex Disney designer it AT ation was everything our ideas was everything's  how much ideation magic time do you suggest in a lean you acts and firemen  yeah so great question and really again as you saw in my ladders diagram at the beginning there ideation time was a keeping point that we try to deal with the the the trick to getting the right amount of ideation time and there's no magic number you know something forty two minutes that's that's it right %HESITATION the the trick to getting the right amount of ideation time on a per per sprints bases or initiative basis is to sit down with your colleagues and in engineering product management and to identify what you believe to be some of the more challenging design elements of the thing that you're working on  and then to prioritize those in the backlog in such a way that  you get the time that you need to do the ideation  on those ideas and the learning  one of the the team isn't necessarily sitting idle and waiting for you to complete that process so perhaps there's some technical work can be done and prioritized earlier in the backlog doesn't require as much design work and not buys you the time that you need to to to the design the ideation yeah in time for them to to %HESITATION you know for that for those stories to get up to the top of the backlog notebook  back on grooming can be a daily activity and if you're having daily stand ups and it looks like the the story that requires the the link fear ideation time is coming up soon %HESITATION then then you're comfortable with you can talk to your engineer since the king that's the point of having these cross functional strong teams is that you can speak with the engineers and say listen that card coming up there in a day is %HESITATION  I'm still working on that I have really nailed the interaction model for that yet %HESITATION can we find something else to prioritize ahead of that so I can finish up the transaction and I think I spoke with at work I think that that's key is that that conversation with your colleagues to negotiate for that time that you're looking at something that's that's us  more even more complex and it requires more than a couple of days perhaps ideation time that perhaps if it warrants doing kind of a bigger up front design sprinter research effort or we call the net and inception at neo that out with the team gets together gets all the kind of the assumptions out on the table and then there's a bit of design process that takes place that feeds into the first real %HESITATION  delivery sprint of the process itself but the key there is to communicate with your colleagues to give me a sense of what you need to negotiate a someone else has to be done by that time for yourself  great great advice so I think the polls actually playing along nicely so I'm going to launch this quickly and and go back to this for those of you who are currently collaborating with six or more people in your design process we've designed invasions enterprise platform specifically for teens like you are so it has some really powerful features that are included in our free professional or and team plans that enable your team to work lead so I know all closed again  all right  quick thank you Mister  %HESITATION one let's just all go back to will go back to some questions and I'll try  I figure that out stay tuned guys %HESITATION so let's see after Robbie Jonathan asked water suggestions for designers were you explained it in non design sinking non agile environments to help change the corporate culture  I was gonna say get another job somewhere else %HESITATION but %HESITATION because because it is a shortage of demand in most in most places for really great designs but it's a fair question and and and and the situation that I know a lot of designers find themselves and I think there's there's two key things here that will help you at least start the right conversation first do research right so so bring in if you if you're already U. S. mind if you are doing you know could you ex worker design work you've got the insight needed to have a good conversation with your colleagues with your executives with your manager's about investing more in a particular practice which want to collect that evidence first that's the first step in the second step perhaps even more crucial than the first step is to translate that evidence into language but the people that you're trying to convince actually care about if I if I could fault  you know the biggest fall that I've seen in teens time and time again is that they get super excited they collected all the state of this evidence that shows that something is broken or some is working well and we need to we need to make everything like that %HESITATION change everything and they and they run to the people that are trying to influence and they talk to them about pixels and margins and work flows and and and task completion rates and all of these things %HESITATION when when that person with all that  really cares about his revenues but profits or sales or resource utilization or or whatever you know net promoter score or whatever it is right make sure that you understand what matters to the people that you're trying to convince what gets them a raise what gets them promoted but gets their their boss to give them a Pat on their back right and translate your findings your evidence that you're already collecting because you're doing good you X. work  the language that they care about that's how to start the conversation right make it easy for them make it %HESITATION  adjustable right but in words that they care about right part of the reason why the lean startup book was so popular and and pissed off so many U. U. X. people right because the stuff that Eric was talked about in that book at least some of it is could you express distance researched customer development and you know you expect what we've been doing this for years for decades and the reason why I had such an impact one of one of the many reasons has had such an impact is because of the spoken to business people in business language and that's the key the key is to speak the language of the people that you're trying to  great and I think that I'm looking through some questions a lot of people kind of had that same question of how to bring %HESITATION bosses and other stakeholders he might just have a reluctance to that into the conversation and I I completely agree I think %HESITATION  re framing it into business conversation rather than just a design conversation is really important using they're they're kind of language as well absolutely  so David at Aston interesting question I'm he said doesn't quote unquote just enough design shift wasted time from design to  engineering went rework has to happen  no  question  although I mean I'm I'm not kidding about my answer joking with the next question it doesn't because look I think refactoring as much as we design is part of modern software development  right and so yes ultimately we have to build well constructed scalable secure war %HESITATION you know high quality software that that performs well in all of those things right in the early stages of validation before you've got a sense of exactly where you should be investing all of your time  just enough design allows us to do just enough engineering and that combination  doing that a parallel path of product discovering product livery allows us to build  learning  is this a good idea is it affecting customer behavior should be expand this out to a broader audience should be optimized this and yes certain point you may find out that this is something that's worth optimizing in which case that then you you will need to re factor it  right but I think that that's a part of modern software development today right drew the the risk is that you go for you know you you go forth and then you you develop the whole thing to to it to the highest possible quality and and performance levels and then it doesn't actually deliver the results that you need  right and that's really the end even bigger source of waste and so so my response is by working collaboratively in a parallel path for a discovery delivery process you learn more you learn faster but yes you will have to throw away some code  in the same way that designers have to throw a some design which which is it's just the  natural  that's that's learning  absolutely so this next question is interesting it's kind of a hybrid of of the last two questions but it focuses on this idea of being wrong such a Scott asked how does one advance lean you accident organization where management doesn't think it's okay to be wrong  yeah this is this is the toughest part this is by far the toughest part because this is the cultural shift that has to be adopted work why top down that says look are  I don't know all the answers and this is this is you know there's there's a significant amount of historical moments of inertia choose this style of management right  this comes from industrial manufacturing it's the way the management's been taught for years and this and this kind of this unspoken expectation that managers need to know everything and it's simply not true managers need need to leave the set vision need to offer guidance and direction certainly but but comes the software driven businesses and make a mistake all of us work in software driven businesses today if you work in a company of any kind of scale  our cannot predict  and and state of the software systems that will go with  there is no end state in fact let the continuous nature of of software today means that they they're never and never ends we just optimizing optimize improve it can do to make them better and so the challenge as as articulate and the question is to get management to see that again the most effective way is to use evidence right at hand and really this is with  the the the concept of a retrospective one of a kind of a core agile Ste ceremony is is really valuable also retrospective about the last project  right what did we think we're going to do during the approach without we're gonna do is fifty features what can we actually ship well we shipped the twelve of the original features and five things we never even thought of okay why did that happen  right terrific and kind of go through that process and see okay what we wanna do differently next time obviously somebody at the leadership level somebody without a whole lot to lose needs to facilitate that conversation do it tactfully  right now the the risk here inspect you make the people that you're trying to convince look stupid  right now your domain didn't either wrong the last project last ten projects you've been wrong but that's the risk and says you bubble up this evidence it has to be done gently actually in such a way that says look last time no Wheaton planned out the project for three months and work on it for twelve months and then we ended up shipping ten percent of what we actually thought we were going to ship right maybe this time let's just let's take a third of that planning time it was just a building something and see when a customer feedback we get or what is the will to research even up front just to make sure that we're we're deciding on building the right things and see how you can have that conversation if if time and again if if you meet with feedback that says I don't wanna hear about this or this is the way to work around here venue other deep cultural challenges there that it's going to be difficult for somebody not in an executive position to shift in which case I would say look for  like I said before there are lots of companies hi sedate for and looking for really great design  awesome so I think I finally got this to work walk me finally I know we've had some challenges today so thank you guys for for a hanging in there with us so this is about our invasions enterprise platform and if you guys are interested in learning about those additional features and getting a free trial of it just indicate so on this survey that I'm gonna keep up on the screen for a little bit and I will have any reach out to help you get set up but we'll continue with the questions while I keep that up on the screen and  so Rachel asked where's the line between bringing everyone into the design process along the way and dragging people down with too many meetings I know meetings now recently happened kind of bill aside  and rightfully so %HESITATION %HESITATION  so  good question %HESITATION I think what my response imma  you don't need a meeting to have a collaborative design focused conversation right %HESITATION necessarily there is an opportunity if you're working in his in his cross functional collaborative hopefully a colocated sitting together and if you're not then at least you're connected via some kind of a communication channel slacker video conference or what chat or whatever it is %HESITATION in which case you can you can initiate this ad hoc conversations  on an as needed basis seventy two the schedules working one on  efforts ever told you that stand up can you can come by my desk at three o'clock and take a look right so I think that the the ad hoc nature of it does away with a lot  the formalized meetings %HESITATION I agree I think I wouldn't call meetings are  simply for the sake of calling meetings other will be situations right like I mentioned earlier where the challenge that you're undertaking is complex it takes on a variety of systems customer marketing technology and %HESITATION before we go too far down the path it might make sense to pull everybody together for a couple of days or a week or whatever it is and really kind of hammer out office hammer through our assumptions some prototypes and cut it up and to get a better sense of how would like to focus to develop an effort in which case I think the bike front loading some of that work you're actually saving yourself downstream meetings because you you gonna run into those challenges no matter what %HESITATION and so let's let's front load that and then move those way but yeah I I'm I'm with I'm with you on not having too many meetings %HESITATION on  for every meeting they're having in choosing carefully who actually needs to be  yeah Margaret yes sorry I'm back and I was on mute for awhile and it's %HESITATION David asked in an agile environment where does user testing actually fit and  so that's that's the king but that that was coming point there at the end is that it fits in and  every generation  recycled you need to be talking to customers are getting some kind of customer feedback you know what I mean  step one tiny step back off that that absolute statement a mistake almost every iteration needs to have some amount of customer conversation %HESITATION here in Italy you expect we talk about %HESITATION user testing Thursday right every Thursday you three customers coming in at three for customers coming in the morning or you can schedule them via video conference or whatever it is and you're talking to them and that's just simply part of the sprint ritual it has to be there right that this is like I said it's it's  it's a key component of modern suffered about getting that real time market feedback and the ability for us to do that today is so high and so cheap and so efficient there's no excuse for not doing it sure fifteen years ago twenty years ago we had to go rent the you know the big room with a double sided mirrors and all the candy and and sit there for two days so much fifteen people say the same thing right over the course of two days we don't have to do that anymore there's so many great remote testing sweets like validate the end user testing and others right and and %HESITATION video conferencing tools and %HESITATION you know automated services for scheduling things that nature that getting three or four people  what are the current customers prospective customers strangers to talk to you on a weekly basis is not and %HESITATION not in %HESITATION  huge ask of any organization and so that's the key this is is simply part of the cycle  Wilson that Steve had an interesting question how do you measure humility  is it possible to measure %HESITATION that's a great question %HESITATION I don't know %HESITATION I've no one's ever asked me that and I have never really thought about it %HESITATION I think you can you can you can measure the send you can do sentiment analysis if you will on an organization you can have people you know kind of anonymously rate  two to five qualities of the team of the culture on a monthly basis to record on the basis and see how that trends  %HESITATION and perhaps get a sense of whether or not %HESITATION people feel aligned if you like your incisions transparent if you like it's safe for them to speak their mind that type of thing right so you could ask those questions of the team of an organization and have them respond anonymously on a regular a regular time frame engage the the the the changes in mood to see how that's affecting the dig deeper when you see spike's rallies that's coming off the cuff answer I've been given a telephone but that's what I would say yeah I I was kind of intrigued by that question I idea didn't know if there is any anything out there if anybody has been tackling not problem it seems kind of nebulous and what things look I mean I mean just to kind of touch on that I mean you can tell %HESITATION if an organization is transparent and its humble you know a lot bye bye some of their kind of outward facing communications as well right I think %HESITATION store Porterfield for example it's slack does a really great job of articulating both the company mission and vision externally and options speaking to the way that they work in hiring  towards his goals you can see by the public hires that they the publicly announced tires again make that that that he lives up to those things and so I think that there is there are certain qualities of leadership that you can sense externally to an organization but internally there's probably a  perhaps a more  qualitative with a measure  I'm Rachel asked you have any advice for college student who is an aspiring you ex designer  %HESITATION yes %HESITATION the most important thing is to start doing the work  so you can you can take classes and you can learn %HESITATION and it's important but I think the most support things start practicing the craft so you get the experience of doing the work itself  the key because again you can read all the books you want you can take all the workshops you want %HESITATION but but practicing the craft is key and in the second bit of advice that I would have is to learn how to code and that may be blasphemous to perhaps fifty percent of the population listening right now press I think it's absolutely important for designers to understand the medium that they're working in you don't have to become and a professional grade developer but I think you actually have to understand how you know what the internet is composed of what the total price are composed of the constraints and limitations their strengths  so that you know what you're designing for  hi I love that advice and I think that you can kind of goes back to the initial and question you're talking about and learning the language of developers and and you're also talking about learning the language of the business leaders to be able to kind of speak all this differently  which is and I think %HESITATION I always come back to designers speak a very visual language but I think the thing they also it's important to learn and those other kind of languages as well whether that's development and business and even copy writing and and things like that to be kind of slowly Rockwell around it  also %HESITATION were add a little bit over the hours I just wanted to to lobbed the last question up it's a very easy one Jonathan said Jeff will you do another mode shift event in NYC
