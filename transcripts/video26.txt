I was losing my name's Bobby Gosho and shared around it were sitting down with twenty five masters of the design industry if you join us for the last couple weeks we certainly been learning a lot we hope you've been learning a lot we're gonna continue to do that we're gonna sit down we're gonna talk about how the best companies in the world approach communicate and a poor design every single day in this episode we're speaking with Dave Littmann date is the B. B. design anyway to focus on his years at apple where he was the creative director of online retail how and when to use intuition versus data and how eBay users data  get to the episode after this quick message from our partner so stick around  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  Dave thanks for joining us thank you have a beer awesome %HESITATION so first question what's one thing about design that's clear to you that you don't think so but other people  %HESITATION  maybe it's maybe it is clear I don't know that the thing that comes into my mind is that there is this this tension as a designer between creativity  craft and being strategic %HESITATION and that is like this concert  tension that I think all designers tend to feel in one shape or form %HESITATION and when I you know when I grew up and went to college and all those things like it was all about craft it was all about craft and was all but the craftsmanship of being a quote unquote designer and I think that there's been this shift over over the years obviously where  you know you can't just show up without one component one that one skill set and %HESITATION I think we haven't figured out as a as an industry %HESITATION which one of those things leads in which one of those things are seeds and I think probably varies from moment to moment but I think that's something to me that I'm just I constantly see our teams %HESITATION trying to balance but we don't really talk about it %HESITATION or we haven't talked about a lot the past and it's something that just sort of continues to be popping into my head lately %HESITATION that I'm not sure if it's if it's fully understood by  by others how do you how do you know when  this specific one should read because your point I mean there are times where you actually yeah yeah I mean I think part of it is what the problem as you know %HESITATION I think that's probably the biggest the biggest thing %HESITATION I also think it's you know %HESITATION well I guess I guess it's probably the the biggest part is is what's the problem we're trying to solve %HESITATION and %HESITATION  when are we in the process and  one of the outside factors that are sort of pushing us through these decisions %HESITATION so I think that's it for me I think it's bridge really does come down the problem %HESITATION do you do you bring some visibility and do you spend a lot of time bringing visibility to the business with the designers that you work with that do you get them involved with %HESITATION the executives pitching's  the fact that absolutely it's part of our sort of growth trajectory at at eBay is to make sure that %HESITATION the people who are responsible for the decisions of you know a product design decision %HESITATION are are accountable for the things that they the the decisions they make and have the opportunity to share the rationale and %HESITATION you know doesn't happen every single day like when it's not just a parade of designers walking into the CEO's office and saying this is the thing I made in this is the thing you know %HESITATION but we we just try to spend a lot of time making sure that %HESITATION everybody knows how to articulate and defend their decisions as as a designer %HESITATION and it's it's it's good for everybody what are some of those exercises like  %HESITATION cutting in so you spoke about making sure that everyone else had articulated the fan yeah %HESITATION I don't know if we have like a formal training regiment in terms of like how what that is %HESITATION I think you know the the the the framing that we try to  set forward is you know you know always need to be set in context so that people understand and for us %HESITATION customer is the is the context that we're always trying to to to bring to light %HESITATION you know there's lots of forces within sight of any successful company it's the there's the internal forces there's the business and then there's the customer %HESITATION and we sort of fashion ourselves as champions of the customer to make sure that were always bringing the customer to the foreground %HESITATION and so it's super important for us to set the context of you know what their problem is what their journey is what the opportunities are around them %HESITATION  and make sure that we have a strong articulation of that before we get into any sort of like presentation of now what a what a solution might be sort of a lot of people know this but %HESITATION you spent three years at apple before you before you came here at at %HESITATION before that you your partner at your own small design firm that's right you left to go to apple %HESITATION I find really interesting is the timing of the whole thing you went to apple in twenty eleven %HESITATION you  while you were there for three years grew into %HESITATION the head of the retail online retail yeah the design their credit credit doctor for yeah yeah exactly %HESITATION  and you joined when when you know Steve was still alive you know he wasn't there but he was certainly a presence yeah how did how did design change like the approach to design the way people talked about products %HESITATION during the three years since Steve's passing yeah you know it's it's funny and I think it's %HESITATION sort of highlights the the the notion that you know the the train never keeps the nerve to the train never stops right doesn't matter who you are what you do and I think that's you know it was really evident at apple after Steve died that %HESITATION  nobody ever I mean there is an emotional break for people where that that that meant a lot and they questioned about you know what the what was gonna happen with the company %HESITATION but everybody just kept making the same thing they they kept making %HESITATION there is not really a change in either us or %HESITATION philosophy or anything like that %HESITATION you know there were some decisions that I think %HESITATION Steve had drawn a line in the sand about around the role of E. commerce and  are getting that we were able to challenge a little bit more after he wasn't there but the the day to day of of %HESITATION how apple operated as a design sort of a legacy of of a strong design culture and it was sort of built in %HESITATION  from day one I think %HESITATION release from the time I was there it never really change that much %HESITATION which you know isn't that interesting a story but it's actually kind of kind of a testament for them for the yeah the origination  at  and now the role of the designer and apple contrast to designers here at a bank and this could involve yeah process thing arms on  you know I think the day to day of what a product designer  does at apple and does it eBay at least in the groups that I was I was a part of with the commerce and and some extent and and marketing side of things wasn't terribly different %HESITATION you know I think the biggest differences are as going to a little bit before is %HESITATION that the the place the the the space that a designer occupied at at apple %HESITATION it was elevated right like design is it apple is a design company if your designer apple and if if you're a finance person at apple design is what is done there %HESITATION and so %HESITATION  no that's not necessary that wasn't the case at eBay and that's not a bad thing %HESITATION I think ninety nine percent of the start ups that happened in that era yeah design wasn't a thing and so %HESITATION there's a low like most companies there's a lot more %HESITATION work to be done to bring design to people for  within within the within the organization yeah if we if we just like climbed a little bit higher and I'm so that's the role of designers in the organization the role of E. commerce so yeah right eBay like that is the thing well yeah %HESITATION verses at apple right yeah so how they what were the what with the different ways that the apple approached E. commerce versus yeah you're doing  well I think to that very point it sort of taught at that that one point about %HESITATION you know at apple St %HESITATION ecommerce as just a sales channel right at eBay it's the channel yeah there's just one business that the brand and its E. commerce and it's a two sided marketplace and %HESITATION which is incredibly complex %HESITATION and so %HESITATION  at apple you ray because you were just a one of many sales channels any commerce you you could push the boundaries %HESITATION and not have a massive impact both in a good in a bad way %HESITATION at %HESITATION on the company right like you could you know switch out %HESITATION the website with the image map and probably still  so close to the same end of things because people just there yeah luxury items that people really want %HESITATION then at eBay %HESITATION and but there's a downside to that at apple's well because you wind up toiling around the edges and you don't really have that much of an impact and customers a lot of this trip %HESITATION and it's actually the probably the biggest thing that %HESITATION pulled me away from apple to eBay was this opportunity to impact an entire business %HESITATION and for designed to be one of the change agents to help bring about what a new a bank might be  %HESITATION so that to me that's like that's the the opportunity for impacted eBay I think for any designer is the thing that that gets a lot of people out about %HESITATION that you're impacting the entire business not just this little portion of it is pretty well known to about using data quite objectively to make decisions yes curious was that new when you came here is that because I think everything I've heard about how apple that's the yeah yeah so coming here that must have been some sort of a shock right yeah I mean you could so you could say that I mean I think %HESITATION if you were to try to quantify it %HESITATION you know apple is a relatively intuitive organization and sort of collectively intuitive %HESITATION operating off its own got %HESITATION and they do it  their way and they they make it work %HESITATION and eBay like most other companies %HESITATION utilizes data %HESITATION and it's actually not a bad thing it's a great thing like why wouldn't you want to have a day or so %HESITATION why wouldn't you want to have more ammo for understanding your customers are understanding opportunities and problems %HESITATION especially as a designer %HESITATION so yeah so it was it was a shock to the system but a very exciting shock to the system from A. like something that I felt was absolutely missing %HESITATION in previous experiences %HESITATION at apple was the idea that the customer actually be here %HESITATION then we can actually learn so but I find interesting this intuitive driven culture apple versus a data driven culture anyway %HESITATION going from one to one did you were there any elements of apple that you brought over yeah I think %HESITATION  one of the things that I think can can be the downside of of relying on on either one of those things completely is that you you are unable to make a decision when the thing isn't there so at at at eBay or fear of you for making a new product or a new experience and if there is no data how do you how can you know how do you actually know for making the right thing and if you if you only just rely on data to make judgments %HESITATION you that other part of your atrophy is right that other part of the of of your ability to make decisions after fees and that's what one of the things I observe when I got here and it what it wasn't  it wasn't %HESITATION  terrible in that sense but I what I saw was a lot of folks who which is a %HESITATION let's just see what the data says and and saying that about everything as opposed to saying about the things where it truly made an impact %HESITATION and so %HESITATION  we tried this we spend responded this amount of time my first year here trying to help  %HESITATION rationalize who when it was %HESITATION intuition kind of call versus the data kind of call %HESITATION and I think that that's that that team's appreciate that and that's that's something that I think is a designer you're always trying to balance those two things %HESITATION and I think even as a product ochre or engineering folks they would they would agree that like having some way to to balance those things would be really really good certain that balances K. %HESITATION what were some of the signals that you guys identify to decide between intuition verses data %HESITATION  you know I think %HESITATION  one is understanding what data is available %HESITATION and when it's available as it is  an important part %HESITATION than the kind of data right so if you have all quantitative data and no qualitative data you understand what happened but you don't understand why %HESITATION and if you all the have qualitative data you'll understand why we don't know what happened right it's hard because you don't have the amount of data that you need %HESITATION so one is just understanding the data %HESITATION understanding its relevance to the decision that's being made %HESITATION and then you know I think on the the other side of it is %HESITATION  when you get to that other side of of your intuition you know one of the sort of goofy questions that we would sort of %HESITATION  make sure we asked ourselves was %HESITATION do I love this thing like what I want to use this like do I care about this thing do I even care about this feature I think it's a good idea and if not  like in one of my doing what data might doing what what data my finding to help me make an art you know find an articulation of why I feel this way about this so that was %HESITATION we had a set of %HESITATION %HESITATION operational principles for the design group and and one of them was I love this thing and it was this sort of like checklist of things as a designer %HESITATION working on our teams that you know do you love it and if you do great if you don't like maybe you should now keep working on it %HESITATION keep iterating it's interesting since data doesn't have taste  now I haven't seen in a maybe it does maybe maybe we don't have to as a data has days but who knows yeah  I'd like to go back to the moment where you decided to come to eBay I was a big decision right you're leading a design yeah right yeah yeah well I mean I I think I'll be leaving the job is a life  the same last right into telling her he and and and you're you're leaving a design led company with a history of design into a company where  eBay needed you to bring your design sensibilities to work with the executive level so yeah %HESITATION and really help  bring eBay India design last company let yes right so that's a big decision yeah %HESITATION so that we you nervous when you when you first approach that opportunity did you think well yeah yeah I mean I think there is there is a bunch of parts to it I mean I think you sort of articulated both the %HESITATION and the part that would make you totally nervous and and and skeptical of it but it also illustrates the opportunity %HESITATION that's right the challenging after usually connected to each other if there was no way that a call yeah I totally and so and on a daily basis during the decision making process I would either error on one side or the other I just keep flipping and see which and when it ended up %HESITATION but I think that in this sort of goes back to something I was saying before about like %HESITATION won the opportunity to impact the entire company through design was a huge huge huge class %HESITATION it was %HESITATION at a scale that I haven't %HESITATION been out before you know going from %HESITATION leading a team of like fifteen or so people to a much larger team %HESITATION you know and and around a hundred or so %HESITATION big big change %HESITATION they got all the call that an order of magnitude that is that as a water magnet  and I think the other thing for me I think there are some cultural parts %HESITATION that I continue to weigh around %HESITATION transparency within the organization decision making within the or  and %HESITATION and then just as the again that opportunity to help transform a company right %HESITATION I tend to and most of my life have %HESITATION  I found myself gravitating towards the underdog %HESITATION and apple was a little bit anomaly in that sense %HESITATION and I think %HESITATION eBay is not the underdog by any stretch but I think %HESITATION very very successful business but the opportunity to help transform it and become a designed  you know I I a player on that list of of design led companies whispers huge %HESITATION and so you know %HESITATION  I think and then I think the last pit bet that flips the decision for me was around the company's purpose %HESITATION  know apple makes incredible products and that's really cool %HESITATION to be around but I think the thing that about eBay in terms of just what its impact on the world is it you know it's a it's a two sided market place that if you have an entrepreneurial bone in your body you can and you can sell things like you can find financial freedom yeah %HESITATION and that's an incredibly empowering them %HESITATION thing to wake up and think about every day %HESITATION and so for me %HESITATION  that was that was that was that was kind of the biggest thing I think at the end of the day and then the last bit is as a designer designing  a two sided market place is way more interesting and way more complex than like a traditional retail side %HESITATION so many more problems to solve  so  they're people listening with us right now who probably have  I probably have a very similar decision to make right they have career opportunities and they need to make a big decision about whether they should pursue something new or kind of stick in the role yeah %HESITATION that they're in now  %HESITATION on the one hand  you have to be patient right so yeah I'm I'm curious as to how much patience plays into that decision making process without being overly react they were just jumping at the next shiny object yeah I don't know %HESITATION I don't know if I'm necessarily refute classify as a patient person I don't know how qualified yeah I am to answer that what I  I I think it's you know everybody's balancing act is like %HESITATION  complacency verses %HESITATION you know just  anxiousness to go do something else right like how like how do you know if you're being complacent or if you're just happy yeah %HESITATION verses your restlessness is actually a sign that you should go or you should just your maybe not thinking about it right %HESITATION and so I think that those two things like in life were all sort of fighting that fight on a daily basis and I don't I don't know if %HESITATION turn of people's careers are any different than that and %HESITATION  you know I guess the the thing that I would say is like %HESITATION you know do you like the people that you're around you learning are you making things that you love do you believe in the place do you believe in the company %HESITATION and  what it how do you balance that against the opportunity like I don't know and you know maybe you just need to make a checklist and objectively put him down those the the two columns  %HESITATION but I I tend to gravitate towards those other things sort of like in life like are you getting what you need out of it I enter your is your impact measurable if that's something that matters to you %HESITATION out I just I wonder seniority plays a role in this though because  I put that kind of change doesn't happen overnight right so you can come the eBay and magically design became a thing like you right is working hard at it with the executives here and we'll get into that but %HESITATION you know these things tend to play out in chapters yeah yeah you kind of first need to start establishing some principles and ground ground work in frame a framework for non designers to understand the role of designed yeah you kinda work your way toward hopefully %HESITATION getting the kind of work that would lead to good design and then you hopefully get to a place where you ship good design right yeah %HESITATION  is there a way to like identify  where you are in that is probably not a linear map like where you are in so you've spent three for one year at a place and you're not happy baby unhappy because you probably stick it out just a little bit longer you things need to get kicked in again like I yeah how do you poke at that like figure that out  that's a great question %HESITATION I mean I think maybe part of it is %HESITATION  like what you see and what what what are the things that you're seeing that are leading you to believe that you're either being successful or not successful %HESITATION because often times in my experience anyway especially when you're talking about like change right %HESITATION change is really hard  means people have to do something differently and %HESITATION you know one of the things like thinking about %HESITATION just my time at at eBay like  urban moments where it feels like nothing's working %HESITATION  and big because you know I'm getting pushed back from people or are you but that's just people trying to rationalize something new in their lives right %HESITATION and so it's important to when you're looking at the things that seem like maybe they are going well you know it what it what it what is behind that with a layer behind that like %HESITATION is actually a sign of something good yeah right if people are actually rationalizing the change that means they're trying to understand and they're trying to they're trying to figure out how to use it or maybe rejected but they're actually  they're paying attention is right and %HESITATION I think we all have had experiences where you know the ultimate sign of failure is like just total apathy right there %HESITATION but he's even paying attention and %HESITATION maybe that's a sign right like maybe if there's just complete like disregard in every possible way for the thing that you're a waking up in the morning  %HESITATION you know maybe that's a sign that %HESITATION things are going the way there with the way you want them to %HESITATION but again it's you know if you just take a single a single data point and try to analyze that data point into a think about it over time  you can get in a bind something with everything we do  so we spoke about some of the questions you ask when you're deciding whether to leave %HESITATION but what are some that someone should be asking themselves when they're deciding where to go  %HESITATION well I think %HESITATION  there's a bunch of %HESITATION %HESITATION  I think the the the biggest one that I would say especially as you're getting a little bit  well no I think at any point your career like what kinds of problems that you're going to be solved yeah right like that was the that was for me %HESITATION leaving my designed comp that part company was a partner at to go to apple %HESITATION I went from solving like  he %HESITATION  in a pretty basic  design problems I've been selling for a long time to something totally new for me %HESITATION  %HESITATION that's a big deal and then going from apple to eBay I went from this notion of %HESITATION  polishing the edges of you know quote unquote diamond %HESITATION to like helping transform the company yeah so like I think thinking a lot about just the kind even if it's even if it's still you're still making things from job to job but like  what is the company do like what they stand for %HESITATION how many people make an impact there %HESITATION how are my decisions going to %HESITATION change people's lives %HESITATION or not change people's lives I think so for me I think those are that's probably the biggest thing is just like what kinds of problems do you want to solve %HESITATION  at the other one that's important for me and I I suspect for everybody else's like who the people are gonna be surrounded by on a daily basis like you like them would you go out to dinner with them like if you if you don't go out to dinner with them or hang out with them %HESITATION  is that you know that's that's a hard thing to do so it's my it's my own personal sort of %HESITATION  but I think it's a big part of just  how you're going to spend your time is and and who you're gonna spend your time with his like  sort of the fundamental question of life yeah without it sounds like you need to know where you want to grow  %HESITATION and you need to know who  what makes you happy yeah because it's your job to be happy rates cut your it's on you know it's going to do that for you and I think the other I I learned this %HESITATION awhile ago  using %HESITATION was  %HESITATION  everything changes %HESITATION and like %HESITATION  an inferior interviewed for a job a long time ago and %HESITATION you know I was an interview process as like a our director or something and I asked the question of like you know where do you see when you see this role being in two years and we see successes like that the quintessential be like I'm here to do the interview %HESITATION kind of question button that is like %HESITATION and the guy just looks I mean he's like  stay here because every single thing that we're talking about right now in six months is going to be totally different and so you need to make a decision about like this company and me is your boss and a couple of other things %HESITATION and  it's partially about what do you want to learn what's missing but it's also just about like truly  you're you're you're going to spend your time here with these people and %HESITATION I think that was like sage advice and I would I would absolutely I believe it one hundred percent %HESITATION everything's a  isn't it changes all the time and where you go in thinking and what you come out like literally in a couple weeks probably totally different authors options of the wrong and everything will change  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work  here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  of course we're inspired by our design program which is over sixty years old  today IBM employs more than one thousand three hundred professional designers and we've certified more than sixty thousand IBM verse in the practices of IBM design thinking  the result  divers teams working more closely than ever with our clients their users and our partners to create modern solutions  provide differentiated human centered outcomes to the world we'd love to share the story more closely with you  and I hope to see you soon at one of our IBM studios worldwide  I would also like to thank our friends and envision for their support invision is the world's leading product design platform powering the future of digital design through their deep understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One every Indy and that plugs let me tell you three reasons why I use it one poor communication is one of the biggest blockers for talented teams to we don't get  the back from others early and often you can get lost in the woods and that's just bad for everyone and three without a prototype it can be hard to show others your full vision for the sign invision solves all of that you can rapidly prototype at the front end of the design process and collaborate across every stage of the project it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers and developers and writers teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when they use envision sweet a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision apps are calm and use our access code I envy dash high resolution for three months free  today's take us through your first six months in the bay %HESITATION especially the things that you prioritized neon %HESITATION long time ago %HESITATION you know I think it's  a lot of it is something and everybody would do right like meet everybody just get to know every single person that was on the design team that for  and not just on the design team but my partners in the business product marketing all that kind of stuff %HESITATION and truly I try to understand like what matter to them and what the problems were %HESITATION and when you're in a company as big as eBay %HESITATION and that takes that takes like six months like it took a really long time even if I just broken down into ten minute intervals like was meeting with a couple other people trying to actually make sense of any of that well appointed you start actually doing the work %HESITATION I was the price of  it's not work  yeah well I think that's that's that's part of it right because %HESITATION I think what we all all learn as designers at some point is like you're wrong all the time like your assumptions are totally wrong and you know when I walked in here and took the job I had my assumptions as of like why isn't eBay shipping the products that we all think they should be shipping %HESITATION like is it a problem with design is a problem product is a part you know like all of those kinds of things and %HESITATION until you actually talk to people and listen to people and try to and spend sometime analyzing that like it's impossible to know right like %HESITATION there's been a lot a lot of time doing at a lot of time doing that %HESITATION  you know I had  we did actually ships and stuff beef in that six months that I was here %HESITATION thing that happened I was %HESITATION pretty fascinating was %HESITATION  we went through %HESITATION a couple of fire drills %HESITATION around from a technology standpoint that %HESITATION  dropped me in with a bunch of people that I had had never met before on like that you know serve crisis mode kind of  you know five days in a room together war room style %HESITATION and that was %HESITATION the best crash course in understanding this business that that I have in any of my experiences %HESITATION both building the bonds with the people that I now consider you know close our partners and friends %HESITATION but also just learning indeed  on the fly of like what it means to make decisions here %HESITATION and that was a that was a really %HESITATION unscripted and important thing I would I busted %HESITATION my bosses chops for a couple months after asking if that was just like a hazing like his I just what they do to everybody they just kind of with a fire drill and %HESITATION turns out it wasn't it was just that just me %HESITATION so %HESITATION you know back XO adds to sort of I think what it every designer does whatever you're trying to solve a problem right you  you know it's like design thinking one a one and you're trying to understand you're trying to %HESITATION make some informed decisions and then you're like I think that was my friend and I know that's pretty abstract %HESITATION but I think as I was learning the people learning the pain points learning what the opportunities where where we're being successful what success actually looked like I think that was kind of the biggest thing I sort of mention this before of like %HESITATION  everybody has their own version of what right is and spent a lot of time trying to understand that and then how that map back to the company like what the company saw is right ands trying to find a delta is in there %HESITATION and so that was a lot of the first six months there is organizational work that had to be done there is process work that had to be done %HESITATION  one and %HESITATION if you guys are interested in that kind of stuff around %HESITATION  one of the things that we that we instituted not long after I got here and it was %HESITATION  is an interesting it was a it was a interesting maneuver and potentially painful it was  very painful for the team here %HESITATION was we start instituting design reviews executive level design reviews %HESITATION and very single project that was going through some  %HESITATION and if you can imagine %HESITATION an entire product design tech organization that didn't have to do that before hand that now all the sudden had to go through this gate  yeah  the change looks different and are there a lot of people I can I'm here so the first one I actually felt like from here would you guys like to like it was that hazing for that designer like  right it was it was a pretty it was a pretty fast and you know it sort of goes back to %HESITATION talking about the question of who is actually where we identified the %HESITATION the question of do you love this thing yeah %HESITATION we're sitting in is our interview %HESITATION like second project to come through %HESITATION and %HESITATION you know designers presenting his work %HESITATION and he's like what worst body language I would just like crumbled over  just so bombed out about everything that they were presenting them and %HESITATION product manager sitting there right next to them engineering leads right next to them so it's like the whole teams presenting %HESITATION and so I at some point %HESITATION I pause and I was like so do you actually believe in this thing that you're presenting I do actually like this and  and you know he he looks over the product manager in primaries like  no I'm not used to like %HESITATION and he said I said no non and I thought that was like a really brave thing to do and it was like a  a really powerful thing for me to to learn of a like a powerful insights and to learn about like what was happening underneath %HESITATION  and you know at that I think the the thing is that in like next time we talk like  you should show what  you love I do the other thing to do the thing that somebody else thinks is writer that the the the that's been road map or prioritize but also make the thing that you think really does solve the problem for changes the problem %HESITATION and let's talk and we'll see which one attack %HESITATION we'll see which one the data proves out is is right around and will probably be right fifteen of the time but at least you know %HESITATION we have that and so %HESITATION it was really hard for the teams to go through that because adjustments this whole new process %HESITATION but it was really important for myself and for my boss to just %HESITATION understand all of the work that was happening I was like the first part of it was just for us to see every single feature product that was getting put out into the world %HESITATION and so you know we created a final where you know that with the final is hard because it's late actually slows down execution and slows down productivity %HESITATION but it was super helpful %HESITATION because we could learn and we could also %HESITATION help share out what we thought was important as well as it as it is like a design leadership team and help %HESITATION not to say that we are right but just the things that we thought were important %HESITATION because I that's begins like stand on stage and say that stuff but in the end the only really comes to life when you're down with somebody making those decisions together  before the final helps invest the other people in the day yeah as well right yeah it's a very abusive usable yeah transfer process yeah so we did that %HESITATION it's hard it's really hard for people %HESITATION but it was valuable I think most people would say that it was a valuable tool we have since been lack of let that relax a bit because we don't want to be a commander control company where absolutely trying to push as many decisions down into the teams as possible %HESITATION  %HESITATION but it was a valuable tool at that at that moment %HESITATION learned a lot from that just that one what what's different about so we got the picture of the year for six months here and what you prioritize then of course you understanding the world eBay was the most important thing back then %HESITATION what is it today what do you what do you days look like what do you %HESITATION focusing on  it's a great question %HESITATION  email %HESITATION  keynote %HESITATION  no %HESITATION I think I spent %HESITATION I I would say that I spend a lot of time %HESITATION on alignment %HESITATION that's probably one of the biggest things %HESITATION making sure that people %HESITATION on in the design organization understand the context for why are companies doing things %HESITATION  and why those why does that why we're doing this and why those things matter and why those why they're important to do %HESITATION and helping bring people along %HESITATION and then on the on the on the flip side is helping %HESITATION executive leadership of the company understand %HESITATION continued understand how design can play a big role in  continue to transform the company %HESITATION so a lot about it is is a around contacts around of it a lot of it is around alignment %HESITATION and and a lot of it is %HESITATION continuing to bring to light %HESITATION  the important role the design complain so it's even though it's three years and it's a  it's an everyday job job security man to have security there we go yeah now it's super important  %HESITATION  what are the decisions that the design organization I hear the vice president designed for email option right in what are the designs that your organization is responsible for the decisions that my organization is responsible for  %HESITATION  you know it's interesting %HESITATION  if I tried to pinpoint like the the actual decisions that the team is responsible for %HESITATION if I could I don't know if I could pinpoint that because I think it varies per team and I think it varies  in the moment %HESITATION you know I think people like the the pretty obvious answer is like the end and customer experience %HESITATION and %HESITATION how that all maps together yeah %HESITATION and how  %HESITATION  you know how we actually how we actually managed to create greater experience for people %HESITATION but I think I think it's just saying that design owns a decision I think it's actually a problem %HESITATION %HESITATION so  you know it's hard when when ownership is distributed right like when decision making is distributed it's can be very very hard %HESITATION but I think  one and when it's wife its design making decisions versus product making decisions verses engineering making decisions versus marketing making decisions  like when you get into a turf war %HESITATION and I think what what we try to spend our time focusing on is  making sure the team is accountable and and with that comes the decision making the decisions that go along with that so it if the scrum team is responsible for you know a user experience decision it's not just the designer being like what's my  I made the I'm the designer and so this color red is  I've chosen %HESITATION feel good again I in it is my decision and so you know like %HESITATION like those those days I think are gone %HESITATION you know I think there was a moment in time probably up until about ten years ago  %HESITATION design still was mostly rooted and %HESITATION graphic designer product design where you have like %HESITATION a designer it's about the designer right it's about the designer you hire to make the logo for you right like you hire Paul rand to make a palm and logo and there's no questioning that and it's just him and his way and that's it %HESITATION but you know creating %HESITATION interactive experiences is %HESITATION center on people it's not centered around it's not self centered its user centered right and I think  %HESITATION we went through this transformation I think problems like her ten or fifteen years ago but we never really reconciled it as it is what it means for a designer to add in for for myself like going I went through that transformation without even knowing it yeah %HESITATION but it is like if you're you know if you're sitting there just trying to own decisions as a designer %HESITATION especially in a product design organization %HESITATION and that's the thing that matters to you it's going to be hard it's gonna be it's gonna be hard because you just don't  system the way it's just not the way it works anymore and I don't think anyway %HESITATION and I think you know you can like  owned the you know how you organize your sketch files  that's super cool now there's like everybody everybody out there like list of things like I don't know that that now but like I think %HESITATION we're all better for it if if the teams responsible %HESITATION for the decisions out so when design is communicating its function to executives to see levels %HESITATION what should they be focusing on then is it implementation is a process outcomes money and this is tying back to the fact that the responsibility the product is owned between other roles as how to design  I think it varies I think it's going to vary from team to team from company to company culture the culture by I think it's so it's hard to just ten point exactly %HESITATION  what that means across companies and but I would say at eBay  like  for us it's about making sure the customer and  contact is represented that's like ballot like we have to balance the customer need an opportunity with what the business wants and needs %HESITATION and so for us that's a big part about it %HESITATION and it's you know I think you can probably try to get up to the three things and it's %HESITATION sort of how we look at it %HESITATION especially within our research organization you know what products remaking what products should we be making this what is the experience of that product and then what is the interface of that product %HESITATION how is it use and like I think if you sort of  view chunk those things out like that's probably a pretty good way to to think about it and it'll you know the presentation of the contacts will will vary depending on  you're talking about it but I think those are pretty good sort of  rex to to sort of look at things and to %HESITATION  and it's a it's a good way if you can build some vernacular along those lines across teams and across the exactly there should be a walk into a room and say okay we're talking about the interface today we're talking about the experience today we're talking about the the what the product is and you know conceptual eight %HESITATION it's it can be a valuable way to sort of articulate that and so that's I think that's  and it's again it's not the things that to just design presents its with the team presents and what's the team is is is is trying to push for what would you tell a business leader  that's on the fence about investing really investing in design  I like this mark  I would tell them  that  it's going to  take a long time for the change to happen and I would tell them that it's going to cost a lot of money out I'd tell them that it's the designers are a pain in the ****  and that they're gonna question everything  and I tell them  that we're gonna  blow stuff up  and we're gonna  we're gonna take a day of it out of out of your profits if and if they're still excited after I say all those things to them then I know that like were actually having a real conversation because they actually truly understand like how important is %HESITATION I'm not saying to go do that had  I don't know you know like say if that's not like Dave's foolproof checklist to like food you know and %HESITATION impress upon an executive the value of design but I think %HESITATION again it goes back to sort of  managing change right like that everything we're talking about is change and %HESITATION  it requires %HESITATION tenacity and it requires fortitude to to do it and if if you're just sort of like I don't know this design thing sounds like it's cool  maybe it's not right for you %HESITATION  %HESITATION I think it is right for you maybe you're just not ready for it yet need more and more %HESITATION  a better understanding of it %HESITATION I think the last part of it is  then I would impress upon something at right would be sort of looking out to see how an executive responds is  by investing in design  you're not investing in something else opportunity cost and so  what are you willing to give up what are you willing to do you prioritize so that design can actually happen here %HESITATION  and the good seo would say nothing because that's their job is to have cake and eat it  but it's the you know those are %HESITATION this important questions to get into because all they're all true like and we can sugarcoat it all we want to say like  but just wait until you see what you get at the end which is also %HESITATION a super important part of it but I think understanding that there are real trade offs %HESITATION to making something like this happen is a big deal  so assuming somehow someone talks to see %HESITATION when they drop all those things the sign is a pain in the **** to work with that thing in there without a profits all these things and somehow there's there's still room still listening crane from him %HESITATION and then from there they give you some free way to bring designed to this organization Marin %HESITATION three months down the line six months down the line like what should they be looking for to show that this is actually working graphite progresses down  I feel like we talked we talked a little bit before of %HESITATION  you know there's the outcomes right like the outcomes like great product experience great acts experience %HESITATION with you know everything up into the right is %HESITATION I think that's what everybody wants you know and and things of design as a silver bullet %HESITATION  and what I I think we were talking about before was like you know %HESITATION  are people actually engaging it is  their attention is their debate about the efficacy of of what we're doing if that's in there if that's happening that's like actually a good chunk of people actually try to rationalize it  I think you know a little bit further down the line  when other people outside of design talk about  the value of design you know you're on to something %HESITATION right when when you are not when people are doing your job for you you know that like your onto it %HESITATION when you have people and the product organization number saying this happens ever but if you had people on a product organization  bring up their head count for designers or giving their budget to design you know you're on to something %HESITATION you know that you're making traction within that within the company %HESITATION and those are you know  their their status to that right %HESITATION but I think it's you know you start to see how people accept things and then they start to make their own %HESITATION and we're having a lot like an eBay were having more success with that right now were a lot of the things that we've been piloting over the past six months are now being adopted by the product organization %HESITATION and part of the you know the initial response is okay that's our thing we we made that happen away man like  that means that if it matters so much to the organization that there were there willing to they want to take ownership of it and so for me like there's no better sign %HESITATION  of of of our success is when the rest of the company starts doing search thinking my designer starts doing like  Niners starts embracing it and taking ownership of that  close to this leads us to a series of questions that resource from our communities we reached out to a bunch of people in the community and we asked them you know what's kind of burning up in their mind at the moment we have a few days so we're gonna go candies with you now let's do this okay so  yes our first our first question is %HESITATION how do you explain the role of design to people at the bay  I've done it a lot %HESITATION  I think it varies depending on who you're talking to %HESITATION I think the role of design %HESITATION  as I see it right now is is again I sort of feel like a broken record is to like  bring the customer to life understand the opportunity as it relates to the customer and help actually manifest that that experience for them like that to me is kind of %HESITATION  a really important part of of everything that we do and that's the thing that we have to continue to push on and %HESITATION  you can't do wrong by bring the customer life  %HESITATION another question we have is how is the design organization %HESITATION structured a bank account  perfectly  %HESITATION  well the  %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION without like getting in front of a white board and drawing and organizational chart %HESITATION we are we're getting %HESITATION yes is  yeah %HESITATION so we're we're we're organized  around to sort of Maine %HESITATION areas and one is the work that we do like we have %HESITATION brand design team and we have a core product team and we have a %HESITATION new product design team %HESITATION and they're working on different channels basically %HESITATION  so they're organized by %HESITATION the part of the business a support and then we have then we organized by %HESITATION function right so we have researchers and writers and %HESITATION designers and programmers and operations people and so we're sort of organized around those two principles %HESITATION and the functions feed into into the work streams %HESITATION we set within the product design organization so I reported to the SVP of product %HESITATION and but we serve %HESITATION pretty broad set of company outside product as well  when you're the only designer in a business there people by the way listen of this that are in a start up or even hard company whether a team of two yeah %HESITATION  how do you explain the value of design to the non designers in the company  %HESITATION  thanks  I think that's a good that's a great question %HESITATION  I find that and it depends on what kind of design you're talking about are you talking about design thinking or you know because I'm the capital D. E. or you know the the activity of making  product %HESITATION that that once that's a hard one to if you're at that level where people are like well I might have an engineer friend who can just make that as I if you're out  that level then that's a  it is hard one %HESITATION I think what I found is %HESITATION explaining it to the people is the hardest thing to do and just doing it there is the best thing I ever gonna do a workshop tomorrow design thinking workshop and we're just  spend %HESITATION thirty seconds talking about what design thinking is and then just get into a workshop please %HESITATION and spend two hours with a bunch of like sea level folks  with me now they're gonna they're gonna be sitting there with aluminum foil and pipe cleaners and all this kind of fun stuff %HESITATION and  to me that that is the best way is to do it in practice and to  bring them all and make them part of the process as opposed to trying to articulate  in some well constructed you know theoretical %HESITATION dissertation %HESITATION about the value of design I think just get into it show than the value of it  another question we have is how do designers at eBay measure and present the results of this is coming from a place of you know designed for whatever reason being seen as abject did and that was not tangible yeah just putting it out there like a hoping for the best yeah %HESITATION well so it's it's in part of it is being you know sort of data driven %HESITATION and you know there's the  there is there some metrics out there that that are sort of tried and true like there's the AB test there is the the you know the sort of %HESITATION before after tests there is %HESITATION the qualitative feedback their survey feedback there's all these things that egg and then there's like an PS you know members girl the  things that I think are not necessarily design oriented but there are tools that designers can use to help articulate the success or failure of any particular decision  %HESITATION  the harder part is Matt measuring %HESITATION  the more fungible the more intangible %HESITATION components of of what a great user experiences right like how you measure delight right even to find a light %HESITATION they truly how do you do what what is the definition of customer delight and so these are the things that like I don't know how many organizations are many folks %HESITATION have actually solve that problem %HESITATION I'm hoping that somebody on one of the other podcasts can basically say here is all of the %HESITATION manageable here here's the here's the silver bullet %HESITATION we spend a lot of time %HESITATION working on that is one of our biggest initiatives as a design organization this year is figuring out a way to design to define and measure customer delight  %HESITATION  and %HESITATION happy report back once we get it %HESITATION yeah %HESITATION but it's hard it's really hard %HESITATION  so we'll finish with this last question as the function of design continues to evolve  what are the roles and methodologies that you think will emerge in the next five years now %HESITATION  I can speak you know I don't see the future but %HESITATION I can tell you just some of the some of the things that we're seeing and %HESITATION my new product development %HESITATION team were designing %HESITATION the buzz words conversational commerce %HESITATION which  is basically commerce in chat %HESITATION when we chat messenger Skype wherever %HESITATION  and %HESITATION for us I guess there's a there's a couple things that are really interesting about it %HESITATION  one it's based on artificial intelligence so designing for systems that will change over time based on user input dynamically that's not a terribly new thing but it's a thing that I think is really interesting in that space because the main interfaces conversation now %HESITATION so that's that's one I think just  %HESITATION the other part of that around conversational commerce is the main thing you're designing is conversation %HESITATION and wait and we you know we would launch a product that's inside of Facebook messenger it's called shop bought %HESITATION  and you know we spend a we spent a bunch of time trying to work out %HESITATION  how we can manipulate conversation to overcome some of the challenges with the interface %HESITATION and so I think what you'll see is the the the skill sets that designers have especially as things go %HESITATION this is interfaces become more ambient %HESITATION your inner voice are taxed or something besides the traditional interface that the skill sets that it is a designer require %HESITATION to have our far beyond %HESITATION than what we understand right now %HESITATION whether it's  you know being a great writer %HESITATION  %HESITATION being a philosopher like one of the things were designing where does  the identity of the spot  %HESITATION and so we have lots of philosophical conversations about not like the brand personality but like what is the personality  of this thing there is it human does it no it's no it's a robot if so is it doesn't understand it's kind of a big deal right now like you know like what and so you find yourself like stretching outside of your traditional boundaries of what being a designer does and I think as more of these kinds of experiences come to life the more and more %HESITATION  Amin experiences and artificial intelligence experiences come to life here to find yourself in this place where %HESITATION  making other things you're making you're making decisions design decisions so that other things can make decisions later and that is you know traditionally something that you know computer scientists at and I think that that's gonna happen more more for designers %HESITATION  I will retire by that  skip well yeah well thank you so much Dave thank you again  he made it to the end congratulations
