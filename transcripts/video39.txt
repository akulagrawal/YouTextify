YouTube the  Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of the one sheet I am Stuart Shuster this is Ben burns and that this is the show where we take our two interests of movies and design and we bring them together and we %HESITATION talk about movie posters  this episode is going to be about a movie that a lot of people love I love it  hello to  like seriously for a second there when I looked at your house like I don't even know if you  I could be wrong I don't know okay so anyway the movie is Jurassic Park nineteen ninety three dress apart was directed by Steven Spielberg and it stars Sam Neill Laura Dern Jeff Goldblum in one of his best roles the way way way before we do another one can I just %HESITATION  Richard Attenborough Joseph Mazzello Ariana Richards Samuel L. Jackson will go on to you but and way night you might be asking who's Wayne knight  me remind you hello  hello Gerry  %HESITATION  this poster has a little bit of a weird story because I I really did like a lot of research on this and I could not find a %HESITATION a designer for  poster it was an executive decision by Steven Spielberg that landed the logo on the film poster is the primary way of advertising not just the film but the inevitable merchandise that would follow dressing park is the story of a group of scientists who are invited to a mysterious island by a billionaire probably Jeff Bezos only to find out that the that that billionaire has been using his money to resurrect dinosaurs by harvesting their DNA from foster so  Ben burns  this is Jurassic Park I would love to hear your thoughts  I love this poster I I honestly don't see anything wrong with this poster I mean at compositionally it is so simple that when this was in theaters next to all the other early nineties flicks I think that this probably popped off of that wall just due to its sheer simplicity now compositionally what I think is is genius is the the use of symmetry a lot of designers and a lot of visual creators Hugh symmetry to communicate conflict so you'll notice like the scene where Darth Vader is walking up the stairwell in Star Wars is perfectly symmetrical and the reason why it causes conflict is because you're not really sure where you're I should line up because everything's so perfectly in the center and so I like it because it calls directly get up the hierarchy is so super clear on this you want to look at that logo all day long and everything else is secondary so I I'm just in love this I love this poster two and one of the that the I think  the main reason that I love it is because of its simplicity the fact that there is there's actually a number of alternate posters that you can if you look up online you can see these they're very standard like the faces of all the main characters war the big the big gates at the opening you know welcome to Jurassic Park or whatever but what I love that they did about this was they took  the simplicity of the logo which obviously if you've seen the movie is stamped on everything rain Jurassic Park lunch boxes tee shirts the jeeps that they drive around in its on banners hanging outside of the thing is everywhere the way that people advertise the park in the movie is the way that the movie is advertised E. and I think that's sort of like a flash of genius in a way I don't know that that's ever been done before no and actually this is actually the first time that the views this concept of meta branding where %HESITATION in the park in the film this was the parks logo and so a lot of times a lot of these films you'll see that the film has a logo but it's not represented in the content in the story line of the film and so this revolutionize that meta branding kind of concept and it was a genius play when it came to merge the Stephen you did good man did good but here's the kicker  I want to also talk about  the poster that they did for the twentieth anniversary rerelease because they went a completely different way with that okay so here we have the complete our  that way of going about that you still have the logo but you have the gate which we were talking about before you have the jeep you have you know the jungle outside in the background the light coming through the gates and this is very reminiscent of some of the alternate posters from the early nineties that they ended up not using for the original release and in a way like I personally feel like this is a much less effective poster or would have been a less effective poster for the movie at that time the just logo right well and there's some there's an obvious difference here if we put the side by side the original poster is obviously very symmetrical but what I like about it is you got this really strong red on black and that sets the tone for the movie right you have this kind of deep crimson that represents all this come out anger and blood in it juxtaposed on just a sheet of darkness just a just a campus a black AC this campus of unknown if you will Zach Lee right  so if you see this poster you guys are driving into the park and the park is like a beacon of light and said it's just because it's like a weird like what is this like what will that mean are we driving into the future we walking into the light it's sort of like a dissonance yeah thing yeah yeah not to mention the really corny three D. extra type at the top and me come on really  one thing I found out about in my research %HESITATION which I found really interesting I'm just going to throw this in here when they were designing the logo for it they  Lee %HESITATION made the palm trees at the bottom very small to emphasize the size of the T. rex gives a little context yeah right that that's that that's a hierarchy that we keep talking about %HESITATION I think it's fascinating if we go back to the old one Jurassic Park the original revolutionized the use of CG in a in a feature film  you don't see that on the poster  they've chosen to stay simple and I think that that restraint see it it just speaks volumes so it's very super impressive that they're not gonna lean into the special fax even though they're amazing they're gonna stick to what matters and that's the story story the park the story the brand yeah in the March  yeah they they have they have created something that it has become iconic Jurassic Park on black that's it you know that's all you need and I mean I honestly like I feel like this is one of those things where it's like there's there's like that one dude in the conference room who's like put it on black we're done  weekend everybody  either that or they walk in and and all that is is a is a look the logo on a dark slide and they're like well I like that and the designer sitting there like I haven't even started the presentation but cool yeah this is it  I have that idea  so that is all about this poster in the movie Jurassic Park now it's time for did you know Stewart  alright here's a couple of  axe about Jurassic Park the man out of them  the two in this is the best one the T. rex %HESITATION would occasionally malfunction during the rain causing it to turn on by itself and scare the people around it  well that was actually me any longer when I was when I was looking at  my god another little facts about the T. rex the T. rex's scream is actually combination of dog pain when tiger alligator in elephant sounds  whoa  the glass of water that signifies the arrival of the T. rex by its rippling actually had a guitar string under the glass and wind plucked would make the water ripple  director Steven Spielberg started on Schindler's list right after principal photography on Jurassic Park finished which meant that he was pulling double duty editing Jurassic Park while shooting Schindler's list after he finishes Schindler's list and Jurassic Park he took a four year break which was unprecedented for him  here's one of my favorites well interesting tidbit Sean Connery was actually originally offered the role of John Hammond and Jim Carey was originally offered the role of Ian Malcolm can you imagine Jim Carey is Ian Malcolm now  no  no no love you Jim but  %HESITATION did your bottom  now it's time for a knowledge check  the words Jurassic Park in the original logo  are they custom or are they established typeface let us know in the comments below
