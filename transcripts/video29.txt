he was losing my name's Bobby go shop and I'm jade around we're sitting down with twenty five masters of the design industry you've been sitting with us every single week for the past few weeks you've been following us all over the country we did a little road trip from New York right now in Boston or meeting with someone from today who were meeting with %HESITATION speaking with the founder of U. I. E. and center center this year at school he's gonna talk about you what's designs recent coming of age the role design plays in a business and starting yet another design school give us a second stick around it's going to be worth it right after this partner message  this is Chris me through this important what do you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move with squarespace visit squarespace dot com and enter the code high resolution one word for ten percent off your first purchase  thanks for joining us  thanks for having me awesome what's the one thing about the design that's clear to you that you don't think it's clear to other people  %HESITATION  I think it depends who the other people are but %HESITATION I think the the big thing is is that people think design is about and and process that's about you know producing a thing producing  a service when design is really about solving problems and it's really about %HESITATION  understanding what those problems are and that any solution any artifact any %HESITATION production is just an attempt  at understanding the problem better  and once you sort of see design as  robin solving it is a %HESITATION a very different ballgame and you know it's one of those phrases that people use as lip service you know we're here to solve problems but the  what they mean is we're here to produce Aleutians I think what a lot of people don't see is that it's really about you know we're here to really understand why the problem is a problem  and once we understand why the problems problem any number of solutions will get us to a better place  I think design also does a good job using its process to find problems because once you have a problem I understand diving into why that's a problem but there's also the problem of not knowing what the problem is higher yeah so design doesn't understand problems because design is just a notion it's not it's not a thinking thing yeah %HESITATION people understand problems and people understand problems Best Buy using design practice but not all design practices will get you to understand the problem so you need a set of design practices that really help you understand the problem and so the active designing for a %HESITATION sophisticated designer is really  understanding how you're going to get to that place  as a high  are you how are you going to start taking apart the problems %HESITATION  that  that you're you're working towards and really get to address a solid understanding of of what it is that  makes the world a better place it you you recently I read your blog and I you recently wrote a very interesting article called why I can't convince executives to invest in U. acts now have you can't convince exactly as the rescue X. there's no hope for the rest of us up I want you to assume for a second that you're sitting you probably done this a thousand times before but let's try on camera this time you're sitting across from executives that are willing to listen and they are objectively paying attention to what you're saying and they want to invest in new X. how would you convince them to  to just push the needle and hit the button and say yes like this is this is something that that you must do all adds easy what problem are we trying to solve %HESITATION let's say let's let's actually call it a no that's the question I mean that's how I do it all I see  Hey is you just say what problem are we trying to solve right what is it that we need you know the question I often use is let's say that let's say by some wacky chance this thing you want to do that actually works and we make the thing that you want us to make and it's a success in the world how's the world different  right what what is actually the difference in the world because we did this thing  and  often that is like what the first reaction as well because it will be all be richer like okay that's not that's a that's a difference for you that's not a difference for everybody what what is it that actually makes the world better because we've done this thing  and that's  that's a starting point for for having the conversation is to understand what that end goal is and that turns out to be one of the hardest things for people to get to is is to sort of say okay were  we know we have to produce this thing we're gonna produce this new version of our product and it's going to go out and okay great  five years later what's different because we did that how has the world changed because we did that and if we can get to that conversation as to how the world has changed then suddenly we now okay is this the tool to get us there or some other things to us there once we're done with this what's the next step after that what's the next step after that right and now we're on this trajectory to get to that thing five years from now that that this short term project is just a baby step for  and that that's the that's the key pieces to is to is to get to that vision of what what the experience will be like five years from now so it's thinking about the outcome before you make any yeah it's it's it's it's there's an old phrase of of starting with the end in mind right understanding why we're doing what we're doing are we all on the same page you know let's say we're going to produce a new watch thing okay so this is a new watch  why right what is it  that will change five years after we've produced this watch such everybody's got them what are they doing now differently how is that changing their life  and  probably one of the problems that we have with you know the apple watch is no one can answer that question is that right what is different about it if you look at two thousand seven when the iPhone came out and you look at two thousand twelve when everybody had smartphone type products suddenly we have this this vast difference in  what the technology can do and what people are doing in it and it's as not all what we thought that I phone was because member the first iPhone didn't have apps right the first iPhone %HESITATION couldn't stand %HESITATION pictures with taxed whether one have be a platform where people are making short films on L.  I didn't have a video capability did you know there are lots of things that I phone could do at that moment five years later it's a bigger deal ten years later it's you know an accepted thing in the universe that the the how did we get to that point what makes a difference in how is your product or service going to be  %HESITATION better %HESITATION how's it going to to change the world that way and what is it going to do even if what you're making is something that you know just a tool that teachers use in the classroom how is education going to change because you produce the store the classroom you're making something for  %HESITATION sales people to sell better how how is it that the customer sales person relationship changes because you've built this thing and and and those are the questions that you want to get to and so when we're talking about you know how do you convince executives to invest in designing what you really want to do is get them to start talking about how are you changing the world what is it that you're trying to do here and then back into the fact that the only way they're going to get there is through well designed product but that's that's sort of secondary to that the thing why the why is yeah  yes how specific they should be getting in that answer like is this  you know the  you can run the risk of if it's too specific you kind of back yourself into a corner and there is a direction that the business will never go because that is the route that is going to be the %HESITATION the the the box that you have to check every time you make a product decision right but if you make it too vague then you can do anything and might actually lose product vision focus specificity doesn't back you into a corner %HESITATION %HESITATION stubbornness backs into your order right not saying %HESITATION that's better than what we were thinking let's go with that right  that's what you used to avoid backing into a corner specificity actually helps if you can describe that experience in detail people can start to take a part pieces of it they can start to say %HESITATION in order to accomplish that piece I need to build this infrastructure right and  that that's great %HESITATION add  thank you for the way to think about a vision is it's basically %HESITATION flag in the same  %HESITATION it's a giant flag on it post that's in the sand far away so far away that we can't get there tomorrow we can't get there the next week it's gonna take us years to be able to get there but we can see it it's this nice big flags flapping in the wings not only can I see it but you can see it and I probably just went because sunk on your microphone  not only can I see it but you can see it and %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION Jerry can see it everybody can see it and the %HESITATION the beauty of this this flag is it's in the sand so if the market changes if the if the customer's changer for competitor comes out with something that that that chefs in the world right we can pick it up and we can put in the sand someplace else and think it's as long as we can each see it there the standing orders are March towards the flag and if we pick it up and move it it's still March towards the flag it just means we have to be a good at communicating Hey the flags moved it's now over here it's not over there but it's still inside I'm still marching towards it and even if we start in different places  working virgin  so when you talk to executives what you really want to figure out is where stuff AG what is the flag where is it and how do we make it is visible as possible and if we can make it is visible as possible we don't have to worry about it moving  we just have to worry about making sure that  everybody's clear  take a baby step towards the flag take a baby step towards the flag just keep doing that over and over again eventually hit the flag if you look at the the last three years and is starting to become a little bit clear the companies are going through a sort of a coming of age in the design function anyway do you think that do you think that businesses need to go through a set of levels forward to to reach you X. maturity %HESITATION like how can a business pinpoint where they are and you X. majority  at  U. X. maturity is %HESITATION you X. design maturity is I think a better phrase %HESITATION is a  it is something that that has to do with understanding  how the design elements  actually play into the success of your products and services right so organization source start at this stage that that we call %HESITATION the dark ages where they don't even know that  there is a design thing there is a U. acts thing and they're all they're about is just getting the product out the door technically and making sure that you know it does with the business needs it to do so there whatever design  emerges as what design you have right and and every product has a design it's just sometimes it's not an intentional design and so no one's thought about the design it just comes out and of course it's probably not usable it's probably not out yet but in some cases people love it the customer  as well but because they %HESITATION it does something that nothing else does you know I can I can now yeah the first the first X. ray machine was an incredibly hard to use but it was a great actually machine because you could see things under the skin that you couldn't see otherwise and suddenly you can make diagnoses you can make before so so this was something that you had to be a trained professional to operate in order to to to use it and use it safely but the the user experience of it was horrible right and every every product every service score goes to that stage and companies go through that stage to where they should be out there so focused on just existing with they just get it out there and then %HESITATION within organizations often what happens is %HESITATION leader within the organization says you know we could do a little better with the medicine they they they create something with their team that is a better designed things right and the organization gets excited about this in many cases and and in some cases will can try to get them to continue but an organization it's not set up for design usually the weight of the rescue organization pushes back on on that thing and it dies off right and so we call that spot you acts decide where you know if you were if you were to take in a large organization if you were to take some sort of %HESITATION fMRI like mapping of of this organization you would see good design pop up here and then burned out good design pop up there and bring out it was just you sorties little sparks of design that would show up in the organization but then  the organization brings it out the next stage  is when someone says you know what this design stuff is actually makes sense for us we need to invest in it so suddenly of a executive investing in this and they hired design manager in the design manager bill to design team and that team serves the organization and so that's what we call design is a service of that sort of the next stage in and design is a service you go out and you are  looking at  %HESITATION %HESITATION finding the the different %HESITATION %HESITATION opportunities that design can improve the product or service and you go in and you do design things and and sure enough the out the team is willing you get them to produce something that's better %HESITATION and a lot of organizations think that's that's the ultimate right we're going to build this design team and once the design teams in place they'll they'll have their seat at the table and they can they can make design happen everywhere  but that's not the older there's another point which is if you do that really well  one team in two teams and three teams start to realize that they actually need design more permanently than just going to the service organization and hiring their designers right before the release %HESITATION right the beginning or whatever wherever they tend to insert themselves and that they need a designer that's going to think about multiple releases at a time and they need designers that are always on the project to handle any question that comes up and work side by side with the developers and product managers in the other people on the team so now you're in  this position where %HESITATION design is now a function of %HESITATION being indicted on the team so we call that embedded you axes are island and they are they are full time there %HESITATION and summaries Asians are there and they think all that's the ultimate but it turns out that that it's not what we found is is that their team to go beyond that and the teams that go beyond that  people who  a conventional way have not been referred to as designers product managers developers other people on the team start to make design decisions turns out they've always been making design decisions but now they actually understand the difference between making those design decisions well and making them poor way and they start to actually make better design decisions and they actually can handle me  most of the small design questions that come up they could handle without a official designer getting involved and suddenly you're out what we call in fuse design right where everybody on the team is infused with understanding what design is and that's the ultimate stage as far as we know that's the point where if you had everybody in the organization you know including the accounting department in the legal department if they all understood the difference we good design about design and they understood where design plays out suddenly %HESITATION arrives the decisions they make you know when when compliance says you have to present these disclosures on the screen to make sure our customers are aware of the regulatory  strange that we work under they can put those up in a way that %HESITATION hate in order for us to do the job for you here's a little thing you need to know are you cool with that sure check the box okay we're ready to get going right suddenly they can make a good design decision and no longer you must agree to the terms and conditions that we not going to actually show you  right yeah how old I'm curious what  what is the designer or a design team in a company doing to get from the embedded design phase to be infused  how much time you have %HESITATION  %HESITATION what they're doing is  they are  primarily for  %HESITATION I'd actually there educating right the problem initially as a as a literacy problem  most the time what prevents organizations from producing good design is they don't they have key individuals who don't know the difference between good design and poor design so they're just putting stuff out  an eight day as far as I know it's as good as anything else since they don't know what the difference is they can't tell that the thing they produced wasn't good it seems like it is what's the difference and so then you're in this constant battle of saying now that thing you just produced that was crap you have to let us but they can't see the difference so you stay put them side by side this I understand yeah right right yeah so so so now so a lot of what design teams do is design literacy  and design literacy as  here is why this design is a good design and here's why this design isn't a good design and we can start to walk through and break it down into its components of of why it's you know you you you measure design on a scale of frustration to delight so why is this one more frustrating in this one's more delightful right the fact that that this one is more frustrating this one's more delightful is a huge awareness for some people right that they don't realize that you could have these two designs and one is more frustrating than the other and they think the thank you oftentimes because what makes something frustrating because you don't know how to use it but when you've designed it yourself you obviously know how to use it so it's not frustrating to you particularly if you just designed it but never used it so it's definitely there's been no frustration in that process so %HESITATION that means that you are in this situation where as far as you're concerned there's no frustration there so it can't be a bad design right and they don't realize that that when you put it in front of somebody else they're gonna exhibit frustration and then it's like okay how do I fix that I don't know so so that's a lot of what those folks do at least in the early days is deal with that and then after you have sort of gotten past literacy that have to work on fluency right and fluency is is basically can I predicted Billy produce good design  you think about becoming fluent in the language and that really means can I actually string a bunch of words together in a sentence that sounds like someone who normally speaks that language and %HESITATION are the same as  German design can I've consistently produce good design that's fluency and that just comes with practice and and the ability to tell the difference we good or bad design so I put something out I tell books that wasn't good when we tried again you know oftentimes we start with recipes here's the formula for producing the S. and then you you do that and I get you to be able to do a small set of things very well you know it's like learning to cook and I can you know once I were in a recipe I can make that thing over and over again I can't make something slightly different format but I can make that thing over and over again as long as I have all the pieces but then you become when you become fluent you can actually start to switch the pieces you can start to say all I can take that from over here and that that becomes mastery right so that so mastery is the last in Chicago literacy fluency mastery and  %HESITATION  this what teams are doing is they're working first on literacy and then I'll fluency and once you get everybody to fluent you're in that situation  when you think of a world in which businesses are designed fluent and maybe design masters right just generally in the business world %HESITATION we have these infused teams and everyone's applying the tools of design this design of that point become commoditized you think %HESITATION much like say out  but you don't need a telephone operator today right %HESITATION and and you you don't you don't need a %HESITATION some of the the type might work process for you because you just have access to the tools and the knowledge of how to do it yourself %HESITATION but what is what is the world design of this world  yeah I mean I think I think  are %HESITATION  designers  morph into something different than they are today but that's okay we ensure signers today or something way different than they were five years ago or ten years ago so %HESITATION they are they are very different I think  I think for designers to go away completely we have to solve all of the world's problems so I'm assuming that's going to be awhile yet and so we're probably not going to be without designers for that interval because as long as their problems to solve I've but the thing is is that designers are solving way bigger problems than than they are  then they will be now just like designers today  when I started in the design space I was working with hot lead so I was I was working in newspapers and we were setting newspapers with with these machines that would make wed in real time  and I didn't have to deal with the idea that I actually if I needed an easy and there were no easing the type case I'd have to go car of one %HESITATION I could use the lad that was out of the machine and I can just put it in and there was a there was a way for me to create a new easy in the type face that I needed %HESITATION by just loading the right cartridge and so %HESITATION I I  I didn't have to deal with the problem that designers before me had to deal with right and nobody today has to deal with hot lad right everybody  today they want any they type any in them and the face magically appears they don't go reaching into a tight case they don't go making type their their %HESITATION their creating %HESITATION  they're creating this in %HESITATION  in real time and it's just happening and so so design is always changing and anyone who sort of worries about design changing out from under them just  has and have the right education to the nature of problems change the role of designers assimilate into whatever the new brave world is that we yeah I mean every time we solve a problem we create a whole bunch  every time we see %HESITATION %HESITATION learn about a problem we realize that the problem is on multiple levels so we can solve it on one level but it will still exist on a bigger level and so the the  by the way we think about problems all in just changes but but the the the problems will be there  %HESITATION still need to communicate people still miss communicate those are huge problems right how do we make it so that  now take a problem happens every all the time like every day now someone type something into Twitter asking what they think is a reasonable question someone else takes offense at that they reply with something snarky now you've got this Twitter thing happening right how could we could how could we have prevented that  what could what  what way could we prevent that now what is the best way because if those same two people were sitting at the table across from each other that conversation would not have happened that way so why is it that that people who get along miss understand each other and then you know hell breaks loose on the Twitter right how do we how how would we solve that problem and and that's not a problem of Twitter not working that's a problem of people not communicating and people haven't communicated for years that's how wars have started and it's still how wars have started and now we have a president who's going to start a war over Twitter and and all of that is is %HESITATION bound to happen %HESITATION and all I can say is sad  but the but the fact is is that that's a problem it's an it's a solvable problem though I have no clue how to solve  so there seems to be a lot of  I love it's confusion or uncertainty just around hiring designers today right %HESITATION and that may be for a number of reasons and maybe it's just a skill set that wasn't hot people %HESITATION maybe could be the job descriptions that are just setting up the wrong expectations from day one I'm but I'm curious how you think people in organizations should talk to designers %HESITATION and make sure that they hire the right ones for their their businesses needs  yes %HESITATION so if you want to build a great design team you have to hire great designers I mean there's no there's no way around that you can't you can't build a great design team without that so the the problem is is that the way we have  %HESITATION  learn how to hire designers  has been this  really poor process and it's just by copying what we see other people do and slightly modifying it think we're somehow improving it as this this evolutionary game of telephone and what we have today is this this mass of the hiring process in most organizations that have no clue how to hire how to even begin to hire people so we've been  we've been doing a lot of work on helping teams  learn a better hiring process and %HESITATION the process that we've adopted is a process that  is very thoughtful very intentional %HESITATION it's called performance based hiring it was invented by a dude named a lewd Lou Adler %HESITATION  and lose idea  is that you can you focus on  what you want the person to do very specifically that's really interesting so in most organizations that we go into they have a position called designer and they create a single job description for designer and then every designer they hire they hire to that job description of thing and and or maybe they've they've gone so far as to break it up and I'll have an information architect and a user researcher and the user research will have one job description information architect love a different job description and and they'll they'll just map to those job descriptions and and with the job descriptions are are vague and they're all based on must have three to five years of experience doing information are  whatever whatever it is and of course  someone who has  someone who has ten years of experience could either have this intense ten year experience where you can see their growth or they could have spent ten years at a job and done the exact same thing every year so it's basically one year of experience repeated ten times and there's no growth and what what you want what most hiring managers want is they want someone who has grown because they're gonna need to come into this position and grow when they're in need so what you want to do is you want to look at comparable experiences of what we do is we  work with teams and we focus on okay for gonna hire these people let's talk about what we want them to do so the assignment that I give teams to start with is a process where the first thing you do before you write the job description before you've written a job ad before you do anything is you right as a team you write and agree on a thank you letter and the thank you letter is a note in the future usually one year after the person is hired  to that person now we don't have a person yeah we don't know who they are but we're writing a note to that person thanking them for their first year and in detail spelling out all the amazing things they did over that year thank you so much for the incredible year you have changed our organization the first thing you did was you came in and you sat down and you did an inventory of everything that %HESITATION we've designed so far you came up with the basics of our %HESITATION design  system and then you worked with the development team to build out the design system and you got a pilot going with %HESITATION onboarding team and they built their first tool with the design system you go through a new list out every thing with that person did beat and you get everybody agreement and what happens is teams look at this I go really I didn't figures no work on onboarding why would you want morning and we have this conversation with the team and suddenly we're talking about what will this person do when they get here and as soon as we have agreement on that now we can ask the question what do we need them to already know day one to be able to pull that off and that's what we hire for and then if we're having someone come in a designer designed system do we want someone who's actually designed to design system before or do we want someone who's going to learn how to design a design system either answers okay but we need to answer that before the first interview happens in fact before we write the job bad because the job I need to say we want you to come in and learn how to  the design system or we want you come in and create a design system that is better than all the ones you've created in the past right we want we're gonna create the ads that way and what you end up with is you end up with job ads that are  very specific so specific to what that position about because I'm not gonna hire for designers that are going to design systems are higher one right and so they're very specific to that that someone's going go check my dream job and that everything I've done in my career has been leading up to this job right and they can talk to that it's going to change the way you interview because if you know your hiring someone who has to be able to complete a design system in  first year you're gonna look for the things that they've done in the past that do that and what it does is it shifts the the the key to performance based hiring is that it shifts the arm hiring process from what we call %HESITATION  %HESITATION what we call it  my brain my vocabulary server just crashed  it shifts the hiring process from what we call gladiator voting which is thumbs up thumbs down you know love them Killam right to an evidence based thing it's like %HESITATION I have evidence that he that this cat it she has created five design systems her first one was a very good and she improved it this way and that you got it better the next time in the fifth one was amazing and she's going to come in here she's excited about our challenges because we can talk to how ours are similar to what she's done before but not quite and she's really excited about that so I can get her excited about the position and the same time I can get excited about her work because I can see this path of her being able to handle the scale of our system because it's larger than anything she's ever done before and that's really key because so often will will get somebody and say well we need you to design system ever known yep okay cool has done a design system but we don't realize that they did one that had five elements in it and we need one that's going to go across seven thousand apps and have a thousand elements in it and they have no idea how to handle that kind of scale yeah right and it isn't until we have those conversations that we do and the thing is that you have all these conversations before the first interview yeah almost always in the teams that I go into who have not  I thought about their interview process if they have these conversations at all it's after they've interviewed the Canada and one person interview the candidate for someone who's gonna create design system and somebody else interview the candid for completely different issue because I didn't know we were working on design system  and  and suddenly we realize we've got completely different people who have the same design title but we're interviewing them completely different way and what I'm saying I think they're perfectly %HESITATION Mrs I'm to get qualified at all and we and we're now having a conversation with the clock ticking waiting for this offer to go out and this person is like I'm going to

of three amazing guests that were speaking to that are doing something pretty amazing your bill there's  I'm one of three one of three but I I you're building your own design school I am and I want to talk about that its call center center he %HESITATION two spellings to use to to to spell two different ways center yes L. C. N. T. E. R. C. E. N. T. R. E. that's right %HESITATION  what did you see in the existing design school market %HESITATION where you saw differ  since he and said this is something that you needed to do because this is no small feat neared you've been doing this for a long time five five years we've been working on this for project for five years right %HESITATION yes so the the way the project started at %HESITATION  my co founder %HESITATION Leslie Jensen in men and I %HESITATION started started the project separately %HESITATION unbeknownst to each other %HESITATION  I was dealing with the fact that the company is  the companies that we were surveying %HESITATION word struggling finding design talent  they were we were spending a lot of time helping to bring people in and helping them build their skills up from within but %HESITATION the time which is was now there's were not enough designers and design was was five years ago starting to get real traction apple had sort of made the case for everybody that if you design things well you'll sell more at a higher price and suddenly everybody wanted to be apple and and and all the sudden %HESITATION design is now this bigger brighter things so everybody everybody need young get me some of them designers and and we're getting tons of calls and there were there were just not enough and  so  I was at dinner with %HESITATION one of the people who invented the web %HESITATION %HESITATION there's really no other way to describe her %HESITATION Molly whole swag she she was one of the world's first %HESITATION serious web design  honor she defined what people use on the web and we're having dinner in Chinatown in Boston I remember like it was yesterday and  and I'm saying you know we gotta get design we gotta get schools to produce more designers and she said well you just should Starscream's that was the stupidest idea I'd ever heard and it %HESITATION  %HESITATION in the mean time %HESITATION it wouldn't leave right that idea just wouldn't leave and I start talking around and sharing it with friends and %HESITATION they said yeah I know this is exactly right you have to go do this and  my co founders at the same time she was thinking about this from the education perspective she'd been teaching design  at the university of Tennessee and she was getting her %HESITATION doctorate in education and her dissertation was on how do we create a better design  program that actually serves industry batter and she was working on it from the perspective that schools were not producing people the way that %HESITATION folks needed and so %HESITATION a friend of mine said have you talked to Leslie I'd known Leslie for a long time but I didn't know what she'd been doing it at university of Tennessee and  our show all right I know but I I will in and and didn't think much about it in a couple days later Leslie tweets %HESITATION I've decided to resign from UTC to take on a new project I don't know what my wife is going to be like from this point on but  I'm I'm ready for the new adventure and so I'd I'd sent back at a center DM saying Hey we need to talk  and within hours we were talking about this school idea and she's like yes we need to do  and  %HESITATION  so so that's where it started and then the first thing we did because  understanding the problem is the thing I do is I want understand well why aren't schools producing students so firstly is we went and talked to hiring managers and we talked to hundreds of hiring managers and what we ended up talking about was why why why do you look for in people and this is how I found out that the hiring processes were all broken but not only you know how do you hire people and what do you look for but ya have you hired students and what what's what's going on with that how's that work out what's worked well and what's been disappointing and what we found was uniformly hiring managers were disappointed with students to the point where %HESITATION many of them had given up bringing in students at all day would they want people with a certain amount of experience because  as they were tired of of students who come in without having the skills necessary and so the thing was no one was feeding this information back to the schools and so we we said well there's an opportunity here so we decided yeah it's great the school and what's what's make the students industry ready so that's that's what we're doing is creating students who can on day one be you  for parts of their team and to do that we had to take apart  the way education is done because we operate outside the normal university structure we don't have to be bound by a lot of the constraints that universities are bound by their all these constraints that have to do with accreditation and and structure that that when we were designing our curriculum we were able to say let's put that aside for now we'll come back to it if it turns out it adds value but let's start with this idea of our goal is the end goal which is how to create someone who's industry ready and for that we came up with this two year program that is sixty six percent experience based it sixty six percent of time students are working on projects so in essence you get a year and a half's worth of experience by just going to school and you work on long projects they are  three to five months in length they start with an assignment with what the project is an a and with deployment and post deployment evaluation so students actually ship things which is not done in most designed schools and they %HESITATION they go through all the processes they go through all the elements so it's not just having to create a great design for this idea I had and I'm going to pass it in yeah  in today's design schools  %HESITATION if you are in a student  your experience  is often %HESITATION  I'm going to %HESITATION  hi I'm gonna create this design I'm gonna handed in  you are going to to as my teacher you're gonna give me an examination maybe %HESITATION right in the margins one or two little things I could have done better but because I was a student it's pretty much perfect so you're just going to hand it back to me and that's the only do that over and over again inside classes so if I take twenty five classes I'm gonna do that twenty five times get twenty five days get twenty five things back with virtually no comments on them and I'm going to think I'm a pretty awesome designer and then you're going to a workplace and I'm gonna hand something in that's a brilliant idea and the developers you're gonna say yeah there no way we can implement back to bite them and  the the the students like but I this is a work you don't understand you are you how come you don't understand what a work is I know this is a work of all we got names right and  we don't want our students to graduate with that attitude so our students actually have to build the stuff and they have to give them to developers and developers gonna say I can't build that they're going to say  okay tell me what to do and and they're going to learn right and they're going to learn how to be functional  entire program that's built that way so you spoke about getting your students industry ready right %HESITATION what are the skills that you're committed to teaching them in this class and the school  all of them  what are all %HESITATION %HESITATION we are  %HESITATION we're focused both on sort of the technical skills so they're gonna learn  how to god  how to create designs %HESITATION already so we're five months and and %HESITATION I took I taught the interview axe course and they they suffered through that for a few moments and then %HESITATION which basically just are introduced with the two years of the program are going to be like %HESITATION and then  they started with sketching or prototyping so they spent three weeks on sketching prototyping then they spent three weeks on information architecture then they sent three weeks on  %HESITATION user research practices and then three weeks %HESITATION front end development  and next one is critique and design studio then they're gonna spend three weeks on copying content strategy then they're gonna spend three weeks on %HESITATION scenarios and storytelling and then three weeks on interaction design and three weeks on visual design and we're going to keep doing that thirty times and so we it's a it's a  it's a combination of of sort of hard design skills so interaction design visual design %HESITATION copying content and soft skills like critique and presenting and sketching and the idea is that  the students learn a mixture of how to work in a workplace they'll learn their learning how to formulate emails their warning how to reflect on their work they're learning how to work in teams and collaborate %HESITATION all the things that that actually  a lot of  of  schools don't teach right L.  most schools when they do group projects they have three people work together on the short thing and almost always one person does all the work and the other two so so most of the the beginning of the th of the short group project is two people trying to figure out who's going to be able to get out of the work most and while the third person does everything for the team and %HESITATION that doesn't happen are in our school we have full time faculty who actually are we paying close attention to the group projects and actually looking at the dynamic and if someone's not doing the work they're paying attention that nursing okay for this next round I want you to write the code and I want you to do the user research because it was the other way around last time so that everybody gets the practice of doing everything  and the way we have we have structured this is is we've made it a what we call a competency based program so instead of giving students a set of tests instead of quizzing them on book knowledge %HESITATION we have this set of competencies every course has somewhere between five and eight competencies and set of competencies for instance for the user research practices course %HESITATION some of the competencies were %HESITATION observing a usability test  planning a usability test moderating usually touch recruiting participants for usability test  synthesizing the results of these ability test so they they  they take that we take the the skills that we break it down into components and then for each competency there's a set of achievements show for example for %HESITATION  landing usability test you had to figure out what the objective of the test was and how many sessions were gonna run and what type of participants you wanted to we don't have a text books to to help them here they're kind of doing this there as like as they go along in real time they're doing this as they go I'm so they're they're  we've broken it down the achievements get broken into four categories we have developing things which are basically you have to go out and read how it's done and then reflect that you understand the way to do this so it's it's just it's just you can describe what you learn by reading or by watching a video or something like that but not having done it  then we have what are called emerging achievements emerging achievements are to take some toy application and and do a little usability test on that here what you know create some sketches and test the sketches whatever it is and that's just to show that you've practiced it and then  we have proficient level and proficient means I've actually done this on a real project to the students are always working on a project as a team that is a real project that they have to deploy and so I go back and I now conduct usability test on that project and I may do it several times and said that %HESITATION that's the the the proficient level and then we have distinguished level for students who may have come in already having studied user research somewhere having done it before where  they know how to do all this stuff nobody tests out of a class instead you go for distinguished and in distinguished you either teach somebody else so you become a teaching assistant for that class and you help teach somebody else to do it because when you teach something you learn something right so every time you did something you learn new things about it so %HESITATION teaching is good so you can get distinguish that way or you do things during the course that show that you've gone beyond the course material in a way that we never taught you to do so obviously you must know how to do this better she do it a type of study that is different than that  so %HESITATION  he  %HESITATION those those levels allow us to separate out  good students from grade students they allow us to make sure that students are learning the things that are hiring manager be interested and and when we designed the competencies we designed them in mind where we can actually share them with the hiring managers why things we learned as we were talking in our research for the school when things to learn is that  for the most part  the reaction the hiring managers have  from people who come right out of school is they're surprised at what they don't know they're like this person got an MBA in in designer they got in it and I got a bachelor's in human computer interaction how come they don't know how to do a basic usability test right there just shocked at what they don't know and what we realized after hearing this over and over again was at the schools are very bad  and actually sharing what they teach  and so everybody imagines that they're learning all these important things and then they find out that that's not what's taught in school at all  and so we've decided to make explicit what they weren't right so so the competencies are something we share with the hiring manager so they can see for every course we've taught what the students learn how to do and in fact the students can share what level of achievement where they got it developing emerging profession what level of achievement they got while they were in that class and they can actually talk to the project work they got them that level achievement make and say oh yeah no I conducted usability test I can walk you through my research plan and I can tell you how I did it so that that that ex experience based hiring process  is easy to do with our students because the students come prepared to share the stories and so you can say you basically have a menu it says I need students who have done this done this done is done as that's the position I'm failing and we can give you that and then and then the students will be able to tell you what they actually did to get there so that their two things that your school does really well it sounds like first year teaching them timeless principles and they can bring to any business for around time and the second is your teaching them alert right yes what  tricks for tips and I don't use word tricks now trick what are some things that people listening or watching this %HESITATION can start doing today to to generate a culture of self learning %HESITATION yet I don't know if that if that makes sense but that's yeah I mean it's it's it's well so  indeed  are you asking what what can they do to to learn themselves yeah like %HESITATION what what are some tips you can give for that because I actually don't think it's obvious that learning how to learn is a is a quote learned skill right I yeah I just can't right we we  we go through school thinking that %HESITATION this school will know how we need to learn they will basically open our skull poor information and close it up and send us on our way and %HESITATION that that's not how it works and it's stunning to me that we all come out of of these programs having never thought were selectively about how we learn so you know we we have a lot of track it and there are tricks to some extent because they're basically about slowing down and looking at what did you do so for example %HESITATION one of things that I work with teams to do is what I call journey critiques  add a journey critique is a critique of work but it's not to decide whether the work is ready to go on to the next stage where the work cat has all the things in it that's going to make it a good design it's to talk about it's to critique are how I got to hear right I was given this assignment I understood it to be these things I then went on this journey and now I've produced this this and result  let me tell you about how I got there when we tell show  %HESITATION all the work I did when the show you the sketches the the stuff that didn't quite work the way I wanted let's let's walk through that process and how did I make decisions and what principles emerged from the decisions I was making so that I could in for in the future I can say yeah when I run into this problem again this is how I'm going to deal with that thing and so it's it's this process of sharing that and what I've seen that when teams do that  the act of just putting that presentation together causes you to realize and look back and say wow I learned a ton in this thing in here I can actually list out all the things that I didn't know how to do when I started the project that I now know how to do and just just that active making explicit what I've learned  focuses you on the fact that will sometimes I'm learning more than others  and we've gotten to the point where we build into %HESITATION so you know at center center we have %HESITATION what a lot of teams have we have a daily stand up or scrum right this meeting where we all get together and we talk about it has the normal things in it you know what do we do since the last time  we did this one of my planning to do before the next time we do this what are the big obstacles that are my way what's the thing that I'm working on its highest priority right these are common questions but we've added a what we call the fifth question and it's got a name we call at number five  and  the fifth question is  what's the most important thing I learned since the last time we met and how will it change what I'm doing in the future don't tell anyone but that's really to quest  tions  but it turns out that by talking about that and every day having to report on something important that I learned in the last twenty four hours and how it's going to change what I do going forward that focuses me to start thinking about what did I actually word and we've gotten to the point where people who don't participate in the stand up we actually now have a slack channel called daily learning where everybody in the company is responsible for putting this there and in the school each of our students do exactly the same thing they have a stand up that they report their daily learning in and then they put in the slack channel because it turns out that by keeping a log of this stuff when you're reporting your daily learning your your often focused on what you're about to say and not listening always to what others say but when you have them in this channel you go back and read them and go  that's right yeah and that so for reflection exactly and taking those moments for reflection are really critical and we we don't we don't give our time to selves time to do this and when you do when you have a question like that in standup suddenly you you create this culture where learning something every day is one of the most important things we can do that suddenly means %HESITATION that we've decided that learning here is important and  personally I would love to see a shift away from this stupid idea of you know we need to fail  right I don't care whether we fail I only care whether we learned I know lots of people who have found ways to learn it without the shame of failing and yeah sometimes when you make mistakes you learn from them and that's awesome and you can be honest about that the either  I have to have made a mistake to learn something %HESITATION and by the way I know what people make a lot of mistakes and never seem to learn from them right so so I let's focus on the learning none of the failing yeah let's learn better just sounds like where someone should start is just having that self awareness to actually ask themselves that question and then exactly so that we need to jump into the communications actually should be super rapid fire okay %HESITATION  we're asking every guest this our community reach out to us and said these are the things that are burning up in their mind in their mind they're mine it's it's got the money in the fire  actually mind burning so the the first question is how do you explain so for someone in a business how do I use the words right  how do you explain the role of designed to people in a business  design is the rendering of intent  so are the role of design is to ask the question what are we intending  and did we get that  so that's that in its simplest form that's what is it you know what are people's roles when they're designers their designers are to a figure out what the intention is and be  render that intention and then figure out if they actually got there and you can break that into lots of different parts of the problem but that's in essence what it is  so %HESITATION in an organization it's it's it's being %HESITATION do this and  yeah we talked earlier about this  the idea that that at some point designers go away and designers go away when everyone is able to do that  at which point you L. A. designer is not necessary because everyone is designing everyone's a designer  the second question is around team organization %HESITATION have you noticed any patterns in how the design teams are actually structured and design mature companies  yes they're all made of people  arms  sort of like Soylent green  %HESITATION  now I I think design  design fills a void  right and so in different organizations the void is different in some places they have the technology down but they don't ever think about who they're users are so designs role is mostly about bringing the users and their needs into the organization and other organizations actually are very  they're very confident in the understand who their users are and what they're trying to do but they don't actually know how the technology works so there the design is about getting the technology to do what it needs to do and I I I this this question keeps coming up in there isn't one thing that design does which is why this idea of hiring at designer because they were designer someplace else they can be a designer for us well if we have different voids than they had that person did very different things and may not be able to help us with our  avoid in fact if they come in thinking that we are just like the place they used to be they are probably not going to work at all and so  %HESITATION we have to get to a level of specificity that is way more detail because it it fills a void right if we're talking about rendering intent is it that the intent is wrong is it that the rendering is broken right which one is it it you're gonna need people with different skills depending on what that is and so designers basically fill voids and that's that's  %HESITATION  it doesn't sound sexy though I guess on some level that is what sex is  but we don't have to go there the the %HESITATION the V.  okay this is this  you put whatever all to put whatever label on this you will %HESITATION the %HESITATION the key thing is that that design is really about helping the organization understand  what is intentions are and how to render it and and you you fill in where you need to helping you don't fill in where the where the organization seems quite competent should designers measure and present results to people in the business in any specific way like is this %HESITATION  if you're if you're designing your presenting to non designers your body of work not in an interview setting but in your business day today design activities there are there any specific tactics %HESITATION ways to present your ideas to people that aren't apps  right I mean a lot of %HESITATION %HESITATION you did you first have to do is figure out what way can people receive the work right right so again this goes back to the literacy fluency master if they don't understand the different good about design your your presentation has to be all about good and bad design right you have to talk about how what you either have an hour had in the past is not good design it to talk about what are the failure to the design of your competition give to talk about what makes your competition good you think about what your existing stuff does well so the you don't break it and then you have to talk about how this thing that your building is going to improve upon that and you may have to break it down and put it into terms that have nothing to do with the actual design itself so you have to speak a completely different language  I I often and and helping folks talk to executives and  one of things that I learned a long time ago is that in essence all executives  are worried about  five things there's only five things executives really care about right increasing revenues decreasing costs increasing the number of new customers who are using this thing  getting much more money from the existing customer base  and that's often retention or %HESITATION just additional services and %HESITATION this amorphous thing on a shareholder value which %HESITATION  it's only amorphous because we don't know really how to speak about it but it's actually quite simple it's it's the long term sustainability of the business you know if if if there's a housing crisis how do we get through that  if there's an inn on economic downfall if there's a war you know how how we going to survive when our competitors can't if there's a new technology how we adapt so so %HESITATION %HESITATION those those five things that's what executives are prime focus on that's what they're trained to focus on school that's what makes some really good at what they do over hundreds of years of running institutions they they've boiled it down those five things so I mean Gee if you're gonna talk about design of the talk about design in terms of those things house are designed an increase revenues how's it gonna decrease costs maybe it's going to reduce support cost maybe it's gonna stop developers from %HESITATION building features that that nobody ends of using which is waste right how's it going to attract new customers how's it going to get more money out of existing customers how's it going to help us survive in the long term are we creating technical that are we latched into a technology that if it becomes obsolete or the legal %HESITATION suddenly we can't use it anymore you know %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION so those that's what design is and so being able to talk in those terms get you way more progress with executives Dan saying this is great design uses of the trust me  and we can end here as the role of design but we're having so we we we really are and like I mean I I wish I could spend like ours were talking about me to  yeah I I am I'm sad  %HESITATION okay so as the as the role design continues to evolve %HESITATION what are some sorry as the purpose of this I continue so Paul what are some  holes and methods that you think might emerge over the next five years  %HESITATION I have no idea  I mean I I think that  we're going to see  much more emphasis on end to end experience right so this idea that experience isn't just the application or the dialog box that I'm dealing with but is this bigger thing and we have to think about the bigger thing and and we have to think about what it's like when a customer first meets us and what it's like all the way through their lifetime with us and how do we extend that wife time and how do we get more revenue from them over that lifetime and and all the things and I think that that and how do we get them to tell other people to come talk to us  all those things are sort of that but that's not new that's been going on for a long time I  I'm not a futurist people ask me all the time so what's you X. gonna be like in five years I'm like well they're going to be people I can guarantee that part there's probably gonna be some amount of technology I guarantee that beyond that I'm not going to find anything %HESITATION  I'm a historian I asked the question  people came out with a product  what was their intention did it meet that intention now why was the blackberry a popular thing why doesn't anybody have a blackberry anymore  and why did the iPhone do better the blackberry those the question I'm most interested and because that's I think where the real meat of the problems are I don't think we've spent  enough time trying to understand what has happened in the past  I think we spend so much time looking forward and not looking back that we we've this wealth of information on the table that could be so helpful to us because we can understand why a successful products became successful or why failed products inevitably failed we we can suddenly got to this point where we can say wow let's not do what they did let's do with these guys and so %HESITATION I think that we need  %HESITATION we need to be less forward looking so I actually don't care what the next three to five years have I want to understand how the last thirty years tells a story that we can learn something from that will make the next three to five years better and that's where I'm focused so I've I've I'm clueless  I I I think we will all have %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION processors imbedded under our skin and %HESITATION %HESITATION is the alternate and airport  airports will finally be a delightful experience that in both
