resolution monies Bobby Ghosh all him Jared around it we're speaking the twenty five masters of the design industry we're still in New York we're still having the time of our lives thank you for joining us again Jerry who speaking to today we're speaking with Scott Belsky Scott is the founder of the hands he's gonna tell us how to maximize our creative output how to use constraints to boost your creativity and the patterns he seen in top design companies I can't wait to watch this episode but stick around right after this partner message we're gonna get to it  thanks a square space for their support whether you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move with squarespace visit squarespace dot com and enter the code high resolution one word for ten percent off your first purchase  thanks for joining us thanks for having me what's one thing about the sign that's clear to you that you don't feel as is clear to other people it's hard to take one thing %HESITATION I think that a few things become clear to me first of all  design is very much the little things that make a big difference I think that little things tend to be overridden and big corporations and %HESITATION and sometimes do you prioritize and small new teams and yet some of these little things like whether it's via a static in the  in in in in some part of the user experience our product whether it's a decision to professionally photograph %HESITATION your apartments where being the whether it's all the little decisions  making a difference I think it's one thing that a lot of monsters and I mean with %HESITATION say %HESITATION yeah we'll get to that but they don't prioritize it I think the other thing that %HESITATION that companies later on forget is that you know well the %HESITATION well the science of a of scaling %HESITATION at a business you know is is %HESITATION is really like the core you know %HESITATION  business type of %HESITATION yeah %HESITATION practices %HESITATION you know the %HESITATION the the art of scaling a business you know is very much design it's it's it's non skilled things it's interactions with people it's making the experience %HESITATION %HESITATION actually designed you know in a way that's consistent from start to finish %HESITATION and that's another thing that's that's that that tends to be forgotten and the last thing I would just say in the Austin for one thing is that on the design is not only something that's customer facing people  build tools deeply influenced by the tools that they use to build tools and so designing your internal systems the tools that you use the business plan and making it more accessible and using principles of design and marketing to help people engage with business strategy is critical to get people lined what are some of these principles of design  I think it's helping people visibly see progress as it's happening rather than just  cutting it out of the plan because it already happened mean you have to feel progress or to make more progress I think a big part of it is merchandising the actual plan that what's action  all next to stuff needs to be merchandise to people and how do you merchandise with design %HESITATION with great copy with %HESITATION less is more with %HESITATION models and not that are translated into graphics and and these are just things that will do and will spend time on for our customers and our marketing campaigns and maybe our boards when it comes to Internazionale it matters a lot and %HESITATION and not only does it matter to help people get aligned but also help yourself and as an entrepreneur I would always help translate using illustrator in our business plan to something really simple and and graphically %HESITATION illustrated in a way that helped me also understand it so if you want to have a great founders emissions centric let's go back in your history the last ten or so years have been be hands me a famous for having built a platform to help creatives show their work actually show finish work to the world even wrote a book making ideas happen which inspired me to start I'll start a told you that before we speak respect for the first time and then %HESITATION your new project which is the journey in between %HESITATION is also about maximizing rate about maximizing the potential in between in the harder parts of the project to yeah what there's there's a threat here there's a there's a common thread I can pull what is that correct well %HESITATION as a couple things here first of all when I when I say that in our business and I have always in mission centric and %HESITATION and what I'm also implying is that I'm also medium agnostic in the sense that it or something I really am passionate about and I feel as a  problem with solving and also is paired with empathy of the people are actually suffering from that problem in this case would be and so was the disorganization of the creative world and if I there is no attribution knowing who did what  the solution to that I thought should be medium agnostic meaning it should be a network high technology tensely a book we also had a conference and is now in its ninth season and you conference and of a series of paper products organization I mean it it sort of seems crazy from an investor perspective for a company to be so court in court all over the place yet in every instance the mission of all these things was the same to organize creative people  looking back on it I think that that was a long game that really could have killed us many times in the short term because when you're spreading your self to then %HESITATION it introduces rest it splits are the energy of the team in two different places %HESITATION if you can somehow pull it off you end up having a more holistic brand that is really about a mission rather than a particular medium and so all of your competitors that are medium centric like I'm a technology company or I'm I'm a conference company if they can't compete with you running circles around them with your brand and with the experience of three sixty real experience you delivered to customers so I think there is one thread which is that when I really am committed to solving a problem I try not to be confined by a particular medium and this new product you referred to I'm not I'm currently calling the journey in between is really just an effort to better understand chronicle what great artists crunch print orders or even leaders of the companies do do indoor the middle of their journey the mass  the metal that no one wants to write about that no one wants to talk about press ignores is full of anonymity and self doubt and ambiguity and it's so fascinating to me how some of those journeys fell and others you succeed what's done in the middle that we can learn from them there is definitely a gap between someone's greater potential like their actual output %HESITATION and it's interesting that you kind of touch on that that like you know that  trop without space between like the idea of actually putting for most things die  well what do this what are some of the things that you seen people do to actually get through that stage  well what you can do is you can't believe that your incredible vision for what you may actually achieve at the end is enough to keep you motivated  I think that's a mess that %HESITATION you know I I can imagine where we'll be in years from now and that's going to that's what's gonna keep me going  it may get you started in may help you at times but the truth is is that we are all hard wired for short term rewards %HESITATION I remember one of the quotes shared by friend will send one of our investors and Beyonce in one of our first ninety nine you conferences where he said that the two greatest injections in life for heroin and a weekly salary %HESITATION six SO hard unplug yourself we are born with this desire for short term rewards from our parents in the form of love and gratification and then we get a check on the tasks in grade school and we had agreed on the course and we get a weekly salary in a potentially a bonus at the end of the year and then suddenly one plug yourself from that when you choose to pursue an independent career as a freelancer or when you  to be an entrepreneur or start a band or anything else it takes years in order to bring to fruition  and you you can't rely and without the short term the words and when you're not getting them the question is what do you do to survive that trough you have to hack yourself you have to hack your own reward system you have to find ways to keep yourself in your team gauged how do you do that all kinds of fun things some of its design putting things around you celebrating milestones the basically made up in one of our things that I like to tell a story about a behance was every time you tighten behance and Google and always said do you mean enhance teaming enhance so we were always a mistake and so one of the things I would tell my team in the early days was eventually if we get enough Beyonce users to make profiles and projects me post enough blog posts and we get enough link tax through all the hustle we're doing to network around the web we will no longer be a mistake Google will think were real and inevitably like a year later suddenly behance came up when you type it in and then I think it was a year after that were beyond C. became popular here in the states  but it was just a little hacks like that make all the difference  you've written quite a bit about this what role do you constraints play in the creative process so I should really start on that answer with the %HESITATION the question that I would ask a lot of the designers I interviewed when I was really making it is hot would oftentimes go to a very productive prolific designers and I would ask them for their story around their night near Brighton freeze like when did things go horribly wrong and more often than not %HESITATION the stories would start with a  open brief that they got from particular client where the client said listen  big picture don't even think about budget during the about timeline yet just like big picture and that those routinely were the stories where it was insufferable process to figure out where to go which illustrates the importance of imports of constraints  constraints on earth our inner sense of resourcefulness which is much more important than resources resources on this is %HESITATION is making use of what's in front of you entering yourself with things around you the constraints whether it's the time minor some idea that someone else shared I just don't think that creatives can operate productively in a vacuum in an empty space with the court the the supposed infinite resources and no noise noise is actually a critical part of our process mistakes and it is something to think about as our  life becomes less friction filled and as the %HESITATION products and the services that we use to anticipate our every need kind of iron out the friction of of our daily being what is that gonna due to the fact that we know creativity is actually spawned from getting lost were sitting in traffic we're dealing with deadlines are limited resources it's it's an interesting question that kind of goes in the face of everything we think we want the manufacture constraints in your teens when you work with not just designers would really anyone a hundred percent that's the role of the leader of the lower the room one  the roles of the leader is to constantly  reiterated merchandise the constraints and when you don't have logical obvious constraints find them seek them right and and and and %HESITATION and merchandise that because they help everyone and you can always  maneuver around them you can always there's always an exit plan an exit strategy if something's not working but %HESITATION it it's it's empowering to the team to have tangible  anchors in the form and and just just so we're not in the abstract for a second with a deadline be a constraint deadline is a constraint a %HESITATION a %HESITATION a session on the client's behalf that we consider as a constraint a %HESITATION you know limitation around the type of content or a direction that seems to can %HESITATION constraining is obviously you know constraints in itself %HESITATION these are all ways of making us again tapping into our inner resources on this finding a way around it you know and it's up to the founder or the leader to to the fine line those constraints are important this is not just putting it out there like ten thousand dollars one week merchandising piece it was so important and again we always forget the importance of internal merchandising  what is the idea generation gap it's something that we her you written on the for what what is it and how can a designer know if they're in it  well I do believe that %HESITATION that  ideas are the culprit in most ideas ever seen the light of day in and that's because  as as creative people we are addicted to the energy and excitement and frankly the high that a company is a new idea it allows us to escape the doldrums of project management is the %HESITATION it allows us to escape our lives and %HESITATION and all of our self doubts and all of our daily daily grind %HESITATION %HESITATION and and and so the new ideas exciting and and the the the first thing we do when we get into one of those doldrums of project management you know one of those periods of time where were suffering as we just try to come up with another idea and I like to say that's why they're more Hafren novels in the world there are novels  so I think it's important to be optimistic about the future but always pessimistic about tasks and never  ever truly satisfied with the progress you're making always kind of question yourself and bring yourself down to like the pragmatic realization that you're not making enough progress you have to just Hassel more %HESITATION the more pain you know the more potential glory in these are the types of things I think as creative as we have to an entrepreneur is we have to constantly %HESITATION kindly remind ourselves out of and I think that there is this is strange what some of the most productive artistic thing to ask a little bit in the pain of their process I think X. because they know that that's when it's real  I had to use a trick when I get all lofty with my ideas and try and find cynics are people around me that that tend to shoot them down yeah right I'm a friend befriend them I think that the inclination is to say  I've got amazing idea and I want I want to speak to a kindred spirit okay because I really really want them to love what I what role do skeptics or or send explain this process  is an important question because to your point  creative is like to hire engage people for their teams that are also like them here is that typical okay but I like to have a beer with this person is why creative's higher creatives and becomes this intoxicated orgy of idea generation and nothing ever gets done and so you kind of need this sober monitor or or does need a driver %HESITATION who is constantly reminding you about the budget in the time line and the constraints %HESITATION in there they're sort of  the opposite of the dreamers %HESITATION which are sort of the Debbie downers of the world's the people are constantly saying wait a second  yeah well the dreamers going to bed at night super excited to any new idea and introduced her her his team the next day on the on the country the doers are going to bed at night excited when there's nothing new in the pipeline no new things to interrupt our schedule and take us off track  the healthy productive creative team has an extraordinarily strong immune system that is powered by the doers not the dreamers and if you think about the human body the way we stay healthy is our muse system kills off everything that's new right and only when we get an organ transplant do we need to suppress the immune system and empower the did the dreamers to take hold in introducing new organ something new actually changes who we are and so it a great leader of a productive creative team and I saw this many times in the course of writing making it has happened in the inner  these are these teams I would meet  a great leader is constantly first of all hiring a lot of dealers not to streamers empowering the doers ninety nine percent of the time but then making sure that the chemistry allows the doers to take a backseat and the dreamers to take hold when they're something new a new problem to be solved a new brief to be considered you know that's when you empower the creative so dreamers  as far full %HESITATION even listening companies like Pinterest remember where we Parker %HESITATION these really strong brands that people look to has the sign leaders as well right %HESITATION in your investments like have you seen any pattern some of these companies as far as how they approach and the poor design  well he's one of those companies was either co founded by a designer or %HESITATION had leaders that  really really value design decisions and talent at the very start other companies none of them outsourced design at any point in time  which is actually interesting because most companies at least in the beginning to outsource design and when you outsource something where you're basically saying is it is definitely not your competitive edge  what you do is you outsource things you just need like tables and that sort of stuff that needs to get done but is not really core to what's going to make you stand out and so I I I look for teams that don't outsource their competitors in an inch which is I. think watch a cool thing to look for as an investor and if I think the design  is a real core part of of what they will be building and how they'll succeed and send out you know that that's that's a starting point  %HESITATION I also think that the %HESITATION the open  yes to feedback around product and design decisions the value in like Morty Parker you Neil really would put a stamp on anything they would go out that represented the brand of that company %HESITATION and has he's scaled his business he's had to scale the ability to make sure that everything is consistent on brand on point and design is a huge part of the consistency of the user experience of working park whether it's the shipment of your glasses or the store the you go into the website you deliver you visit %HESITATION or the %HESITATION or the emails that you get you know the design is just a constant threat and %HESITATION and there's internal operations to support that your contracts out to other companies I won't name that I worked at before where you had different departments making different decisions and if your product manager you have no say over what the email looks like that goes to your customers that's a problem %HESITATION okay so interesting now outsourcing implying that you're maybe using a freelance or an agency of some sort right %HESITATION you will the platform for freelancers agency designers client site designers all of them the kind of celebrate the work that they do I'm curious if you see freelancers an agency designers and and and and people actually work on the client side as standing in stark contrast to each other yeah and what can we learn from each other while it's in it's a great question because I actually have seen many examples of hiring a create great freelancer and bring them essentially in house as an extended part of a team working directly with you into me that is alas outsourcing and going to an agency where they're basically managing you through an account manager  and they're hiding in some ways their process and they're hiding actually who's doing the work so I've seen many examples where companies would in brace at a particular freelancer for something extremely important is often times as you guys know some of the greatest greatest creative talents in the world don't work for anyone but themselves because they can't  I don't think that that means you're essentially outsourcing it %HESITATION they actually partner deeply with brands and companies  agencies on the other hand I believe are and maybe some of controversially are any %HESITATION are a in a vast edge from the past near this is it they're coming from a time when you didn't know who to go to get something done  you didn't have the tools to manage creative talent on their own terms are where they want to work and the idea of working with screen is I guess it you know I'm gonna let someone else do that because I know company and %HESITATION and they're from a time where design wasn't a competitive advantage and %HESITATION and I just think and it's and where there was an old boy network of people who would place ads and come up with ideas and execute down  I I think that that time is beyond it behind us I think some of the greatest most innovative agencies today are actually just building rosters of freelancers that they have relationships with on platforms like behance and that many of these companies and then the chase basically just have a outbound sales force slash account management effort to build new business so there were their role in all this now is that they own the relationship yep they're they're building the client relationship and then they are not bringing graves in house because  I know that that's sort of an old thing right there engaging craters on their own terms and they're serving as a conduit which is the step towards eventually then not even existing at all and companies being able to find town directly %HESITATION build relationships and by the way how great is that for the talent yet the town basically gets paid more the client pays alas because the middle man is cut out essentially end the relation to that Spahn between the creator town in the company or brand yields a better output yeah  %HESITATION  are there any roles %HESITATION responsibilities that you feel designers are not looking to are not building that might be costing them influence and credibility that these companies  well I think that %HESITATION I think that  with all that we're talking about here all this new opportunity that designers have to work directly with clients and to %HESITATION really be the competitive advantage of all these different types of businesses across industry is with all that opportunity comes responsibility art what is at risk what is our responsibility it means becoming a better manager in means being able to manage up and influence out a story which is entirely different skills that they don't teach you this stuff in design school right I mean this is %HESITATION this is stuff you have to learn through on your own  a lot of history experience a lot of its through reading books and understanding and attending conferences and and considering that a big part of your education is not just design skills now it's you know now it's also management skills and and %HESITATION and and and  in getting yourself on that learning hers so I think that's a big part of it I also think that  being able to make sure you can provide for yourself simple things like asking for more money %HESITATION knowing what you're worth  holding your clients accountable being able to fire clients when you feel like they are sapping your energy and your soul and %HESITATION and recognizing that that short term sacrifice will yield long term gain  I think that these are all sorts of parts of that responsibility set that we have to take on %HESITATION I want to go back for a quick second to back to the agency world because there are tens probably tens of thousands of agency designers listening to this I hope yep %HESITATION I want to give them a snowball's chance here for a second %HESITATION  or not as I will give them a real chance what are what should agencies other than building  winds of contacting relationships with freelancers best freelancers in the world what else can agencies do to redeem themselves %HESITATION and not be mired by the legacy of what agencies were I have it's a great question because I work with some amazing agency is %HESITATION and %HESITATION and what these agencies can do I think and if their bass is being in the nine drunk participants in the process of bringing an idea to fruition odd bringing a different perspective for companies that are not thinking enough about brand because it's not in the DNA of their founders or enough about design %HESITATION they're great agencies become a thought partner and have a seat at the table the agencies that I've worked with that I recommend and %HESITATION and we and want to work with again  again insisted on having a seat at the table  dot the actual talent into the process rather than trying to almost keep the town secret and present the know the business contact as the the person that you should interact with %HESITATION  the best agency that I work with are willing to give attribution to the people who actually did the work because they are confident enough that they're adding enough value into the equation with the ideas and with that process improvements that day %HESITATION they're not they're not afraid of admitting that someone's doing the work just seems crazy but is actually you know to common place  so %HESITATION and and and really you're also in bass your greeting agencies are willing to work with a brand that's a little off and %HESITATION you know I think of agencies like red antler in New York that takes a group of %HESITATION guys like the founders of Casper you know the mattress company and says you know this is all gonna be about your brand and does is a long term partnership to bring the castle Grande the life and to so many people %HESITATION which I don't think would have happened without written or someone I know there a lot of examples like that so that's the modern age agency I think it's oftentimes agency founded by creative talents and %HESITATION and really run %HESITATION in a way that %HESITATION you know is is thinking about the modern day Klein needs yeah you spoke about one of the skills of designers need to %HESITATION  develop is managing and %HESITATION I'm assuming presenting as well right %HESITATION so senior designer at a company and you're about to present a projects to the CEO or non designer executive right  %HESITATION how should that designers start the discussion yeah %HESITATION what are the things that they should actually focus on in that discussion and how do they actually keep the person's attention which I see is probably one of the biggest issues  listen a mock up is greater than has more power than hours of discussion and debate and I've been in so many meetings where there's just this debate and back and forth and memos being rad and distributed and everything else and then someone just as let's just look at them and if the designers in the room great if they're not like shame on you bring them in and show some mock ups and suddenly within minutes everyone's aligned  as to what should be done next  designers it assert themselves to make that happen more quickly sadly still to this day it's either the product manager or the business unit leader or the CEO or you know someone else who has to advocate for the designer to have a voice in that conversation and has to make it so that the mock ups and up leading rather than following us designers you take that's part of the responsibility you know taking responsibility of making sure that design leads you know the structure in companies  either gets in the way of the S. R. supports it I've always insisted on having designers report directly to me I remember when I took over as VP of product related OB or there is actually a design firm basically in the company like a union if it's like a separate division if you will  I insisted on having a series of designers report to me on the things that I was leading it was very controversial and rightly so because designers who were amazing amazing town designers and company were saying  you know why you know why are there now designers embedded in products and business like what does that mean for us as it's like X. internal agency  I think you have to position designers out to have the influence to be able to assert themselves and to lead the discussion when you're trying to solve something as a business so there's a lot of structural work that needs to be done to make this happen you more broadly throughout business and and and and other industries %HESITATION thing business so %HESITATION but designers play a critical role and I pass should should push for that and and in this example where you ask for design report directly to you how were they structure beforehand like where they reporting to anyone like we'll do that look like designers reported up into and this is many companies right and most even start up companies there is a person who leads design designers report up to him or her in there our product managers and people running the business units and designers are then stopped on these projects but there are there are there %HESITATION compensation in their performance is actually still review it and determine by the person leads design and so that's like a break right there like what what do you mean like the designers so critical to the business in the product yet isn't able to be compensated by the person who's running the business or the product doesn't make any sense and then like why would they feel like they can have their one on ones and get management advice and be able to assert themselves if they're working alongside people but not people that they actually work for our west and so it's on it's just a it's a bit not some cult cultures in chemistry is can still overcome this with the relationships why not structure it to succeed in the first place so I those are the types of things have to think about the incoming got  and coming back to this meeting this presentation Brian %HESITATION I seen examples where the designer gets to lead this meeting and they go they present they've not even percent they just put a mock right and then everyone just jumps on that mock what ends up happening is the feedback or the discussions that happened is not actually relevant at all to the discussion right I'm so what context to the designer be providing when they put that thing up on the screen to drive the converse is an art is so important it's a great question it starts with  asking you have to look we have to lead the conversation you don't just put up a mock and and then sit back and let the firing squad begin right he put up a mocking you say this is a concept  what questions do you have and and this is the problem that you asked us to solve like the reason this mark exist is to solve the problem following problems  now start peppering the questions and then you help people understand it and %HESITATION and then when people start to say things like make the logo bigger you know maybe make this blue or me a great designer asks the people to then rephrase it eyes problems they think still exist  I I actually am worried that people are not going to know how to buy  %HESITATION why do you say that it's not clear to me like how you actually go where's the action in or what's the defaults and I want to make sure that ninety percent of people actually do acts those are the types of responses that's the feedback you should be getting not design direction you should be getting problems that still exists because designers roles to solve problems and if your audience still has its problems you haven't succeeded yet  %HESITATION I want to first of all Paula Jones to our listeners of yours about all the noise

like Facebook Capital One Netflix and every day I work with remote teams all the time and I found that keeping a healthy dialogue is really important without it building strong work relationships gets

vantage when the using vision sweet a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit envision out dot com slash high resolution for three months free  do you have any mentors  do you have mentors %HESITATION I have I feel like I have rather than one key mentor I have different mentors for different things  and these are people who have gone back to at certain times or help me at pivotal moments %HESITATION and %HESITATION I think it's dangerous to have one person you feel you want to look up to emulate because you don't want to play someone else's playbook yeah at the same time  I have made a mistake of insulating myself too much  and %HESITATION as an introvert screaming nature and I always felt like well it's my own journey and no one else can you help me and and at times I've been humbled by the fact that as soon as I forced myself to ask somebody like what you would you do I just totally realize that I was reinventing the wheel or that there's a logical answer so I push myself to go and visit these mentors occasionally and %HESITATION and sometimes I'm finding especially these days is not a particular answer all gatt it's more just the conversation is some of the best discussions don't have an answer they're just  aware unwinding thought  %HESITATION  %HESITATION interpret yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't have the cash at Scott Belsky okay  at one point it is a no I will point you to the right %HESITATION there's quite a bit there's there's an intimidation factor right you look up to someone and you want to find them you want to seek them you don't impose too much for you yeah you want to ask them for help %HESITATION what's the right way to go about finding a mentor and then I'd like to I'd like to talk a little bit about %HESITATION how do you keep that relationship kindled is important to remind yourself that  everyone super busy and has preoccupations and %HESITATION you know someone that seems like they've made it and they would be a great mentor probably has a whole other suite of things that they're not worried about it up at night thinking about and whatever else and %HESITATION and so  you may mentorship comes out of relationships so when you just reach out to someone and say I want to coffee it's you know it's basically saying I want you to blindly give me your time and %HESITATION and it's I don't know like I always am torn about it because no one had I I like giving back but I also  how much time do I actually have and I also feel like my responsibilities use my time towards the things I can make the most impact and and often times those are talking a larger groups are working on projects that I think need to see the light of day and %HESITATION I'm not telling my day up with copies of people I don't know Sir I'm I'm toward you know it's a it's a good question I think that  it starts with making it both ways %HESITATION actually one of my %HESITATION one of my kind of mentors so I was recently that %HESITATION visit went to visit he was saying to me that is  I was thanking him for his time and he was like no no no like this is exactly what I'm going through to a different level of my life and so there was this parallel that I felt in some ways he was saying this is why I'm giving you the time because actually I'm going yeah I needed to as what he was telling me and so it's great to find people like that and %HESITATION and there have been people that have reached out to me you know that I've sort of sad you know I'm going through a career transition right now %HESITATION debating this you know investor verses operator versus founder versus CEO and and I'm thinking %HESITATION like I actually think about that as well like I'm always I'm kind of tearing there as well and I want a conversation around that so %HESITATION so I think you want like all relationships to be especially in business to be mutually beneficial  I think you want to post that %HESITATION and also just asking a question like someone someone will ask me center in an email and I don't even know the person but they'll pose like a specific question like two or three sentences of where they're at right now at a specific question %HESITATION just answered it so not a formalized mentor me asking for an hour of my time with their scenic listen like if you were deciding between this challenges this job like Scott what would you what kind of questions would you be thinking about and I'll say like this is what I would be doing if it's helpful great took me five minutes in a in a in a taxi or you know do you think they're more examples %HESITATION of when someone who thinks they need a mentor is really just needing to do this just ask a question  you know I think that %HESITATION I think that I think they just getting a question asking a question in getting their data points is governed by  I also have to say that a lot of the best lessons are learned the hard way and I do think that we get paralyzed too often by thinking we need someone else's advice or help when in truth we just need to do the work and we just need to try  we just need to throw ourselves into something and recognize that somehow some way a labor of love always pays off just not how you expect in I I I'm I'm amazed by how true that is I've seen so many people take jobs because they paid five or ten thousand dollars more or jobs because they said well I need to do this for a few years in order to do this later on and then they get stock they become middle managers or unhappy right and then the opportunity costs just gets higher overtime is switching in trying something new  I have never seen a situation where someone who was doing something because they truly love it ended up just like totally as a failure  it just always leads to something and they may start in doing something and they may make no money for awhile but they just like sort of end up somewhere else or having a chance circumstantial conversation with someone else that then leads into another great role something always kind of pans out it's as weird kind of nature of humanity and evolution I guess is that you just if you keep on this path towards  no warmer warmer warmer warmer %HESITATION you get somewhere in so that means that stock sort of China planning getting more advice before making a decision just make an incremental step toward something that's interesting to you and it will pan out do you believe in building on your strengths or  were trying to make yourself hold by focusing on areas that you need more help on  yeah %HESITATION well here's a way out answers to this question is that %HESITATION what we're all trying to do in our careers as freelancers entrepreneurs are leaders of the company is is survived the massing middle of big bold projects and the messy middle to me is just two things it's interns and optimization it's this involves Heil kind of way operate in and %HESITATION is definitely not linear right it's always you have this great idea %HESITATION should this is really hard to execute okay like I'm in a progress was not linear it's actually very ball tile full of these downs these lows which you have to indoor and these highs would you have to optimize and the highs are when something for some reason works and it could be in the way your bring people on your team your optimize your team that could be the way your optimizing your only working and more often than not it's the way your product is working or not working  so tense your question I think it's all about optimizing the little things that seem to be working which are your strengths sometimes they're just circumstantial things that happen to work that surprise you %HESITATION or little things are getting traction your designer and you throw up all the stuff in your personal you know never cares and suddenly one projects goes viral you know and you're like oh I should be doing more of this class of this I really think that dots how greatness in a becomes even greater is when you start to optimize and emphasize the things that people are paying attention to in that are working and naturally de emphasize that things that aren't I don't think it's about obsessing over fixing things that are broken which is country to live  that you should always fix things that are broken don't fix things that are that are broken %HESITATION so insurance in those lows in optimizing the things that work in both how you work as well as how your product is performing  you want to give a talk about the importance of deciding what you're willing to be bad at yeah when you're working on a product right first can you just explain that philosophy and second do you think this is a tool that designers can use to help focus their career  well what I mean by deciding what you're willing to be bad at is facing first of all the fact that if you try to be good at everything you're not gonna be good at any one thing  better than everyone else right and %HESITATION and and that's how in individual or brand really stands out as a competitive advantage in an industry which is also we were all grappling towards we all want a competitive advantage in something whether it's to ponder fear illustration or infographics or whether it's you know being the best airline or being the best whatever and so in the process of doing that  when you need to look at is the kind of factors that distinguish you in your industry  our day is it your chief  raise the price is it availability like you're the one that's always just available in people call you when they need someone last minute is it your especially good infographics and you're like just so good at design that kind of comes from math is it that you're like such a good concept artist or that you're like so clever you always finally little thing you put in that everyone kind of and you know kind of engages with on a personal level  find your  thanks but were you shouldn't be trying to do is be the cheapest and the most available and the bass it doesn't doesn't that doesn't that and so when you look at that  X. access right here like okay I want to be I don't want to be known for price I'm gonna be expensive and that's just the way I feel I'm gonna be right %HESITATION not competing on ninety nine designs or something like that like I want I'm going for quality %HESITATION and %HESITATION you know and I don't want to be known for  maybe I don't want to be known photography work %HESITATION I want to be known for these you know these quick illustration type of work that can be done quickly or whatever it is for you and then when you make a decision that affects everything it affects how you market yourself effects the takes a project to say yes to and no two and you start to have like the standards that you project your portfolio through the contents you right through what you stand for use half to find those things to distinguish you  and I think that's so important and it's easy to say but it's hard to do because when we're in the thick of it in our careers are in leading our businesses were liable to just take every opportunity we can get reliable to say yes for good everything we're trying to be the best %HESITATION price and availability and this and that in in truth we really standing out %HESITATION through is is finding out what you're really bad at and are you are you deciding this at the beginning of your career like you know the the thing that many designers it's hot when I come out of design school or even just college or high school really %HESITATION is to try everything figure out you know what you do like in and focus your attention on the things that you do like or is this a self assessment it you're doing from day one I don't think you should decide right to be  your career is if the figure it out need to figure out what your strengths are what you're being known for its kind of back to that optimizing questions like what's working where people are Peter %HESITATION my client saying I love working with you because you're always available to the last minute things where people are saying to you that cover you made for us is just like is winning awards for that story and like all my gosh you're so good at these you know taking like almost like a a moment in time and capturing it visually or were they saying to you these Long Beach projects like creating a new typeface or something like that I just love working with you in that capacity in your student did the rigor you haven't seen gaze of the project for years amazing like you hear that in the beginning of your career and as your career progresses but then you have to decide what am I going to be known for if you don't stop and make that decision you will never be known for anything  I have a question around the design community landscape %HESITATION years ago when you started the hands you know you were solving a problem for the design community and that problem was attribution and %HESITATION a place to be discovered yeah right %HESITATION since then to design landscape has changed a lot right there are a lot of things that remain the same but they're a lot of new things that did not exist by ten years ago right some really curious if you were to start be hands again today %HESITATION what would that look like like what would you be trying to solve a would you be going after  was it the big the big holy grail problem that I always wanted to solve with behance %HESITATION but did indeed have and we haven't yet as %HESITATION you know as a senator Hansteen family is %HESITATION is around a better way of matching  talent with opportunity that on  that sort of transcends traditional circumstantial ways that people get matched up  I don't think the answer is certain certain certainly the answer is not crowd sourcing I think that that hurts more than helps %HESITATION I don't think that these commoditizing market places for design are good %HESITATION I think that actually there's pricing power for the designer when here she is match with the perfect opportunity but how do you make it clear that that's the perfect person for you as a brand to work with how do you match the two of you and how do you make sure that great content personal rises to the top is not always the same usual suspects in our training at the top of a search %HESITATION and then %HESITATION and then how do you make to people work together in a superior way over time  with with high you know with a high price point and I think the dots there's so many like %HESITATION docks %HESITATION desk type of work you know whatever things in the world that help people matching it but it's still all about like price and availability and it's not about is high quality creative relationship between the client and a brand  so that's the problem that I find still very interesting and I think it still is B. had a head of the hands and adobe potentially or other companies out there so no we're we're running short on time you have to leave soon we've got a couple of communications that we want to get to church %HESITATION  and these could be rapid fire let %HESITATION how should designers explain the role of designed to people in their business  I think the designers should always  round design as the  as the discipline of problem solving right and %HESITATION  so it's E. as well as again those little things that make a big difference I think that it's also important for designers to help their clients internally or externally right I understand that %HESITATION that their solutions are are coming from years and years of experience and exposure and portfolios they looked at and critique and everything on my favorite stories about the whole kind of Paul rand Steve Jobs relationship was when they negotiated on the rate for so long and then like right and just sort of immediately scribbles this thing give Steve this thing and he's like what are you kidding me I continue this like six figure sum for like two minutes of working as a note for like thirty years of work and it's so but as part of the education Herve designers have to %HESITATION do their clients of the murders and where the solutions even coming from so making sure that your discipline is regarded as one of problem solving making sure that clients understand sometimes the little things actually make the biggest difference helping your clients understand that it's an end and experience that's been design is not just the splash page or some part of the product those are things that you need to push  the second question one you're the only designer at a company out of business %HESITATION what are the things that you can do to convince leadership of its value  well I think that showing not telling me a speaks volumes right  when %HESITATION better and there's also the aspect as  H. as in much has happened when you show something that  holds the argument and suddenly brings it to another level  sometimes you can actually  it is a mock up into a today and actually expedite the decision and help get people lineman for quickly and no one even knows that it was the design in the designer that that succession be attributed to and so it's important as a designer that circumstance to you to bring that %HESITATION to the leaders attention and this is why you know just taking a step back I feel very lucky to have had this design background from college and took all these design classes anyone in the business and then I built this new design community and really jumped into being a product designer basically with my team and also had about her leadership development to some always kind of is is a weird mix and the thing I am always taking out of it is that designers are not  considering themselves leaders in a team or not being powered as leaders in teams and the companies that I actually believe that design is competitive manage %HESITATION and empower designers to have that see the table and lead %HESITATION Andy structured internally incumbents in internal in the right way  are the ones that you know how that can happen there is come through the market place so we can and with this last question has the function of design continues to of all what are some roles and methodologies that you think will emerge over the next five years  well I think that the %HESITATION I think that design is starting to become a competitive edge on the enterprise tool side of things  I think that %HESITATION it's been such a consumer product focus and actually it's funny in the investor landscape people still consider themselves either consumer product investor or an enterprise rocking Vester in  you know what  it in a day their people using the products and when you're making the investment you need the same lands around the product sensibility and how the team is structured our designers and power to make a difference in all these different things sure the business model and go to market may be different %HESITATION in the pricing things like that but it but the products themselves need to be borne by the same principles and how do you get designers all jazzed up to work in a company that does enterprise tools in it was another challenge but I think that %HESITATION but I think maybe it's gonna make a difference if they were to see more of that I think that the the interface is the place where a lot of industries are finally becoming competitive in being determined in terms of who wins and sort of like that slapping hands game we're in a great product is building an interface for the technology that they built and then another product is building interface that just basically uses the API is about product and then another product is like an audible version of the no visual or at or at audio you I and it and it's like it's an interface game but guess what that's all designers right designers only interface in the future is going to be determined by interfaces by screens in our homes by audible cues by you know all these sort of a I supported %HESITATION frictionless interfaces it's exciting it's an exciting time to be a designer and to be thinking about industries and problems that just need to be rethought  the request and thank you Scott economic  he made it to the end congratulations thanks for watching the episode I really really hope you liked it  if you did
