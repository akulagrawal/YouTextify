hi I'm here with Richard vulture Richard is a US designer at Google senior UX designer that's right %HESITATION and has been working on you explore the last fifteen years thank you for joining us Richard it's a pleasure to be here today thanks for having to get started can you describe what user experience design is sure it's %HESITATION it's a big umbrella of several related disciplines that are all focused on the design of experiences %HESITATION to help up a individual person you know achieve some kind of goal %HESITATION and that covers a lot of different types of experiences most commonly we think about your software design but it's also things like environment design %HESITATION and maybe the design of physical products %HESITATION it could even be things like event coordination kind of anything that a user experiences that can be can constructed for them and when I was gonna first taught this there was gonna five key concepts it's the study of users and their contacts can the environment they operate and in order that we can design tools for them to achieve tasks that let them complete goals so users at contacts tasks and goals goals okay so let's start with the user who are they well the user is anyone who's going to use the product and the service that you're designing and and it's really important to remember that that runs a really wide range you know it's very easy to kind of when you're designing just think about designing for yourself or this like one super idealize user  you have in mind %HESITATION but in reality you're going to be building this for people with very different levels of experience with different contacts and different backgrounds that affect how they'll proceed this thing that you build for  right and how do I know who the user is well the key for that is something called user research %HESITATION I think it's kind of most associated with this idea of taking this product you're working on and and test can in some way you know having a user come in and try to perform a series of tasks %HESITATION that you would sign them and see how they do and see the things that are problems for them %HESITATION but user research really covers the whole end and development of the product and even before you've drawn your first screen you can engage with user research to go into your potential users homes or workplaces to start to understand in that context that's important to the way that they behave %HESITATION and what their goals are and what you've even kind of finished and shipped you can do things like a look at logs and try to analyze usage patterns see what people are doing with your product props kind of biased towards things he wanted to do more of or C. areas that they're spending a lot of time in that you have an anticipated
