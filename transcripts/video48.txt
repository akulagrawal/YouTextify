hi my name is Brian would I'm a web developer and I create a lot of different kinds of learning content for people to be able to learn that type of stuff and actually of Travis Nielsen here who is from Google and you know me a little bit about that %HESITATION I work at Google and search and then a %HESITATION work hard to teach people what I'm learning lately through videos like this or podcasts or speaking nights so we we have a lot of things that we go through as a you ex designer %HESITATION creating our our process or content or thing creating personas gathering research but they're definitely our best practices that we could follow absolutely so do you have any best practices let's say for research and do some of the best number one leg do some research and and it's funny because this can be something that  could be tempting to gloss over any because you're not producing the slick thing that you can show your investor or your client your like your understanding things you're learning and hand how do you how do you work that into a budget %HESITATION it's a line item learning but it but the truth is like do some research do it figured out right seems like it'd be easy to gloss over  another thing you can do is test risky ideas and crazy ideas as early as possible  and this is that's interesting because that it does that mean that we're trying to like save time later now to save your time save money says it's just risk you know like we want to mitigate that risk by trying things early okay  and another one is just to to when you're doing your research to make sure you're not leaned so heavily on on quantity  hated data or qualitative data that you have a balance between the two describe this to him yeah it's a qualitative data is like I found out that people don't like this or they feel this way about and that's the quality another quantitative data is that when I change this thing the blue nobody tapped on it that's the that's the quantitative as the quantity thing right here to balance those two things what do you get business wise and how people feel about it  and then the last thing you know the best way to do research the best practices is to partner collaborate with a researcher can be better than you for sure  what I do like the fact that you say if possible because there are some was out there that might be freelancers and we're kind of a one stop shop and that yeah yeah so we do we can yep products come in all shapes and sizes if you need to do your own research if possible partner so let's talk a little bit about best practices for some of the tools that we might actually use  %HESITATION I think you know  really understanding that all you ex tools are communication tools is gonna take you a long a long way and that that way you can start to it to balance for proficiency and perfection it's not about being the best designer it's about using the right tool to get the job done as quickly as possible might some of the tools we were talking about yeah in a flexible designer every day will be better than than the person who gets it perfect but it takes them forever and then what about being faster provision or speed I got the other one of the that's that's one of the things that I always look for in a tool is is how fast can help me to get the thing done %HESITATION all take a paper napkin sketch over initial prototype any day as long as it gets the thing done  there was talk a little about best practices for being able to test the prototype bird whatever's that we happen to have  sometimes it's kind of counter intuitive but we wanted we won it test in order to disprove our ideas  because we want to save time and money we're not trying to spend it on like wild crazy thing so test those early and often like we talked about in and and I deleted disprove your ideas you can we move on to the next thing that does work because we're we're we're prototyping we're not usually the code yet right can yeah of time and effort energy yeah right like low low low process or get that high answer early on other things is to look look for the unexplained and and and surprising things the during research in prototyping and stuff something will happen and then the best the the best %HESITATION follow one is not to say like %HESITATION this didn't happen but is say why didn't this happen so so try to explain try to be involved in that testing and and then finally you go for that the low hanging fruit what's meant by that is like the easy tweaks that you can make to make the what largest improvements in the experience that's called the low hanging fruit just pull it off the branch you need and it makes sense yeah so having best practices for the research for the you know the tools that we use and for the user testing is is pretty phenomenal something else when I think about the the idea of best practices it really comes out through practice so so we can talk about this stuff all all day long and and make these really helpful videos but getting your hands dirty and and practicing will teach you these things through experience it will become second nature  makes sense
