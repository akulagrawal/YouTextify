hi everyone so I know this is probably a huge cliche %HESITATION since probably ever seen every single speaker says this but it's a huge honor to be here %HESITATION I was sitting in your seats about ten years ago which seems like not that long and yet quite a long time we just celebrated our of my my class the class of those six to celebrate our ten year reunion here like a couple months ago which is a lot of fun so it's really really great to be here  I remember when I was sitting in your seats and you know I had just come from Texas that's where I was raised and you know I've done some web design in the past but I didn't really know anything about Silicon Valley know anything about you know this kind of tech hub and what it means to like have a career here and start ups and all that prior to coming to Stanford and I remember you know sitting in the audience and listening to the stories of people who had kinda come before me and in particular you know Marissa Mayer and Jen Fitzpatrick and they stand up here and they would talk about kind of their adventures after leaving Stanford and all of the great things that they got to go and build and work on and I was just like wow this is super super exciting and you know now I'm excited to be here talking to all of you guys and %HESITATION hopefully sharing a couple fun stories along the way  %HESITATION so down as you guys heard I as as here I did my computer science degree my bachelors and my masters %HESITATION and I was also lucky enough to be a part of the Mayfield those program so how do you guys know about the Mayfield  okay so for those of you who don't know %HESITATION this is an awesome program that %HESITATION that is really about diving into entrepreneurship and SO one part of the program is that between you know your junior your senior year you go and get an internship with a start up somewhere in the valley %HESITATION and you know along the way we are as we're in turning out our respective companies were learning about entrepreneurship we're taking classes were doing case studies and %HESITATION it's it's fabulous it's it's awesome sought by Tina %HESITATION I a lot of fun doing it so I the time of the start of that I chose was actually Facebook and you know this is a little bit of a little the little cheating because in two thousand six %HESITATION Facebook was already about a hundred people so it was a start up but on the larger and of a start up and %HESITATION you know but it was something I was really excited to work on because it was a product that I and all of my classmates at the time you know used very religiously so I went there and I remember my first day at Facebook in fact %HESITATION I was signed up to be an engineer and work on you know some of the photos features and I had a mentor and her name is Richie at on the first day she said okay there's been a change of plans I'm switching jobs I'm not gonna be engineer anymore I'm gonna be a PM I don't really know what that means for you %HESITATION but let me you know introduce you to this part of people over here you know this is our design team why don't you sit with them and and you know like chat with them I've got to go run and so she left being in this pod with this group of designers and before that you know I I'm not a designer by trade I didn't really know anything  about design %HESITATION %HESITATION but I got to talking to these people and you know I sat about Paul I'd and lo and behold you know fast for ten years and and now it you know my careers in design and when I look back on it sort of seems really quite random how it happened %HESITATION but for me what was so exciting about design was the the chance to work in the front forefront and thinking about you know what are the people who are going through the experience that we're building what are they feeling what are they thinking you know how are they %HESITATION able to understand the products that we built and so to me that was what was super super %HESITATION fascinated about design and also wasn't that crazy because at the time you know the designers that we hired were also our front end engineering team so it's a little bit of both designing and a little bit of coding is back in the world where you know we were still operating with just websites so you just had to you know to some CSS and Java script and front page be and it wasn't nearly as complicated of an ecosystem as it is today  %HESITATION but we got to building and one of the first things I worked on was of photos and photo products I also remember one of my %HESITATION first big launches a couple months later which was news feed %HESITATION back in September of two thousand and six %HESITATION over the years I've worked on things like the Facebook platform %HESITATION and ushering in a bunch of applications built on top of Facebook %HESITATION including you know a lot of games %HESITATION back in the error of two thousand eight and two thousand nine I worked on profile and timeline to %HESITATION and I worked on you speed and today the team that I lead a we work on design for all of the core features of the Facebook application  so when you go on Facebook and you want to catch up with their friends you wanna share you wanna you know watch videos or you know join a group those are a lot of the things that %HESITATION my my team works on  so all that's sad that's a little bit of a intro into to kind of how how like I hear the thing that I I think has been the most fascinating for me as I have you know look back on all the things I worked on is you know the moment where and you're starting a project and you are thinking about you know here's this awesome new idea that I have I can imagine you know how it's going to work and how people are going to use it and I want to build it right now and you know you rally a bunch of other people together with you and you guys are all excited about this idea that's how everything happens right that's how any idea ever sees the light of day  the question that I found super fascinating is how do we know at that point in time whether this is an idea that's going to be successful how do we know at after it you know it's all set done and we worked our our nights and weekends and we've gotten out to the world that will actually be something that people find valuable and that they'll find it easy to use and that they'll find well crafted  and you know being out Facebook we've had our share of features %HESITATION some of them have gone on to be a great success and some of them that haven't and a lot of times at the beginning you know there's there's it feels like there's really no way to tell feels like you're you're kind of rolling the dice little bit and this is the thing that I wanted to really study and and you know kind of reflect on over you know all of the different products that we built %HESITATION is what we're  the patterns for the things that were successful are there ways that we can tell as we are building whether this is something that's that's going to work or not  and %HESITATION what came out of that you know and a lot of discussions and a lot of post war and that a lot of just looking at the things that we had built was a framework %HESITATION of just three simple questions at Facebook %HESITATION that we now use to to ask ourselves whether the things that we're building feel like that there on  and there are three very simple questions %HESITATION because you know it wasn't going to be a manual that everybody was going to memorize and understand what is three questions that we wanted everyone at Facebook you no matter what their role was or what they worked on whether there were engineers are designers are product managers to keep in mind and you know when they're having a team meeting or whether we're reviewing the product or whether you know they're actually just talking with a colleague about an idea to just think of these three questions and ask them and to make sure that we have really really good answers to these questions so that's what I'm gonna talk with you guys about today  so the first question is is the most basic and the question is what people problem are we trying to solve  and the key word here is is really the word people because of course whenever we build anything we're trying to solve the problem  but what tends to happen is that you start to think in the mentality of your team or your company and you started to say things like you know the problem we need to solve is that we need to optimize the click through rate of our page and  you know you'll hear things like this all the time you know fall down and and small ways and in large ways and that that's not a people problem a people problem as we define it is with the go out and you talk to someone on the street and they were to articulate a problem that they were having  that's how they would say it you know that is the people problem statement  there's there's a couple things that we look at to make sure that you know this is a valid people problem statement the first is that it needs to be %HESITATION human and straight forward so we're not using words like CTR we're not using words like optimize or you know it integrate like these are not words that people on the street with news you know these are not words that people who are outside of the tech community are going to use to talk about their problems  the second thing is we want to make sure that IT solutions and gnostic a lot of times we start problems by saying I am going to build it after that blank or I'm going to design a website that blank and already in that statement is is it inkling of what the solution is but what if you know it apps not the right way or what if it's not supposed to be a website so a good people problem statement gets away from you know trying to already constrained it into a particular solution  the third thing is that it it shouldn't be about you know %HESITATION you know we'll Facebook or your company or your team or whatever winning and I think classic example is if you say you know our service is going to be the best at blah blah blah a person on the street doesn't care of your service is  the one that is the best at that they just want to know Hey for this problem that I have what is the best solution so stating any problem as like we you know our team our company whatever wants to win is is not getting close to to the things that people actually want  the first thing is that it gets out the why so you know sometimes you might have a problem like people aren't you know %HESITATION discovering this page and that is a problem that when yourself but it doesn't go one layer deeper it doesn't get out well why you know what's what's actually the root cause of why people are discovering this page is it to hidden for them is it too confusing for them to find like you've got to get you know to not just what is happening but what is the reason why it's happening  and finally a good people problem statement can not just you know solve functional problems like like a confusing flow but could also get out emotional or social problems sometimes people just want to feel like they belong sometimes people just want to feel like they're validated those are things that also constitutes you know %HESITATION something that that that when you ask people they might they might say  so let's look at some examples  so earlier this year I had the privilege of attending the %HESITATION mom's two point oh summit and this is a a gathering of a lot of influential bloggers and %HESITATION %HESITATION journalist who you know %HESITATION our mothers and who talk about you know parenthood and those topics  and so I got a chance to meet a lot of the attendees and be on a panel with with some of them  and one of the things that are heard over and over again %HESITATION was was basically this and this is an example to me of a people problem statement  I want to talk about an interest with other people who are also interested but I don't know where to find them and this is especially relevant at this conference because a lot of times what would happen is you know you're a new mom and %HESITATION baby you know you're in your front in your friend group nobody else is having babies around the same time as you but the same time you know there's so many things that goes through your mind you want to know it like is this normal My Baby just did this like should I be worried if you know what are some resources you you want to have like a community of other new moms to be able to talk to and so a lot of times you know women %HESITATION will will not know exactly where to find though that community and if they're lucky you know friends or other people say Hey there's you know a local %HESITATION you know group group here or there's like a neighborhood moms group but this is something that a lot of people in the audience were we're talking about a something that that was a problem to them so this is an example of a people problem statement  here's another example this one we've heard over and over again %HESITATION ever since we introduced the like button on Facebook everybody would ask why don't you guys have a dislike button and that would be one of the the top most requests that we've had for for years and years but you know that's not really a people problem statement at that sort of just a suggestion of we dig deeper the reason why people wanted a dislike button is frankly because not everything and new speed is likable you know people write about of hard times that they're going through tragedies that are happening %HESITATION and their live  in a recently we just went through the selection which was a very very charged and you know people would read things or say things that made them feel a lot of different emotions not just happy once and so that is basically the people problem statement %HESITATION not everything in the seat is like a ball and I want to be able to easily express other things  and finally one more example %HESITATION so sometimes you know I call these people problem statements sometimes are not just problems in the way of like Hey you know someone going to bring this up as as like a hardship in their life that they want solved sometimes is just more of an opportunity or a thing that you know if you ask people if they wanted they would say yes  %HESITATION an example here is the the and the desire to share spontaneously and authentically right a lot of times we're going through you know a pretty cool experience and we might capture it at that moment and then an hour later grow and uploaded on Facebook but you know how cool would it be to actually had that experience live with our friends and our family  so that is an example of another people problem statement  so basically you know the first the first thing that we always ask is okay is do we have like a statement that is really about what problem we're trying to solve for people that's the first question  so now the second question is %HESITATION well how do we know this is a real problem  and by no I mean well what evidence do we have right is there a qualitative evidence that it is Sir quantitative evidence that we can look at and I highlight the word we all not because you know I think that they're like fake problems but but just because you know I think the  and to ask is is this a problem that is worth solving you know all of us have %HESITATION limited time energy resources money whatever to be able to to vote you know are are being into trying to solve problems what makes this one the one that we should pick out of thousands or millions of problems that are out there  and so this question is really about just making sure that the opportunity %HESITATION is is is something that is worth tackling and that we aren't just you know solving problems for ourselves individually but that we actually are are very %HESITATION aware of the problems that the audience that we're building for spacing  so for the example of groups you know I want to talk about %HESITATION I want to find other people who are interested in discussing the same things as I am %HESITATION the way that we've tried to validate whether or not this was a big enough use case was of course we went and %HESITATION we  %HESITATION talked to a lot of people but we also look at some of the data that we had so when we designed the group's product %HESITATION to start with we imagine that most of the time you know you would get invited to the group so I might start a book club and I'm going to invite some of my friends who like reading the same books as me and they know that that's how that's how we're all gonna know about the group so in our initial formulation of group that was really all about you know being invited to %HESITATION by somebody else who is already a part of this group  but one of the things actually that %HESITATION that some of the engineers on our on the group's team had hopped over the years with this little units called groups you should join in and so do some of you guys want to see that sometimes you are scrolling through your feed and you know this little  story will pop up and it based on you know what your friends have joined and groups in your community and %HESITATION groups are similar to things that we think you might be interested in you'll see some recommendations %HESITATION and and you know you can go in and explore them and decide to join them if you want  and you know we thought that this is just a small feature but really you know most of the inviting was gonna happen through %HESITATION you know the normal in by process only took a look at the data what we found was that actually a third that you know of of %HESITATION group memberships were starting to happen via this little groups you should join it which meant that there actually was a need and a desire %HESITATION already using this the tools that we currently had that people wanted to find things that they weren't explicitly being invited to that there were examples of all sorts of things that they wanted to be able to participated and see that they just weren't getting connected to any other way so this was I think good evidence for us that if we wanted to devote something you know a a larger solution to helping people discover groups that that was a worthwhile endeavor  we also talked to a lot of people %HESITATION a lot of different groups %HESITATION one of the the the folks who talk to reference this group called the fifth position moms group %HESITATION this is actually a S. one of the most active groups on Facebook and I I think something like one out of four doctors who are mothers in America are part of this group %HESITATION and one of my friends actually happens to be a doctor who %HESITATION just had a baby and so you know she was like enough to have %HESITATION one of her colleagues Attar to this group but she talked about how  meeting for was to her and she %HESITATION she would spend hours on this group every single week %HESITATION because you know these doctor moms would be sharing tips on on a kind of how to balance their work and and you know I had a %HESITATION really tackle a lot of the issues that come from being in that profession and this is an example of you know a group that that everyone who is a part of it finds a hugely meaningful but not everyone knows about it because like how would you know that that this thing even existed out in the world unless somebody told you  another example is %HESITATION you know I've recently you know attended our our ten year reunion and at the reunion I think a lot of people are using groups to coordinate events and meet ups and %HESITATION the biggest barrier is that like half of the people I talked to didn't know that these groups existed that there was you know a class of two thousand and six group and that there was a reunion group that there were you know groups for different %HESITATION dorms and who are planning their get togethers  and %HESITATION finally you know there are a lot of groups and I'm I'm a designer and one of the the top groups %HESITATION that a lot of designers in the community joined as this group called designers killed a lot of designers share tools and articles at the bread and other resources and every time you know I I happen to add someone because I thought about them is that you know that they might enjoy it they're always like wow I didn't know about this like that's the first thing that everyone I says I didn't know about this so all of this you know when we did our focus groups in our research we I was more evidence that that in fact we should be doing more to to help people discover groups  so we ended up doing was actually building a pretty simple discover feature  %HESITATION if you go to your groups tab %HESITATION right next to it they'll be a town called discover and you know we did our research on what we're kind what were the topics that people were most interested in so you can scroll through %HESITATION you'll see suggestions based on things that that you're ready are part of but then you also be able to go and browse by category and this is where you can find you know parenting groups us your photographer people to go %HESITATION you know on a photo ID trips with on the weekends or play sports with or you know joining a running group and these are all groups that are public %HESITATION and that actually want to welcome new members  for the people problem of not everything that I see a new speed is likable and I want to be able to express you know other %HESITATION motions we wanted to make sure that this is actually a problem that that you know many people faced in that you know the solution that we had would actually directly addresses  so we looked at you know %HESITATION we talked to a lot of users %HESITATION we had them go through their fees and describe to us you know for each story %HESITATION what with what was your reaction or the feeling you know sort of like a free flow %HESITATION tell tell us what's going through their minds as they're going to they're feats and you know a lot of times people would say well there should be more ways for me to just say something because what I like about the like button is that it's so simple and no I don't have to you know %HESITATION go in common and the keyboard comes up and have to like you know two handed the type something I like the fact that I can just %HESITATION in one Chester kind of scroll through things and then you know say that I like it but the only thing I can do is like and there's got to be you know other other ways for me to express  other motions  we also looked at up your whole help you how are people you know using how are people expressing that they don't like something today and we looked at %HESITATION the stickers that people are using and leaving us comments as well as the emoji and what we're kind of the most popular ones for you know how frequently were people just leaving a simple sticker or a simple emoji  and finally we looked at also short comments so we looked at how many comments were just one or two words and all they expressed was like awesome or like that sucks or you know a a very very short phrase that we felt we couldn't in caps like  so with all that %HESITATION you know we decided %HESITATION we looked at all the data we looked at were the most common emotions that people want to express and we just we design something that we felt was %HESITATION is sort of fulfilled that criteria being really really light weight so you can still do it at with one hand %HESITATION and one Chester it's not like multiple taps and we also you know taking all of the data that that we had gotten from what were the most common things that people in %HESITATION the common reactions that they had we we just we built %HESITATION the reactions product and so you just scroll through and %HESITATION we took the the top most %HESITATION what we can wanted it to be universal reactions and that are that's the options that you see in that tree  and finally for the people problem of I want to share spontaneously authentically in the moment %HESITATION this was interesting to us because you know we had the Facebook live product %HESITATION out for celebrities and we built it for celebrities and public  yours first because we talk to them that was something that they told us very directly that they wanted and it was something that they were used to because you know they live their lives in the spotlights and they're they're very used to going on to the red carpet and doing interviews and you know being broadcast live and it was something that they felt they could do to kind of connect with their fans a little bit more so this is something that we had out that you know they %HESITATION that that was that was only available to public figures  but what the interesting insight for us was well is this something that that that people one who are public figures you know as a something that %HESITATION people in the audience you guys me you know all of us %HESITATION would this be something that that non public figures would use and find valuable and that is the question that we set out to try and and %HESITATION on cover improve actually one of the easiest ways %HESITATION for us to do that %HESITATION was the you know just build it for ourselves you know we already had the code at that ran for a public figures and we just turned it on and we you know it's let's see if anybody at the office uses it and %HESITATION what their reactions were  and we saw actually a lot of really creative ways in which people used it %HESITATION some people use it to broadcaster team meetings %HESITATION you know for people who are like working from home %HESITATION a lot of times when RBC %HESITATION programs weren't weren't working super well %HESITATION the other benefit is that you know you record the video and then it's available afterwards so for people who couldn't tune in live they still had a chance to watch the contents of the meeting  we also sell people just take it out for a weekend so you know they go to brunch on Saturday with the family and then they would go live and then you know people  hi man and there would be this conversation at %HESITATION the people who did this were like yeah it was awesome like I had a great time  and then we also saw people you know taking it for %HESITATION you know or run so so a team at Facebook was doing this really race and %HESITATION you know they wanted to %HESITATION other folks to kind of cheer them on and give them support so they went live in this is also like a super fun thing for for them and for all the people who participated so some in claim that you know Hey this could actually be something that that other people wanted %HESITATION and so what we did was we just %HESITATION we launched it to a small percentage of our users %HESITATION you know as as kind of a test to see if there were there was interest in the market  %HESITATION and and that was you know the Facebook live product %HESITATION on android launch on android first and %HESITATION right away we did see a lot of really really creative uses so one woman you know who's a tattoo artist was started to broadcast live you know I she was in the process of of tattooing somebody  we also us all a woman who broadcasted her her %HESITATION wedding life because she had family members who couldn't make it and you can travel the long distance  and you know it was a really really cool to be able to see how she could engage and interact with those audience members and almost have a feel like you know there were part of that experience  and you know I've had a lot of fun taking it out %HESITATION I I managed to get reservations %HESITATION to one of the best restaurants in San Francisco lazy bear and it's really cool experience because a chef stands up there and he explains every single dish and a kind of talks about you know all  the loving care that went into it you know how this dish came together and I just decide to go live in like a ton of my friends tuned in and everybody like I really wanna go does rest on too so that was really fun  %HESITATION okay so every says to the last question so let's say we built this we validated that it's something that people want %HESITATION or we think it you know there's enough reason to believe that it that it's %HESITATION you know something that is a real problem and that's something that is worth solving so now we build it and we put it out there but even actually build for the thing is out in the world %HESITATION in fact even before maybe we have a full prototype %HESITATION the question for us to ask is well how will we know if we solve this problem you know like what would the what would be different in the world %HESITATION what with that you know it's if we fast forward and now this thing that we've done is out there how will we know if we should be happy we should be excited if we think it's you know it didn't live up to expectations what exactly should our expectations be and I think this is a really really important question to ask up front %HESITATION too often what ends up happening is we have this idea and then we build it and we launch into the world and then the results come in you know we're looking at like the dashboards were looking at how many people are downloading it and what they're saying and you know there's tons of data points that we're trying to you know %HESITATION interpret and put together but it's hard at that point in time to then be very very objective about did we solved the problem because a lot of you know our natural inclination is to to read  into the good things that people are saying and to kind of consider all of that effort to have been worth it right and that that there's biases that kind of calm from when you know you're already looking at data and you're trying to interpret whether or not it's good or bad it's much better before you launch to have figured out you know what constitutes success for you so that you can you know go into the launch with that understanding and that's results come in you can map it's to your previous you know this was my criteria for whether or not %HESITATION we solve the problem or whether this was successful  and so what we do here is we want to make sure that we set measurable goals and metrics %HESITATION and measurable is really key measurable doesn't always mean like numbers or data but it does mean you know %HESITATION there's a a criteria where if I did this thing and I got this result I know what to make of that results  so for the example of groups I know we %HESITATION wanted to help people solve the problem of helping them find you know other people %HESITATION and to talk about their interests with we ended up building a groups discovered dashboard  %HESITATION what the success look like for us so before we launched we determined that well if we were successful at at at actually helping people solve this problem we would see that more people are then discovering you know groups that they're interested in and joining  but not as joining because I know I could make a giant button flash and make it red and I'm sure more people click on it and more people joined like that doesn't really count right what really matters is that they join these groups and these  groups are actually meaningful to them which means that if we you know fast forward a couple months three months let's say and then we look back these people are still using those groups and they're actively engaging meaning there you know talking with other people and their reading that the content there sharing content there liking the commentary you know we want to know that people are joining groups that are actually valuable for them and that there's that they're spending time on so that was actually the more important metric %HESITATION was %HESITATION nachos joins but meaningful joins  of for the the the example of you know I wanna be able to quickly express my feelings about a story but not everything is likable you know we launched reactions and prior to launching reactions we wanted to make sure we we %HESITATION measured a couple things if we were successful here then what we should see is that while people are using these reactions and not just using them you know it's not it's not good enough it like all the people that were previously you know using a sticker %HESITATION or an emoji or short comment then converted to using reactions because then it's disks for a one for one trade right if reaction was actually more light weight we should see more people using it that then the previous set of people who were using %HESITATION all of these other tools so that was really important to us  so I was kind of the first thing that we looked at %HESITATION the second day we looked at was %HESITATION we want to make sure that every reaction did get a fair amount of usage across different markets and this is important to us because you know  in the beginning even when we started to design reactions we had you know considered lots of different options you know we've considered you know maybe maybe a few funny if you know you were at like %HESITATION you know you like an awesome button or you know like like there's a couple of tons of different things that we could have put in order to make it more expressive and the reason why we distilled it back down to six is because we wanted to make sure that it was simple to use and if you were going through and choosing from like a grade of twenty suddenly it you know it's doesn't feel that my light weight anymore it feels like you have your pulling up interface and you're choosing something and it's gonna take more than a couple taps to get you to to what you want so it's really important that we %HESITATION nailed in and got to a really really small sets about that we picked the right set so we want to make sure that these words universal and it wasn't like you know %HESITATION people in certain countries were using you know certain ones more or people certain demographics were favoring others because it was %HESITATION a more information things we want to make sure that these were actually %HESITATION things are expressed %HESITATION you know the emotion people wanted to to express and all of our different countries and in all demographics  and then finally we want to make sure that the experience was good for the receiver so if you you know posted something and then you got a bunch of reactions did that make you feel bad did that make you feel confused you know was it %HESITATION %HESITATION you know like did you not know what was it like going on or did you just feel like it was a negative experience that made you want to share less in the future that was also really important and that was actually one of the reasons why we never a straight up you know put a dislike button  because this like in of itself can be very ambiguous and my disliking the content that you posted and my disliking Q. as a person and I just not agreeing with your point of view %HESITATION and so you know in all of our %HESITATION our research understand it just like we knew that it was something that people were going to get confused by and wasn't going to be a great experience so when we launch reactions we simply wanted to make sure that that that wasn't the case that the you know a motions that were being expressed felt like they were adding to the posters understanding of of what %HESITATION what their friends and an audience had to say  %HESITATION and the finally for the example of I wanna spontaneously and authentically share in the moment  %HESITATION what we decided to measure and look at was that you know of course people were broadcasting but again it's not just that they broadcast once because that's something that you can you know make happen by doing a ton of promotion and by putting a front center you know if you just you know if people will try a lot of things once because they don't know what it is what they think it sounds exciting the true test for us was when they had a live you know they went life and they had that experience did they like it enough to go and do it again you know that is the key that tells us we build something that is valuable and that's worthwhile because people come back and do it again and do it again and and you know they'll fill incorporated and make it a part of their lives  the second day we looked at is we want to make sure that well if you know maybe if you find a broadcasters loved it maybe you know everybody wants to go live all the time but is it really  a good produktivnost of watch you know what what people are broadcasting live right and then it sort of one sided and over time broadcasters are not going to want to do that because no one ever watches anything we want to make sure that the contents was actually interesting and a way that we can measure that was is the time spent watching live videos going up for %HESITATION proportion and and you know when we run surveys and other things are people saying that this is like a valuable thing that they want to watch  so to recap %HESITATION I whenever is kind of the three questions that we always ask in product reviews and %HESITATION you know any time we're talking about products %HESITATION we want to make sure that we we know what people problem we're trying to solve that it's very clearly defined that we can picture you know the audience or a particular person in mind as we're designing the product and that we're not solving you know problems for ourselves our company or our team but that were actually you know focused on %HESITATION an audience that had a problem that matters for them  second thing is just making sure that we know it's a real problem you know through looking at whatever quantitative data we have through doing focus groups and talking to different users %HESITATION understanding that this is something that that is a good a good use of time for us to to work on and to solve and finally being a very very rigorous about what does success look like and how will we know if we get a we put something out there and it did what we wanted to do and if not then we go back to the drawing board we learn what didn't work and we keep it a rating but these three questions have help to keep our teams folk  list on %HESITATION what matters which is ultimately the people that we designed for four thank you guys thank you very much
