welcome to the future you guys we are live today on Facebook and on you tube I'm so happy to see you joining me as always on our show is regular musical director Adam Sandler Adam how you doing today  I'm doing fantastic crest  three back on the show yes it is looking for to meet in the cruise so what you got  we don't want those great  okay okay you know today on today show we're gonna go old school like an old fool you know you guys remember this guy member this guy I hated yes this is Jose Caballero shot caller ID  what what Adam Adam does supersede beyond it sound effects here just relax okay this is Jose and those are the guys that are new to the channel you might even be aware that we used to be called the school and I thought appropriate to bring up this graphic I know you guys missiles say he's not back but maybe we have something even better and I oppose graphic because digging through my archives here this whole business model thing and the person who could is graphics on the show and she is none other than Nicole Johnson she is a US designer it's been a couple of years and she's flown the coop and she's been out in the field work  and I wanted to bring her back because you guys have been asking for more you extra content so it's taking a little while but we got %HESITATION Nicole and she's gonna be teaching us about  mental nude modeling that sounds like super fancy in cool and I she shared a little bit with me over lunch and I wanted her to come on the show it teach you a little bit in terms of how people how professional people are doing in the real world so you guys want to keep it real when they keep it raw Erika please do me a favor  no because you're locked into the containers don't hold yourself to go just a little bit longer I get the feeling today show is going to be off the chain it's going to be off the chain today you know what I was looking for a photo of Nicole and she's a little camera shy but in case you can't figure out who she is boom there she is with that super ground buffets look  you seem like really angry like just my face you don't have to be there yeah yeah no I was ecstatic actually  that's your stomach how exactly  all right so I had to dig around a little bit now apparently once you detach from Jose the mothership you stop posting on Instagram and Facebook could these photos are old I was work and look at it and I'm trying to find you in a happy space and %HESITATION it was it was kind of difficult to find well that's the thinking space that's  and then I found this on with you and Vincent this is fantastic this brings me back to the to the old days right this is awesome and then there's a there's a forced smile from you with %HESITATION it does say that it was a Sunday that was that was a Sunday mode so  yeah sending mode okay and his allies for a minute so yes we're taking down a trip down memory lane is this photo with everybody Adam are you in this picture I don't see you see I was asked to leave the picture  I said all the good looking people get in front of him I mean he will you push the shutter and right  all right yeah the volleyball picnic barbecue fish thing that we had done that was fun and  look in there is Nicole once and now she's got a big smile there now that's that's in a call I remember okay guys here's what I know about Nicole she is an original gangster firm the school back in the day she worked with us from two thousand thirteen in two thousand fifteen she's not passed away she's the living and breathing next to me right and some interesting fun facts she is a master certified diagnostician at Mercedes Benz and she was she's also Porter Rican an African American she played basketball basketball at saddleback college I'm having a hard time saying words today I don't know why ed she was also the director of marketing a buzz interactive pretty cool critical was the clap yeah there we go  you get one string  all right and you found in two companies pretty awesome and right now today you're at I con mobile and those two guys I don't know I called mobile they have offices all over the world how many offices do you have %HESITATION we have three in North America and three in Germany and %HESITATION smaller office in Shanghai actually in China okay so that's like a seven eight nine what AS graphic we're seeing here that is a map of our locations basically so that's our New York office there  it's kind of cut off but that's that's kind of a little map %HESITATION that's on our website of our different offices that we have okay and was digging around the website in case you guys wanna look them up here's something interesting somethings that you guys believe in that technology is an enabler not a driver integration is the key to success user experiences the joy use not only the ease of use I think that's pretty cool mobile is a context on a device and did you check out our super contractual homepage a man that's a something's you believe in the copy needs a little it was a prayer really really  the name of the father in  and you guys have worked on some really big projects and integration of technology news experience in consumer electronic devices as well as commercial things and maybe there's some things you may or may not be able to talk about but this is the stuff that's publicly available on the website and is the last one this one is really cool I remember visiting you in your office in Santa Monica and there's a real live prototyping mock ups there this is like a smart mere right it is it is going to tell us more about this thing because this looks pretty cool yeah I mean there is a there was a couple that I can't talk too much about but this was one of four or five we made I think this was like third generation and so %HESITATION we were working with %HESITATION Procter and gamble to kind of come up with some new concepts of what kind of the future of of the home the future of what your bathroom experiences like %HESITATION and so that trying to integrate you know things that are part of our everyday now that weren't part of the everyday when the bathroom was first created so that's kind of the the general ideas to try to integrate your your technical technology life into the bathroom okay well let's  talking let's get you on camera on it see your face those you guys I know this is Nicole Johnson I'm so happy to have you I'm happy to be here thanks for inviting me in and the reason why I wanted to have you on the show is not only because people are asking for more you X. content which were happy to oblige here you guys just relax we got her on is because we've been doing you access line but I'm always curious how does that  really big multinational company it's been doing this for quite some time do at the highest level how are you guys doing because I think there's a lot to learn so I think today you have some  exercises are some slides to share with us some slides with all right now was doing to just jump into it a little bit yeah we can't I mean it in before we do that I mean one of the things that just to kind of zoom in on what what we're actually doing %HESITATION but our team is doing %HESITATION you know on a day to day basis I typed projects working on the different offices have different focuses in so %HESITATION our team for example is made up of the team about seven or eight people and it's %HESITATION product experience so we focus and that's where you see things like world B. and things like that and those are longer tail products %HESITATION or longer tail projects that maybe go a year two years three years and we're working regularly with the clients flying to them and doing updates to applications and things like that so it's a little bit bigger are German offices also do some of that they also do stuff called service design which is you know maybe you're designing a new washing machine or a new style for things like that and clients like Bausch and and and those types of projects and then we also have our in card division which is %HESITATION also in Germany and a little bit in Detroit %HESITATION and they focus on automotive so our office has a little bit of a blend of everything plus we have as well %HESITATION  a kind of a full stack development team doing like data science and doing machine learning and things like that so we have like multi disciplinary teams and also Artemis I'm sick quite international people kind of come back and forth %HESITATION for different different projects which is fun now what I got a sense from talking to earlier was that you're you're working on prototypes and things that the consumer might not even see for quite sometime you're really far ahead right that's true that's true and a lot of the stuff that we're working on and and that's what's one of the most interesting things when you're doing these kind of our indie projects is it you can't talk about it much %HESITATION unless it's your team or you know you can't posted on your website and so %HESITATION you know even my portfolio I have wanted to update but there's certain things I can't put on there and that's okay and you know you kind of as you grow people can see what you're working on overtime three years four years down the road it might be until they see what you've been working on so it's it's fun and it's interesting on now and your current title I think recently you got a promotion solace a congratulations or the associate director user experience now yep the awesome feel good job congratulations so proud of you it's always awesome for me did to connect with people that have come through our doors in one way or the other and it's it's I'm thrilled for you and we have a lot both both you and I have a lot to think gentleman in particular Mr is like a baller for helping us on our way and I I remember asking you how do you get your position it can you you can you share the story yeah told me over lunch yeah I mean I talk about it I come mobile yeah oh yeah so I mean I had been here for two years and you guys are both going off into directions of coaching and teaching and I wanted to work on you know large scale projects and so I put my portfolio  there and I did a few interviews at places that were interesting and %HESITATION got a got a call from a recruiter asking if I was interested in working on a smart mir and and of course that sounds awesome and I went in to interview and %HESITATION turns out %HESITATION my director at the time the guy that %HESITATION interviewed me %HESITATION oz Marissa fender he had actually worked with Jose and so that was again like one degree of separation as it is in the design world especially here in LA %HESITATION where people know each other and so that was %HESITATION not how I got the job obviously you know the work I had done here was part of it as well but that was %HESITATION that was it I come mobile was a really good fit for me %HESITATION it's it's %HESITATION we have kind of a %HESITATION maybe one year old saying of keep icon weird so it's it's a really fun group of people %HESITATION both developers and designers and strategists and all the different people have amazing personalities and it's really fun to going to work every day just you're you're laughing at least a few times a day just on silly stuff and and that's fun yeah and before we go too deep I just want to make sure everybody knows the entire cast and crew behind the scenes in case they don't wind up saying something as as usual Erica's back cutting that's why the show super smooth have bothers them Hey guys and did a great job of stepping into helping us out and the man that you can just see is delusional and think ahead and show us your your new due to look at what you chose to do turned turned inside a little bit  zero man but my son is trying to go man but is it your name in the man yeah you have a man by and so now you're going to be his new hero so Aaron's gonna be munching your comments on Facebook and you to  mark is slipping in and out in terms of making sure I mean focus the lighting is good if I get too shiny here I might put on my hat there he is Larkin chairs all right now that's the whole group let's dive in enough teasing content dental modeling  what is that about okay so let me put one thing in context so we have projects that we work on and we work with this model called the double diamond and it has typically five phases double nine double diamond and its research discovery definition design and then delivering whatever it is that you made and with in that this mental modeling kind of fits and so %HESITATION this is you know kind of %HESITATION is a mental modeling exercises that we've massaged mental modeling as with a lot of other U. X. tools and things you'll hear it's it's not new you can you can Google it and you'll find lots of information on it %HESITATION but this is kind of our take on it I guess if you want to put it like that okay that you went too fast for my little no no problem research discovery design %HESITATION research discovery definition definition okay a definition design okay and then delivery okay perfect I got that in there mental mauling fits in somewhere between research and discovery and and it's it's I'm an explain what it is and then what we actually do with it and why are %HESITATION can I go ahead and yes it is all right cool so I'll be taking notes yeah you guys hear me could be clocking on a keyboard that's what I'm doing okay  %HESITATION not texting on no I'm not I'm not working on my tender okay cool all right %HESITATION so a mental model is is essentially %HESITATION you know the way a person might  eight assume a system works and when I say system it literally could be anything it could be a door a chair a bottle of water it doesn't really matter could be an apt but it's how they're perceiving that this is supposed to actually work %HESITATION and it's it's %HESITATION  these are things that are formed from a person before they even get to the point where they're realizing what they like and don't like about something so being that you ex designer as many of you probably know year your part designer your part architect your part detectives your part psychologist researcher scientist whatever you're a little bit of everything with the exes and I think that's why a lot of people find a home there because there's so many different facets of it you could do %HESITATION and just from that kind of psychological standpoint we're talking about users and what a mental model is it's it's based on different levels of a person's kind of latter if inference and there's things that I'm observing %HESITATION once I observe something I add my own meaning my personal meaning where I come from my background %HESITATION and this sounds like it's it's really big but it's not it's just these quick snap judgments that you make based on how your mind works %HESITATION I make assumptions based on data I've added date I've added meaning just anything familiarity that I have drawing conclusions I adopted believe about how something works whether it's easy or not for example and then I take action based on those beliefs %HESITATION and how it relates to you acts so there's kind of six main pieces when it comes to mental modeling if you translate that of like how a person's mind works how that translates into you ex and you have Ford Ince's it which is how something appears to  meaning think about a door handle or a light switch if you see that it flips up and down you can kind of assume how it should work %HESITATION simplicity of something you know how transparent is that how easy does it appear to use right away %HESITATION and when it comes to my level of from a familiarity with something have I ever use something like this before is it and that's why you have a lot of these templates for you accent and buttons that you know they they should be this big and what not and that's part of that because how people's minds work they begin to adapt to certain things and that's why certain user experiences take things forward into the future and some make things more complex just unintentionally %HESITATION and availability when it comes to something like how much cognitive load are you putting on a user to understand what it is that you want them to do %HESITATION how flexible is something %HESITATION can you can you use this this bottle of water can I understand it can I understand quickly can I you know open it anyway I want to open it you know maybe yes maybe no and so making sure something's really flexible for example %HESITATION  and feedback so do I understand that what I'm doing for example if I turn a light switch on and off the lights go on the lights go off that's the feedback just giving like a really simple stupid example %HESITATION  and then mental modeling is just part one of where we're trying to get to so I'm not mapping it right now to this double diamond I'm just talking about overall progression of what you want to get too when you're when you're designing for something so mental modeling is a tool %HESITATION and then you're trying to get to a conceptual models you're gathering information and that's a modeling and this exercise is just a way of gather  information and ideas you're trying to get a conceptual models so that you can have some ideas of how an avocation might be don't get too detailed about how it should work exactly just yet but just general ideas maybe something moves from left to right maybe up and down and then you're getting to the interaction models and the wire frames in the detail %HESITATION and that's kind of the progression of what you're trying to do  who else heady stuff my goodness yeah okay %HESITATION our audience and do you have any smart questions yet Erin %HESITATION day knowledge just a Lotta intro stuff hello is it going okay yeah that's fine so keep going then let's tractor sized truck room when one maybe Chris could you reach out for us people maybe or the people out there that we're listening  you know what I I'm trying but she went so fast and I was trying to take notes there is so I I can't do the recap yet faithfully so let's just I'm a little deeper you guys know I'll do the show recap and I'm writing notes here so what we'll get back into it so let's keep this light up for a little bit of a wait wait let's just hit this really quickly it so affordances is this how things appear to you this is how things would appear to a user and it could be any user it doesn't really matter what the system is the system could be an apple laptop something functional in the world is just literally how it appears to me personally based on how I perceive the world okay and then even be anything anything okay yeah I could apply to people as well it's like how how think how I think something should go and we all have that how I think when I when I pick up this phone what should happen when I turned it on it should turn on right or it should take me to my keypad to punch in my code or whatever right okay expect so there it's about expectations on  okay want leaders use the word affordances just call an expectation Hey these are you X. terms that you see all over the place right and one of the most interesting things about you axes that you hear all these these fancy terms this because they're all over the place okay and once you actually simplify the men to yeah it's just how it appears okay how I think that should work well check out the irony of this is the second one is called simplicity right it is and is that how easy it is it is yeah day out so we need to simplify we need apply to process to this process essentially right get out and I understand the term though I get I get it so we're gonna get educated you guys gonna learn how people in you XPW X. and sometimes we talk about this as using jargon or slogan that's Logan %HESITATION jargon and inside baseball kind of talk that's okay this is an education platform gonna try and teach you few new things familiarity that's sounds like what it is right by his house and %HESITATION there am I with this interface or whatever it is I'm doing what is availability about %HESITATION it's cognitive load like how much how much mental work do I have to do to understand whatever it is that you made and how it works how it's supposed to work I'm what did you mention work like what is that so if I ask you if I build an app and I put it in front of you and it has %HESITATION a menu toggle five tabs three buttons and I ask you I need you to order something on this and I give it to your going to have to think quite a bit as to what it is that this app is supposed to do and how I can actually accomplish my goal which is ordering something right so when you add more complexity when you add more elements and complex navigation and things  center is supposed to be implied but they're really not you're adding more cognitive load and make someone less likely to want to use whatever it is that you're making model okay that's good I think I got the %HESITATION the recaps and again I think that's it and the flexibility what is flexibility about again %HESITATION it's the ability to have a few different ways to use the system so that it's kind of like I don't say fail safes but it's if I you know if I hit a button here and it takes me to the wrong place there's always a way to get back or I can I can kind of move within whatever system or app or whatever it is in a way that is obvious to get in and out think of like a door and I've been using these doors and switches example is an exam the physical world yeah like if I were to open the door there and push it with the handle and then I turn around to get out and there's no handle like that's a problem right so there's no flexibility in the system there is there should be kind of something on the other side so that I can open the door either way whether I'm going in or whether I'm coming back out that's a really stupid example that's a great metaphor  I got I got it I got one in ink you so Erin as always I I love having aired on the show because he's going to just ask the questions that are general audience is going to ask because they're not steep and all this kind of stuff so here's my thought it when you said flexibility there's it sounded to me like they're multiple ways of doing something so it's not just like you're locked into one option right so I wrote on the word options and so let me see if I can reflect back what you said and tell me if %HESITATION inaccurate or I'm not getting the idea here in Photoshop there's like ten ways to cut out an image you can use a pencil the lasso tool the smart one tool you can use channels you can paint it out yourself with the brush there's like ten different ways and the more complex systems are like my %HESITATION or symbol for  he is like a lot of different ways you can make the same thing right and it's giving the user a lot of options so you want to go this path because you prefer this or you prefer to do it in in some other kind of procedure those tools are available to you exactly exactly right you did and there's another thing when you're looking at %HESITATION this the flexibility and simplicity happen to be across from each other which was just by accident but in fact if you kind of put them on a scale the more flexibility you give the more potential for error right %HESITATION if you have ten different ways to cut out something you know maybe you're using the less efficient option of Brighton versus giving two options are maybe three Max or something like that you're kind of defining that a little bit better flexibility is good but sometimes it can also be a double edged sword right %HESITATION it's that's the %HESITATION was I called the something about choice there like when you're not choice the paradox of choice thank you I will give you a Ding on that too has got you guys may or may not know this I feel like I'm in jeopardy  cool I'm gonna get you happy with the little dinner here look you guys maybe in another  I'm a fan of west world and so we don't have Jose in the studio but %HESITATION you know he was he's like his spirit is he he's like saying so what do you say how's it  one of the things  it's actually very faint and we need to boost up the whole the Jose volume on the on the bat and there's just weird creepy whispering now at this weird with sorry  it sounds like a like hunting yeah Sir okay let's continue on then me back what is feedback about again  I'm so  anything from a light turning green when I turn on the TV you know you have TV as you have the little green light little red light it lets you know it's on or off and if it ever broke and you realize the green lights not turning on you know something's not working the way it should be and so giving giving a a user some sort of feedback that they've done something correctly it could even be like %HESITATION I've ordered something to get me a check box of freezing freezing apps as an example and it lets me know it got ordered right because if you hit order and or add to cart or whatever and it didn't give any confirmation you're like I don't know if it worked right  okay yep that's perfect because sometimes I cement and my email to something I hit and doesn't say anything yeah so I hit it again again again the X. and allow for email things in my in box because you don't get any feedback no feedback okay perfect night I think that was excellent thank you for recapping you have already in the show and hopefully you guys have a better understanding about let's keep going as to the exercise all right  so with a actual exercise in a in like an actual project the goal is to get to %HESITATION some definition of features or use cases and there's there's a difference between %HESITATION  I have a new idea and there are some examples out in the world or have any idea and there's no examples of it out in the world verses %HESITATION I plan to have something that they want redesigned so those are some distinctions between this and the example I'm giving now is a client that maybe wants something redesigned and you're really trying to understand what their users are doing now %HESITATION and and their industry and you're kind of a guy  leveraging leveraging their knowledge  and so the again the objectives are to learn how users perceive information within the context of a project so let's say you're building %HESITATION and apps for traveling or something like that %HESITATION so your understanding how different uses for Steve information your understanding what an easy system you're trying to understand what easy system which could or should contain and again trying to identify potential features and use cases you're doing it in a way that it's structured but it's free flowing enough to it to get lots of ideas and interesting insights %HESITATION through kind of conversation  so when it comes to who needs to be in the room for this this isn't just a design team of U. action you I designers I mean you could do that with your team to maybe ahead of a client meeting by having the actual clients in the room when this happens is a lot of fun it gets of them engaged there are part of the process along the way and it gets you to kind of be a listener like a fly on the wall because they're having their own internal conversations about X. things that happened before things at work things didn't work and so it's it's really interesting and %HESITATION in the vein of kind of Jose %HESITATION you know out his favorite tool is there a favorite tools the post this stick and the sharpies and a white board or a pad for a disclaimer I know I didn't including expo markers here but I don't mean to write it with a sharpie on the white board just saying just in case good %HESITATION  and so so basically there's there's these core components within the exercise so we talked about mental modeling as a concept but now I'm just talking about the exercise and how we kind of work with the client  work with a team to extrapolate information and what we're doing is analyzing tasks of what's their users might be doing so let's say if it's a if it's a travel app or the travel app for road trips or whatever doesn't doesn't matter you're kind of analyzing what a day in the life of their users are doing and this goes hand in hand with actually talking to people it's not a solution for or a substitute for actually talking to real users it's just something to go in conjunction with to to get into a little bit more detail because when you're talking to users there only able to give you as much information as what their regular days like and you talk to twelve of them twenty four eighteen and you realize that maybe a few have similarities but really just breaking down what there every day is like %HESITATION %HESITATION that's that's really the main point of of that tasks part and then you're looking at gaps and when when it comes to gaps is now not really fully needing to tie every task to a gap but thinking about in the process of going on a road trip what are some gaps in in the experience of I get into my car I have to pack a bunch of things maybe I have to look up traffic and weather before I got on the road maybe somewhere I've never been before so there's all these gaps and things like that of of how right now in its current two thousand eighteen version of going on a road trip who might have some things that could be better they're not terrible but they could be better you're taking an inventory of that and then the third step of that is opportunities cell after you've kind of gone through out the day and the  and you've gone through some gaps now it's the fun part really where everybody gets %HESITATION gets to kind of go full like whatever it is that they were thinking up any of the ideas and teen their mental cop to quote Jose and really think about how future systems might work we're not putting a time line on eight or ten years or five years we're just saying any cool ideas that you think could work %HESITATION and to give one example of what this might look like %HESITATION in terms of %HESITATION analyzing tasks letting go through all of them because I mean you can kind of %HESITATION we can talk a little bit more about this but essentially going through tasks if you're talking about a road trip to apps for example for talking about travel road trips %HESITATION what I need to do before I'm taking off while I'm driving when I'm part is there any miscellaneous things that don't really fit into any of those categories and so what you're doing is you're doing this on a big white board hopefully ideally %HESITATION and you're having the client due to the writing you're doing some listen you add a few here and there if you have some ideas %HESITATION but for the tasks you're really getting them to empty their cops and tell us you know what other users doing and it also gives you insight as to whether or not how how well they know their users %HESITATION and so that's that's that's the analysis of tasks part the gaps part is even more when you need the clients is because they know their industry and they know their product and where it's succeeding and where it's not and so the gap section there's basically three three versions of what we see here one for analysis one four gaps and one for opportunities and %HESITATION you're basically just going through this and this exercise take  probably anywhere from an hour and a half to two hours depending on how talkative the team is and they're deliberating amongst themselves and with us %HESITATION and then what we're doing after that %HESITATION is is doing affinity mapping and so we're stepping back and looking at all the stickies %HESITATION and now we're starting to group things together and we're starting to identify these categories of things that are %HESITATION potential similarities when it comes to tasks potential similarities and items that are all related for gaps and same for opportunities and then from there you can start to figure out what features or use cases and keep in mind the distinction between a feature a use case is is not that far off a feature is kind of the umbrella and there might be multiple use cases within a feature that kind of define %HESITATION more specific instances of how something should work %HESITATION and this is this is essentially the exercise this is this is what we do and it ends up being a massive wall of sticky is but everybody is super colorful super fun everybody enjoys it and feels like they've been heard and have the opportunity to kind of %HESITATION voice their their thoughts  wow okay I can go back well I'm do we okay that's do you understand how to do this can you be you X. expert  the school is  it is to get out here you're like give me a job that I come over  he'd a junior associate director of user experience that was why not why not  what about what you learned reflect back so basically you ask people  like in the bathroom the bathroom example like what do you do in the bathroom and try to find holes in my routine that maybe %HESITATION are not super convenient or whatever and then you just try to plug that hole with a solution  to make my whole bathroom or whatever experience a little smoother has pretty succinct that's pretty good yeah number though yeah yeah I know I'm not on talking  that's what I think every single day on that though with exercise like when I was looking for to like breaking down some process and why didn't want to go crazy deep so this is we can talk about the process itself though if you guys have questions Holland yeah before we  I I believe you should let me call direct her exercise their workshop right so there's some questions or any people asking is is going to be available on slideshare nickel nope no pressure  that I mean we could possibly put this on Fletcher okay must be up maybe something you guys that you know I don't beat me up in the streets if you see me if I did yeah yeah exactly you guys come on pay attention I will take notes right now we're gonna do okay should feel honored that people actually want this I know that's a great  alright let's keep going  all right so when it comes to kind of other other things that we do with clients this is like literally zoom in to one specific exercise it's not it's not something that I could say this is you X. it's literally and act in a project over the course of a year %HESITATION doing this you know maybe in months months three or four %HESITATION after you've kind of gotten to know the industry after you've gotten to know a little bit more about users and really what you're trying to do everything we're trying to do  you when it comes to these exercises and this goes back to what I was saying is online you'll go and you'll look up you acts and there's there's like  three million different terminologies and ways of doing things and this is just our interpretation my interpretation and and ways that it made the most sense to be able to get information from you know from users get information from a client  gather and synthesize ideas and then turn it into something within a certain time line and that's really what we're trying to do and there's a lot of terminology from my own perspective when I %HESITATION when I first started where you know either you know even Jose you know early on was using terminology or kind of  riffing on experiences from the past and until at least my personality style as some of you might know is is %HESITATION I have to do it I have to do it  and set yeah %HESITATION good or bad and before I really can absorb it and I think sometimes when we're listening to like I'm sure the people listening to me talk right now they're like scratching their head or like I don't get it or get maybe I went too fast so sorry %HESITATION but not stirred on her own no no nice %HESITATION but yet but you know you hear all these terms and it's not until you actually are in a real life client scenario %HESITATION that you're able to really figure out what really makes sense so there sometimes it's it's like you know depending on your on this road is a UX designer and you have this toolbox and as you keep going down the road more stuff gets put in your toolbox and depending on the scenario after your toolbox  it's more full you know if you're doing something with a client that's the brand new project and your brand new product that doesn't exist in your making it from scratch okay I have to just have to pull a few different things for my toolbox to get more information or we know that this scope is going to be small and they already know what they want to meet you plot a few last things for it and that that's really what you're doing and this is literally just as you man and I don't want to spend too much time on this because it's it's just %HESITATION a zoom in on one one like very specific thing %HESITATION that we use as far as gathering information while we're doing throughout these phases when it comes to research again were out and we call it in the field but worked you know visiting locations where the users are %HESITATION if it's if it's drivers if it's whatever and work we're talking to them %HESITATION because you gather real worlds just absurd observational fly on the wall type of data from from them just watching them and you can ask questions here and there but coming back to to this mental modeling again it's it's just a it's a snapshot of a major like potentially year to year long project okay now before we do that I went to a question that you okay yeah we have a bunch of good question okay outlaw star and I will ping pong back in all right and then we'll get into it so let's see if this derails the entire conversation I don't care if he we got okay Justin Parker's asking is you X. the new money in the design world you could have a great brand that bad you acts and still not profit what do you think about that  I would I would lean towards Justin being accurate I wouldn't say that it it discounts any of the other disciplines them because  all the other disciplines like  they're they're all internal parts of of the process so %HESITATION  for example like our product experience team here we have you acts and we have you I and we have some motion designers and if I you know me and are you Eckstine design an amazing experience something we couldn't create you know the U. I. that goes with it but it's the collaboration with them that really makes something amazing verses you know you acts alone though I know that you know companies now especially is experiences have gotten better and easier to use that's like it's the expectation now verses the %HESITATION %HESITATION what's the word %HESITATION it's it's kind of the expectation verses like this new surprise right so if something back in the day was easy to use it's like wow okay this things easy to use but I still have to use this and this and this and that and all these different devices or whatever now X. experiences being simple fast %HESITATION that's that's the norm now that's not that's not a a new novelty thing all right cool nice Erin's next question next question what tools do you use to organize a lawyer like all this research you're doing like I don't have any clothes could you %HESITATION could someone advice  somebody's not most people aren't gonna like this one  so so I have I have been working a company that we are we're like part of a publicly traded to kind of %HESITATION organization so there's a lot of the cool new like organizational tools that we can't use so we do still have to  %HESITATION in some cases resort to excel which is tried and true %HESITATION like excel documents actually help us a lot  but but there's there's so many tools out there when it comes to %HESITATION when I would use for a personal project there's a new tool %HESITATION that I've been using for again just personal stuff called lotion and that has the combination of of a little bit of everything honestly like it's online the app is super easy to download and it's you can do to do lists and tasks but you could also do you know checking off tasks were within a project or sharing documents and files so it's %HESITATION it's really easy to use %HESITATION when it comes to just one little deeper thing of the question %HESITATION the types of tools that we're using ask the office are things like %HESITATION we're still using we use actor actuary is amazing as a you extol %HESITATION and for those who aren't as familiar with you know all these again policies for all the extra again %HESITATION actually %HESITATION eight X. U. R. E. there's as your which is for a development thing don't look that up it's scary %HESITATION no actually is this this tool basically for wire framing %HESITATION and also that you do like prototyping and it also if you're a kind of using a shared server within your office I can upload a new version of a document to my team no matter where they are they can check in my latest updates without having to you know zip a file and share that as well another one is keynote keynote is literally you know my one of my favorite tools would say it's it's  flexible it allows you to do a lot of different types of things even if you wanted to do some super super simple prototyping and keynote you can actually do that do some simple animations and whatnot %HESITATION and again for documentation of the heavy things like these mental modeling exercises or user responses from a testing session you're still going to need things like excel or some type of spreadsheet thing it could even be Google docs %HESITATION again those those cloud tools that we are able to use as much %HESITATION are useful for teams are working a part or again versioning control which is also a thing and design as we know final final final final and things like that so yeah so to reek of use keynote notion and maybe some excel keynote notion excel sure after %HESITATION gesture yep and well how come you can use all the regular cloud tools Google and normal people use mostly security thing because where we have sensitive %HESITATION client information and if that's on somebody else's cloud servers %HESITATION that's that's a breach of security base and I'd like to place it at my mean we'd we do have a you have to have clients like Procter and gamble Bosch Audi you know these large companies so that's that's not yeah name dropping name drops raining blames here  %HESITATION another in a program  it's a cool anyway it's all good and another good question real simple one man redeem myself and I really want %HESITATION if you're young graphic design college student on %HESITATION sorry what's one pieces sought advice for new York's guy that's from %HESITATION somebody shot all right as an asset she gets in the  okay want is a son of vice for New York sky  that's a great question  I would probably say something along the lines of a learning %HESITATION  learning the the primary steps of U. X. %HESITATION and for me %HESITATION I I did go to General Assembly in two thousand twelve as part of the first class in LA and that was really helpful for me not in a real world %HESITATION you know kind of we're talking about now what a large scale project what are all the steps but it did give me insight into a lot of this jargon and a little bit more time to absorb it as opposed to that when I was doing before that which was Lynda dot com videos and teaching myself certain things which was all fine and good but it was it was all theoretical and then that took me into tactical like literally what tools my supposed to use at that time it was like on a gravel actually %HESITATION was like super crazy expensive as a as a young designer you're not gonna buy after that's for large teams but on the graph full or sketch which is super awesome as well I don't use that as often anymore but that was a fun one %HESITATION just adding to that list of other tools %HESITATION they're pretty much saying yet you should go to General Assembly as a line saying you should go to some sort of small program to solidify some of the information and also be around like minded people who are also trying to learn different parts of you acts and through networking events could be products school could be General Assembly it could be any of these types of things that are out there doesn't have to be General Assembly interesting that's where I went %HESITATION but yeah I I would get I would try to get some some found  Asian in in what you axe is unless you've already done that and they make you look at expert like this even in the field for a while you're kind of maybe not an expert but getting close I mean could you share like a piece of wisdom just something like how you look at things you know or I talk to people or something like that that's actually really funny because when I was working with Jose and Chris I remember having conversations about you know it not being about %HESITATION when you're learning things from people like me talking to you right now is my you know my mind coming out of my mouth and telling you my experience but until you kind of where to sit with me and watch me every day working or talking to people you know without just giving advice or whatever you you start to get into the mind of how the person you're looking at thinks and you know when it came to like Chris and Jose I started to learn not what they were telling me that they were thinking which was important to but also how they're thinking about things %HESITATION it going back to again just the the General Assembly part or something like that and then the next thing would be to try to find a mentor and you know that that picture that that Kerr showed there was I think the day if I remember correctly that I went after Jose after about like three or four school events and I had gotten to know some of the people around and I just asked if he'd be my mentor %HESITATION just for coffee and things like that I was literally thinking that's all it be and then within a few weeks and ended up being an apprenticeship sell you know three months of an apprenticeship and then it ended up being two years of working on projects and traveling and doing you X. consulting %HESITATION about that six right here I'm talking about that I think that was the day I am pretty pretty sure  that was the day Sir remember that venue that was we work in %HESITATION somewhere I think it was we work in Hollywood I am quite Hollywood Connors and there it was really hot yeah there was in it it was you know that wasn't that was out of yours that is the case melting right idea is that the merge conference the right yeah exactly so so basically my point is is try to get some some rooms you know tactical you know training and you X. %HESITATION and surrounding yourself with people and going to events and and also trying to find a mentor and even if it is just the coffee that's okay too %HESITATION but getting that I'm you know place you can ask questions without feeling like you just don't know what's which way to go because again with you acts there's so many different things you could be doing from researched information architecture and until you really understand what those are talking to someone that does it eat and it's harder to make that decision about what it is you talk they want to do in the the bubble if you axe  question where were you before yes of course I I will hold your question can you hold your question  okay older person because this is a perfect time for Adam to play a little piece of music so I could you tomorrow yeah  we're going to go on and I'm  the government  perfect  you are asking for resources we have it as a resource is right here on this very channel and networking you guys go to the future dot com  you can check out the course I did you get the letter went together to help teach you user experience design that is it comes with a whole bunch of videos at a work but you guys might enjoy that it's four hundred eighty nine dollars it's not cheap but it's a lot cheaper than General Assembly which is that okay that is true four K. but this  so study thing and this is a go at your own pace now that might be too expensive for a lot of the guys and whose is also put together the U. X. master class which is a series of webinars he cut together and and people seem to love that so if you want to just explore what this is about maybe that's a friendlier price for you I definitely and I mean the the funny thing is is a lot of these things here  they were they were helpful tools they didn't come in like a perfect pretty package like you guys are like  super shiny and polished now but yes we are is our awesome tools all over this awesome they were awesome because they gave a practical foundation of how to like step by step talk to somebody and get ideas for get their ideas into something that made more sense because you step by step talk to somebody who yeah exactly %HESITATION out what figure what figure out what it is that they're asking for so if it's a if you're doing freelance you're sitting with a client one on one you got that I said at a coffee shop and do that brand actually to exercise you can do the persona development exercise with them %HESITATION through a Skype session or whatever you can also do this with large scale teams and that's why those tools I mean again they've they've grown and they've become very shiny and polished and I really think it's super awesome but the %HESITATION you know that that the foundation of them of something that I could take as a workbook and I can see and again this is why Jose and in the U. X. world is so so brilliant is that he's breaking it down to you step by step %HESITATION and you know this combined with a mentor which was kind of what I experienced is super helpful and %HESITATION that's kind of how you learn you have to do the same exact kids and a little bit all day yeah and on yet but it started with me doing a start up  crashing and burning not understanding you ex except for in theory starting to Google and dig and dig and watch actually way way way back in the day Jose on a start up what was a call this week in web this week in web watching Jose before I even met him on this week and wet and then you know kind of watching videos and then that translating into I should probably go to some sort of school that was my interpretation of it you don't have to do that and then it kind of was a an interesting journey okay I just want to say that %HESITATION somebody is a big fan of Erin today Rachel Jim so less be saying Erin's pretty good with questions today on the way there and well done with a clarifying questions big okay I know that %HESITATION questions Erika please what was your question  so my question was the  when do you include the U. I. designer or they there from the beginning  typically if we're referring to you know talk about this whole five phase process and sorry to bring a photo of the double diamond but %HESITATION this five phase process you're typically working in parallel starting about just after research and the reason is you know the US designers were the you know the you know designer scientist that want to go out and gather information and and put that all together and synthesize form and then wish were typically sharing that with the U. I. team %HESITATION and then they from there with that information start to get a feel for %HESITATION a feel for what it is that might work and they're doing exploration boards and things like that politically do three two or three of them and show them to to client and so after that happens from then on we're really working in full on parallel and with our team you know where we're sitting pretty much all together so you're  %HESITATION constantly %HESITATION working with tweaking or you know what we learned this needs to be a little bit bigger or even after usability testing you know we need to make updates and changes so it's it's really %HESITATION an ongoing thing ideally you can work in parallel sometimes it's not super perfect and we need to do a little bit more work before they can start but that's the typically were working together in peril  all right since the road in all caps I feel like if I don't say something heads are going to explode Ono okay so polio is asking questions again there's a little too there chill with the tude I'm a design with over ten years of experience I want to move into you ex and you I design  please give us advice do I need to go to go back to school to get a certificate etcetera and I think Nichols already given you a price she's answered as which is you need to get some kind of foundation you can go to many resources this General Assembly can learn some things on Linda but you got to get your feet wet you try things out but a great ways to go to conference and ask somebody to go out for a Cup of coffee just to get in there just get started doing this because the first time first couple times you may not get it right right in that the other question I would I would ask back I don't know if we're able to ask questions bachelor is %HESITATION %HESITATION what what makes you want to move into you acts from from graphic design I have the quote something in my head that a lot of %HESITATION graphic designers who are like pure graphic designers have told me %HESITATION but I would be okay to hear all right since we can't actually here I'm I'm going to play the role of the worst right we'll see it has a the errands on the look out for the the reply here Tracy of applies but I'm gonna guess that it seems like when you're in traditional design there aren't as many opportunities  it seems like if you move into the U. S. there are %HESITATION jobs in Silicon Valley high paying jobs and people are looking for more designer city you ex and you why so higher pay more opportunities maybe  this is true I also think there's a there's a personal spin on it as well that that is added to that as as people that I've seen that really excel in U. X. design and oranges masters at it are are creative and analytical at the same time and the ones that have that desire to move into you X. that's beyond just that the war the you know the high paying jobs which is also again a bonus is that the %HESITATION when it comes to is this read enough is this the right tone of it is it block  the the %HESITATION  I guess the subjective nous of of visual design in a lot of cases %HESITATION kind of it rubs them the wrong way and say want more tangible reasons as to why a design is the way it is and they're they're seeking out you X. even if they don't really know what they're they're being more logical as as well as they used to say Spock like and so %HESITATION that that's the type of person that wants to get into the system of why something works the way it is a really excels in you accent I don't see nothing you need to be a systems thinker but it really does help in terms of having slightly creative and you know like cool ideas but also thinking of systems and how you can take this big idea and put it into something that's that makes sense to other people well let's get back to I wanna make sure we have enough time to cover the rest of what you have planned for us and not to  we can we can keep battle of a no no I don't want to I slow one is because I want to learn from what you have and then we can address questions with whatever remaining time that we have to get an idea okay the send back in that's all the questions for a little bit you guys that are watching on Facebook and YouTube you can continue to ask her questions and Erin and myself will continue to pick through them okay let's do it yet so I don't have any more slides side we don't just talk no no no I want to just talk I think it's probably easier and people can ask questions that way okay so I like those three problems that you had in terms of tasks gaps and opportunities let's apply to something something that our audience can relate to let's do this in real time okay you want to work on your your your new one duplicate this light is it an edible thing or the impacts none now let's get into this I think this is a process so let's let's start with a blank slate yep that's okay what's that our audience right now what's a prompt that you want us to work on what what kind of situation a scenario nickel I want you to run this because I don't want to put I don't wanna do this the way that I'm doing I want to see how you do it now it's all fine to one direct them so so essentially what we'd be doing as let's say let's say we're making an app that would be for people that are going on road trips %HESITATION maybe it would be something that would help them to make going on a road trip with well and I had the drug you I don't want to do the road trip you're to give the road trip okay okay as you do something different can can you give us okay people on you tube and on Facebook give us a prompt a problem for us to solve yeah is that a tasking activity we want them to focus in on or you want to call you could maybe mention one that you're currently working on that you're stuck on and then we'll %HESITATION stuck you for free  well we don't I don't really have anything that I could actually prior but we can talk about something that everybody can relate to  just going to work driving to work could be that too you're all about driving aren't you  so the roads right number of the driving round trip okay so there's a couple things here it's amazing food delivery health homelessness app a personal assistant app let's let's get a couple more an escape room with super powers I don't know what that means okay but that's awesome right it is pretty awesome yeah yeah homelessness homelessness I'm sorry delivering coffee motivation to work out health care okay %HESITATION of those which ones which one makes the most sense for a motivational work I think motivational  I like that idea okay a problem so if we can work out so if we were to break this down into a few different kind of day in the life of of of person out what we're looking for is these categories so in this driving example that I've been giving in the reason I'm steering that way was because this kind of it Max out at the moment and this normally you're thinking about okay when it comes to working out %HESITATION what are what are the different parts of a person's day okay here's what we'll do Anne and I will be the client yeah and then we will participate in if you guys want to answer a long will also read the comments so we're to do this weird hybrid interactive school right now okay so here right back at you ready you ready improvised yeah let's do it so the the prompt here's a motivation to work out so Erin and I'm gonna be your Guinea pigs and you can edit this in real time right I am going to edit this I'm gonna go to full screen that can do that easily hides set up so this would be like part of like some kind of weight loss out where you somehow show me images or something to get me to want to work out it could yeah let's say you guys are clients let's let's put a little bit more yeah text to it right so you guys are a client %HESITATION that you guys have a fitness out it's been out for a little while  you guys are looking to maybe get more funding %HESITATION and for that reason you want to %HESITATION I knew when I screw that right want to improve it you want to address something that wasn't quite working with it that you want to get that next series series a round of funding let's say that let's put it in start up contacts this is excellent because he won't say we both Erin and I are the role models for the fitness app I don't because the working out all right let's do that so so analyzing users tasks what I'm looking for is at a high level these categories appear what is the day in the life of a person that's working out not everything they're doing when they're working out there there's literally their day so what is your days of like you get up in the morning maybe you have breakfast %HESITATION so early morning %HESITATION annual operation anything right so then that's a big thing yeah so let's do morning ma'am  but still afternoon to this day in the life this is Dan life does analyzing the timing is writing so you opening up to me much broader than just working out exactly okay these are things that they but they play into health and fitness right in your day in court of working I like that's that's %HESITATION no I'm not I'm not questioning your  yeah he is alright  no no no  track here go about on land you know Jeez that's not gonna happen  so so basically you're you're looking at this I may leave this miscellaneous column I like to leave this in here and the reason I like to leave this in here is that there's going to be these things that don't quite really fit in the morning afternoon evening it could be things you do late night or the things that just are just random as right could resume into that is there any way that this kind of clear that up yeah and you can  yeah see honestly that that's clear enough for everybody I got a black belt that you know you guys relax called third degree and so on so %HESITATION morning yet what are some of the things that you're doing in the morning you got to get ready for work you gotta do meal prep  what is what is meal prep entry grill or people who are really serious about working out they have to prepare their meals because you can't just run to a fast casual place and get the kind of food you want you I know somebody a crystal no used to work here he would portion out all these meals measure the protein and get all that stuff set for the day orderly extreme well I'm gonna say is into extreme I was thinking more like just have a healthy breakfast of like opening  that's there's no filtering here this is not brand attributes but it's kind of there's no filtering are we saying when we really do mean Chris we really do or things like Chris it making milk what felt that things you and I are business partners okay we have a fitness app to help to motivate people to work out  that's the role I'm playing right now exactly follow Aaron okay as a member I roll it yeah we're playing a role okay okay but I mean but in the in the vein of fitness you you do you exercise you are human and you would probably do some of these tasks right so you're either going to be talking through the lens of your user the lens of yourself and and clients do both right because they're either are whatever it is that they that was recently created a rap or whatever so it's it's something on profit all intertwined made so so you might be thinking about going to gyms he might be packing your gym bag as somebody suggesting %HESITATION just to make sure that you got the shoes on the work out whatever yep %HESITATION so that after you work out your gonna shower  yeah hopefully Erin yeah  but that all your all your bathroom stuff yeah yeah yeah and these are things that you're writing with a sharpie on a post it so it's not like lady things you guys are doing great here so Erin and I are like just flying through all the sharpies and the note %HESITATION the post it notes exactly writing a bunch of things there anything else you want to talk about in terms of you working on the morning %HESITATION I was just thinking that you have the same tools as like a fifth grader colored paper and markers they're amazing  think of the most fun time of one  okay your does anything  I don't know man  was your question again see this is a problem what do you do in the morning this is this is this is this is like real life this is all good this is fine so what what are some of the things that you're doing in the morning that are part of %HESITATION playing into health and and your fitness save have something's already so get ready for work that's totally fine we can leave that one in there but meal prep plays perfectly into that having healthy breakfast packing your gym bag these are all things that are %HESITATION could be direct indirect or just parallels of thing right are inter related to fitness maybe are also responding couple emails in the morning yeah yeah yeah  oops bad speller sorry okay the worry you ever even here that's right from as I I know it's all right we forgive you and now you're on the spot you guys anybody has ever been on the spot you somehow your spelling just doesn't work no this is even not on the spot that's no strategy I know it is okay I'd rather be honest rather be honest than to try to yeah all right so afternoon someone or some afternoon tasks similar to the morning that are inter related to your health  fitness it could be working out it could be  going for a walk you know to clear your head at work but you're also obviously exercising a little bit you get your blood pumping %HESITATION so we'll play going for a walk  we have a lot of our designers that like to to do that and we actually started a walking club so that's that's fun  all right so with some other things  I know this is gonna sound kind of weird now but  I know this that it's a lot to do with the lunch I have %HESITATION have a really big lunch or if the meal it if I don't eat the right foods at the right times I'll be too full or have way too low energy in the hungry to work out a low energy for the like manage my energy and food  okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna put low energy that's not tasks so early to manage my energy  or do we want to call it eat healthy  I mean that's a healthy breakfast manage energy  the sounds good yeah okay like that yeah okay what's something else in the afternoon that happens related thing you're trying to you're trying to get all your task done for the day I mean yeah I'm assuming you're at work you've come back from lunch they just trying to finish your your tasks yeah okay are you are you standing for work are you sitting in front of the theater  yeah  and for me sometimes I just need that extra jolt %HESITATION because after lunch you you have that post food coma thing other sale coffee some I'm looking for a little pick me up here TV me because of rare and yeah okay a drugs rather be  this is not the kind of mean since marijuana is legal here I'm sure a lot of folk in the cave in  that no part of this  okay I can I can I can do it in the vein of Jose smoke a bowl I don't know whatever you guys want to call it and  it's like no matter where Jose is in the world is spiritually  suffering from squirrels and drum yeah exactly yeah  only in appropriate things to talk about but let's keep on it's all in good fun so so coming back so now let's talk about the evening so in the evening are you what are you doing in the evening Stillwater your users doing okay evening what time are we talking about here yeah good question that's a good question myself six seven you know it's a six you know what we should put at work here as well okay you don't you try to do then potentially in the evening you try to get worked out so you can be traffic home but maybe want to go to Jim now that Jim time into the gym time yeah this is when it starts for me like I'm not going to go today and I gonna you should go and then so you're so so let's let's having an internal like yeah internal games there to four okay all right fair enough  but thou and I know when I talk to Iran forest he's not really there when I'm talking to him  it is a entered a lot I appreciated the distraction obviously  internal conflict what else you have going on in the evening are you going to the gym to be put that here yes go straight from work and trying to find the motivation to go to the gym yeah Netflix and whatever or just to eat for  do you eat before you work out see that's a that's why I was saying the timing of  in the mills is important business trip I got to have something like that six right before I leave or else of the two hundred %HESITATION work so quick snack yeah that's like an important not very important is that the life that has seven of energy  an important one make sense like the pre workout meal or whatever is that what you're supposed to do poll why would you know I'm sorry I'm going  right now it's like I'm I'm not a building this but %HESITATION we can talk to some users and  do some research %HESITATION okay so now and this miscellaneous calling doesn't need to be filled out is there anything that doesn't really fit into any of these that are kind of part of this your tasks throughout the day morning afternoon or I I got a good one from Nathaniel for the evening he's a talk about checking your workout plan %HESITATION old super good command genius who was there are too many comments Aaron instead of thinking about your internal dialogue he's having it right now it's now it's too early yeah a couple of people are saying they're the internal conflict of four PM is real yeah  it's so real so so what was that what can you say that again sorry I was yeah it's just talking about that thing about your work out routine workout plan  planning work out okay  and do we want to leave this miscellaneous blank is there any anything that came up that's that's good for that category  someone mentioned meditate on that's that is mind body that's good now  okay meditate I'm gonna put that  you could do that technically at any point in the day  so we'll put that here let's get  anything else  not to be the only one that's fine  I think you're dances be created here what are we thinking about miscellaneous anything else that's miscellaneous like meditation could literally fit into any point man in it doesn't really I know one is like when I look at my Instagram sometimes if I see like I don't know like a hot girl or %HESITATION do working out on my own and I should work out early %HESITATION social motivation and has a little bit of power over me if I see like a good image  social motivation and I get  I'm the same way  we have someone mentioned %HESITATION okay  anything else  what do I like a work out buddy having a buddy someone mentioned that  is that so like texting a friend kind of a thing chlorine I know if I had like a really both friend that was like for a let's work out right now I mean I might work out more  okay I'll call you one yeah I was gonna say Chris way that I will call you more often as your buff bro right so so we've got some interesting stuff here let's go big here so we've got in the morning getting ready meal prep answering emails packing my gym bag getting healthy breakfast in the afternoon we're going for a were at work then we go for a walk maybe after lunch you're sitting at your computer %HESITATION you're trying to manage your energy whether that means getting a coffee tea or smoking a bowl could mean anything %HESITATION in the evening %HESITATION you're still at work %HESITATION you're trying to get home you're having this mental internal conflict about you know we do I go to the gym or not or do I just go watch Hulu or Netflix %HESITATION heading to the gym %HESITATION that site needing motivation that heading to the gym  maybe having a quick snack somewhere in between %HESITATION and plan your work out so I didn't really put that in chronological order so forgive me guys okay %HESITATION your life in some of these meditating meditating or texting a friend to go work out with you as additional motivation or social motivation so I feel like motivation is an interesting kind of things that if we were kind of doing some affinity mapping %HESITATION here that would be kind of an interesting development here okay so in real life Erin and I would be working with the team lead the writing these things down on a post it note in the final and then you a prompt us that slop among the law yeah I literally just draw columns with %HESITATION which are columns with sharpies and put this morning afternoon evening so it's done very you know kind of relax and that way we're not forcing this kind of you know %HESITATION you have to do it this way we're just asking that they only thing we do ask is that we we give about maybe five minutes per column so we're not just everybody's putting stuff everywhere we're focusing on morning focusing on afternoon okay Sir time boxing in utilizing it but at the same time yeah exactly track okay exactly what's next up so the next step would be a similar thing but we do  do that gap analysis so same basic thing and world will copy paste this balcony over here so as I'm taking notes here are the task always a day in the life and that's what we're trying to get yeah the tacit don't because you're really you're trying to do this version of identifying what the users kind of every day is like without actually having these are necessarily sitting there either experience from the clients because they know their users or maybe at that point you've already done twenty interviews and you've also talked to people so now it's it's a combination of user interviews a maybe have tucked away  in a document somewhere maybe you've kind of documented that room but it's also now really just having some time to think like what are some other things that maybe we didn't hear from users that they really do but they didn't mention and so this is what you're really trying to do in this exercise is really kind of granular go through a person's day because when you can do that you can figure out where there's where there's reasons why maybe they would use your app at this certain time of day they don't have time or it's too complex if I'm sitting at my desk or in a meeting to plot a nap and check something or whatever and you can kind of come up with interesting ways to work around a person as opposed to trying to make the person work around the way your app works or the way your experience works whatever that means totally makes sense to me so let's dive into let's just do this real quick yep %HESITATION to get to keep the energy going here all right so what we do next so we're looking at gap so now we're still looking at the same time line  zoom in again here we're looking at the same time on him nothing has changed %HESITATION so morning afternoon evening except for now we're looking at in terms of you know my health and my fitness what are some things that aren't so great in terms of maybe it's me that I'm I'm not super motivated to do something or you know whatever act we have been and are you guys are our clients here whatever the apt is it it doesn't do X. Y. Z. E. or it needs to tell me this and it doesn't right now I need to tell me %HESITATION what my caloric intake is for the day before I head out so then I know it in my head I need to hit fifteen hundred and I can't go over that something like that and is this through the lens of the actual product that we make now it's to the product and then thinking about you know what we just did here %HESITATION it doesn't have to map one to one  so it's not healthy breakfast and has to map one to one but now thinking about the product right and I got it yeah I got it what if the the the app woke you up in the morning and just told you I can just tell you what to eat  okay hello healthy bowl a granola and a protein gel that he suggests Jennings yes so it's adjusting see see you guys are going to the fun part which is what everybody likes to do which is the opportunity section so we'll get to that in a minute so hold hold your ideas not time for having fun right it's not right but it's really thinking about things now you can if if it's easier to think about because we have this pretend kind of thing where you think about in the morning what would be nice to have if if something were to be able to like you said wake you up so waking up is a struggle in the morning right so let's let's just say that yeah  so where some of the challenges this is kind of a challenges section if we want to say it but waking up %HESITATION what to eat what to eat  what to wear how did my hair okay these are there going on  all right we'll put what to wear the I should just leave it to you in a room and see what you guys as you try to rein in a cat yeah it's all good it's all good I I I if if I can if I can do this with Jose I can do this with anybody I feel like I'm out out  well you know exactly what you say Aaron I was just thinking what you were you were saying about like pretty much you want someone to take care of all this for me just manage all those good information on eating healthy and working out and just feed it to me in a way I can use it right now and what kind of food you like this is that okay that or what's my work I routinely yeah well it's it's like almost like the best thing would be a person in charge of this but I can't help for  in prison cheese so your solutions personal assistants  get about the yeah isn't it just call the person Susan you're no rain is in rain is so slow so basically what we're doing here again let's let's talk so we have waking up we have what to eat we have what to wear %HESITATION lady maybe it's gonna tell us the what the weather's like today whether I need to know the weather because I need to know what what I need to wear perhaps a good to %HESITATION you know I need to know what the traffic situation is like okay right  Sir I I think those things are relevant to what I have to do in the morning  Khloe saying good morning you are awesome you know you can't wait for this great day it might rain grab your umbrella  I think this is right yeah she's right  she's writing copy that only you you'll be ready for the next day I trust me you're gonna be so good  you just let me know what you guys can act after the show  and so all right so let's move into the afternoon what are some of the the challenges or the gaps and what you you would like to have that you don't have in the afternoon  so that they were going to lunch right so we've we've gone to lunch %HESITATION you know I think  what what what is that  it reminded us distracts from time to time to get up and get away from the machine  that that's a problem because I'm too laser focus on work and and then my body tightens up  because that would be a threat I could yep that's real good point good point good pay item I know your health not what you contribute to this exercise you got in the when I do this  %HESITATION yet Hey by the way can you hear me better yes I can hear you perfectly alright I check my  from %HESITATION you know I'm I'm just looking to pick up my calories to a finite amount  that's all we control calories or OR and monitor calories are you mention that but keeping that consistent throughout the day that's that's the tough part there  okay  someone somebody saying a sedentary warning like this yeah kind of time like you're just sitting still for too long yeah so that's goes in and that's that's the the most interesting thing about this exercise is when the %HESITATION  why am I spelling this complete around okay %HESITATION when you're doing kind of this with people who we don't want to focus on where things aren't working so we we have solutions for things but how do they mapped to kind of a little bit what what we know the act does or what we know it doesn't do but it could do so this is this is great so %HESITATION let's talk so about knowing when to stretch so the solution we talked about and we'll save those please don't forget those sanitary let that would go on the opportunity section %HESITATION so what's a couple more in the afternoon things that are gaps and again this is the most challenging part because you really have to think about where in your day  are you know kind of lacking in information or %HESITATION again  alerts whatever it is  well I I told me I would love it to be able to log how I feel a little bit because maybe I'm not paying too much attention so sometimes I eat a certain kind of food and I feel really lethargic afterwards so I would like to be able to monitor that a little bit so your moods yeah my mood and energy level I need to measure that  okay so make it easy for me  the mood right  the the app comes with a mood ring yeah feel like for example if I go out and I somehow indulgence of having some fried chicken or something and at the moment so I'll go but later that day I like both  and just feeling really sleepy right now right  yeah and so evening  can our in the evening %HESITATION Erin  what we do now maybe it he started showing me pictures of girls working out or something  this is a different kind of half has changed a lot %HESITATION  I don't notice any motivation I need some they give me the fuel to be like you can do this ma'am you got it to have a drink or something I like a smoothie drink or something  you're asking a lot from your app  that's what you need to use and I'm telling you  enter to have the movie before you go to work out maybe  tell me want to drink it yeah I know right now  %HESITATION  red is a this is quickly becoming a personal says that yeah  these things from because pretty much don't they'll become that no no and and this exercise is a broader one that you would do earlier in the project like I said where you want to learn more about what the users are actually doing and where some of the challenges and where are some ideas and then you begin to map all of that we're doing as you X. designers always mapping tool goal so the goal is whatever the client wants to achieve which is again adding some new seats  we're having some new ideas for features and so you're you're mapping this to to features and then these are a lot of ideas but this is not gonna be the end result %HESITATION okay so it's it's like I need motivation right now because it's in the day I want to take a short cut I don't want to work out right now and I need you to pump me up so the actual solution and I don't know I just need to pumped up for Erin it's like seeing how girls work out %HESITATION somebody else might want to see an inspirational quote or something I just need to find the energy so I can get myself to the gym or like a work out routine like all the rock to this work out today you should do it too something  recommendations on work I recommend workout routine like someone I think about it yep okay like it read what I did yesterday he's I only did back yesterday got to do just  do you do this today yeah and then so here's what we're gonna do we're going to switch over to opportunities that you guys can't say focus that you are working with Canada because it's like no matter how many times you told you just tell me the problem they'll tell me the solution you guys are here's what you can do everything on time  yeah yeah exact running too realistic real bad client no it's okay it's all good %HESITATION no so we'll move into future opportunities and this is where everybody has the most fun honestly it is because this is where like you said so we talked about things in the morning so you said %HESITATION %HESITATION tell me what to eat %HESITATION  to me  tell me how to eat but what's %HESITATION what's something aside from just tell me what to eat what's something that could be a potential solution actually for for that meaning allow  I am I know what and maybe there are some really good recipes so that you can break up the area the hum drum of these these super healthy foods right yeah interesting ways to eat the same thing but just mix it up show me easy recipes yeah morning Casey Casey easy recipes and maybe somewhere in there too is I don't know where it may be in the miscellaneous column is when you're out shopping reminds you things like if you if you had starlink a like that tell you next time at trader Joe's in the pick up these things okay so I'm gonna rein it in a little bit raining that %HESITATION so that would be somewhere one in the evening if you're shopping yeah probably most likely okay so  so what did you say that again sorry %HESITATION yeah it's like a shopping shopping lists mmhm yep grocery shopping list of like that  is it recommending things to you or no is it based on the recipes that you okay I have highlighted like the that was delicious %HESITATION I'm gonna try that so it's going to now create a shopping list based on the recipes are like that's cool okay yeah  so we got that going on  and what are some other things so sorry guys I'm done all this moving around there could be a a laundry pick up drop off service that's attached to this because you know we're working out in Dallas stinky clothes and home that's that's an idea that would be in miscellaneous someone mentioning in the comment that it's like for someone that simplifies more this is getting super confusing right now could you address the one area so but it's not there so if you're literally I'm I'm gonna be super my literal self if you are  let's let's take this through  really quick just hit pause for a second on on the exercise  you have done six weeks of research you did Google laying you went out and to jams and you talk to people %HESITATION you interviewed fourteen twenty eight people at different gyms across southern California and you gathered information about what their days like you gathered information about you know just what some of their pain points are %HESITATION even like what what kind of apps are they using you're asking these questions as you're moving in to the next part your your actually eat now sitting down with the client showing them what their users saying and what the users are liking and not liking about their products and then you're sitting down and you're you're sitting there and mapping these things out this is going to be part of a bigger puzzle it's just a piece of the puzzle and I know that it's kind of like you XP comes weirdly like math and not in that you need to do any calculus sometimes %HESITATION but what you're doing is there's an order of operations and this is somewhere earlier and you know solving a problem and it's not the solution it's just gathering information you're not gonna get to the solution until you unpack all of this so you're gonna take all this information and you're gonna catalog and document it might end up looking something like this in the end because we're not really using real white board your transcribing it from the white board you're putting it into a document like this and what you're starting to do again is is this this mapping of things and you're starting to see patterns of what are some of the main pain points what are some of the tasks that were common from you know ten different stickies from  you know ten fifteen people in the room clients and designers and everybody and then you start to come up with cool ideas and then you start to massage and polished as ideas and those ideas become features and then those features become use cases and they get broken down even in more detail and then you can document them and say this is how this is supposed to work in all these different scenarios so you know how does the welcome page work is it just one thing %HESITATION can you do a few different things but you don't even get to the welcome page yet right now we're just figuring out what are some of the the the tasks that a person does what are some of the gaps that they experience within their day that were as we see it little potential for like mom this could be better and then actually identifying some opportunities but these are not solutions these are just gathering information I want to put a disclaimer on that this is not going to get you to %HESITATION the the the solution at this point it won't come until a little bit later once you've had some time to unpack this information culture  %HESITATION okay so where are we here somewhere in opportunity somewhere in the fun part here so when it comes to solutions I was a couple things you guys said earlier so you talked about waking me up I think %HESITATION so what could be something as far as waking you up as it is an alarm is it music is it what what is it that's waking I think it's a combination of music in in the tree okay maybe can be a daily mix where you hearing like I the tiger or something like that and then you're just seeing like people like this is a montage of people looking really healthy living a great life and and it just had a couple of quotes here and there okay  so it would not only with that motivate you to get up there and  and I was thinking like he's like no no no that's not as intense like that's a strong Waco buzzing in like a nice flu or something  have you had a flute looking you can wear and  yes %HESITATION like that I guess we have different ideas of how to wake up and get motivated  when I get up you know  and %HESITATION my version will my virgin sound like give me up in the morning  the night of the tiger Ono okay all right coming back to this so when it comes to the morning %HESITATION we're talking about health and fitness right so yeah yeah these are things that would be nice wake me up that's that's related to my house I'm not you know frazzled when I get up in the morning showing me tasty recipes outs a great one what's something else in the morning we talked about that could be useful so %HESITATION we said a few things earlier so just coming back to that %HESITATION what something else they all you guys at all these wonderful ideas now is your time to shine now shut up you'll see well it's it's the challenging part because you you're at you have to dig in a little bit deeper than just the ideas that's where the gap park comes and you have to really think about like you know it also gets you to the point to to go back to that that person's question %HESITATION sometimes you realize the solution youth you think is the right solution in your current iteration of something isn't and you realize all the people aren't even doing that that's not even a thing people don't take the phones in the bathroom for example that's just not a thing and you realize we have to rethink this because it's it's not really working with what they need or we have too many features right you get to a point where there's like you have ten features and then we go back to hold  these kind of feature matrix where we're doing short term medium term and long term things and really scoring those and that would be like another step after after that so so what what section are we in right now we're in the opportunities the future opportunities are we still in the morning or in the afternoon now we can move to the afternoon if not I will move into you say let's ask the community here on Facebook on you too what kind of opportunities are there are based on the the the previous two steps we've done  so we can come back to that if we want to have a quick look here previous two steps yeah those great when you review and then we'll we'll give our audience an opportunity to then gather their thoughts yeah I won't read through every last one but just right some interesting ones here in the morning %HESITATION packing your Gen Bragg %HESITATION Jason meal prep possibly and getting ready for work afternoon you're managing your energy which is an interesting one we talked about %HESITATION match member the mood kind of thing you mentioned as well %HESITATION getting coffee you're sitting at your computer %HESITATION here trying to get home you're planning your work out of your having a quick snack %HESITATION maybe you're meditating at some point before you work out as well and so some of the gaps we looked at was you know challenges are waking up in the morning what do I eat knowing what the weather is knowing when traffic is this visit to my day which is why I can see why some people are asking does this turn into a personal assistant %HESITATION but does this play into you know your mental health as well as your physical health because I feel like when your mental health is is solid you feel more motivated to do things and so I think these two things interrelate maybe not as like boom boom one to one but maybe in a in a roundabout way %HESITATION no  knowing when to stretch my moods my energy level %HESITATION not you know being necessarily monitoring my calories %HESITATION  as I eat throughout the day %HESITATION we can going back to motivation and not feeling inspired to work out and going back to knowing when to stretch which I just realize we have twice suggestion yeah what about a good meeting in the morning just to make you feel good that first to good morning yeah %HESITATION and it's  %HESITATION the like maybe the whether it's seventy two degrees so sunny and you know get ready to start the day you know just something happy yeah okay  happy morning greeting  current  it's interesting to hear everybody's versions Chris once fire and fire and guitar solos  and the US something wasn't it yeah yeah baby stuff so custom custom morning greeting I like that that's actually more maps to maybe  yeah yeah yeah in the afternoon %HESITATION kind of a what we call this like a mood %HESITATION Chris how did you describe it  and Tyrese to measure your energy level  mood diary right like maybe there's like a five  five options like how you feel today after what you ate what you ate and it remembers what you ate so okay pumped I'm not feeling so great so that's %HESITATION that's kind of a %HESITATION a questionnaire almost like a check in like a mood check in as well so they %HESITATION diary but maybe a mood check in something like that  how are you doing this I want to prepare Adam for the way we're in and the show he's going to write a custom song for us that's gonna help us wake up in the morning and he's  our next week yeah you got that so many sometimes amuse yourself work out you too man yeah  who's who's is user who is the appealing to who he adds up to him okay the flint he can say good morning it's seventy two and sunny today because  in California I can be like let's get up yellow is due is it's up to him  now I you know that the term calorie checker makes me think of like you know %HESITATION old school weight watchers or something like that I don't really like that term so so if it's something that's that's kind of %HESITATION maybe maybe this this app could come with you know a Fitbit or something like that it's not maybe it's not the Fitbit at maybe it comes with the watch or something that that lives on you that's kind of tracking maybe your movement maybe it's a movement tracker we talked about knowing when to stretch so let's add that when there but also when it comes to %HESITATION  calorie intake so how to how would we want to would you want to know that would be something you'd want to know sars a potential opportunity as if an app could do something which you want to do that  and I'm hearing the main thing from this up that I'd like you to do is manage my mood somehow and then give me a like a work out routine that's like a month longer something keep me on them okay if I had those two things I think that we go okay  %HESITATION Chloe has a good suggestion here she's I get it maybe there is an onboarding wizard that allows you to customize our options like how how how intense the energy levels are you you  drill sergeants are you one of a kind grant %HESITATION yogam on something like yeah yeah  so there's there's a if that's a feature right yeah that could be a future yeah yeah and some of the glowing they have not gets the features %HESITATION love a level of intensity %HESITATION  of work outs I guess is what we're talking about yeah or %HESITATION or of coaching I guess within as hot coaching and maybe there's some kind of built in pedometer or some activity monitor so it's going to remind you you Hey you know get off your **** we've been sitting around for too long write something like that yeah gives you enough and they can give you a couple of badges the rewards for hitting certain milestones we can give the finest little ma'am %HESITATION since we want to work with other workout burrows in Erin's par lance maybe there's a little fun competition where you're gonna see yourselves on some kind of graph in terms of what you're doing in terms of the end input what you're putting into your body and I'll put how many how many calories or how many miles are moving yeah so this game if I make the social make it fun yeah  and so let's talk about the evening a little bit so we talked about shopping list for my recipes %HESITATION we have some interesting things here related to the afternoon in the morning and we have some miscellaneous actually quite a few now talk about the evening some opportunities in the evening what is it that we want to know when it relates to health and fitness in the evening after my work out before my work out  hmmm  the work out routine that I'm looking down the barrel of a Brandon had a good suggestion Harry says maybe at the  syncs up with your watch in it measures how  how efficient you were while listening to a particular piece of music so it's going to map your work out in your space relative to the piece of music or listing to the sentencing %HESITATION  how we want to wear them but I want to call them as any it throws together playlists free or something mood playlist that goes back to moods again that's probably music calorie monitor something  something like that yeah yeah calorie play that's that's but it turned out I like it recording things for  okay that's like let me some badges  no no man bellwether brand is saying I totally want is out right now  that's how it should work now and so %HESITATION  what else do we have think where where a here getting into the home stretch yes let's get into the home stretch because we're all we're stretched out in terms of our ability to focus  reading them but I definitely see the value of doing this because I feel like there's so many ideas firing off in my brain right now like maybe it just plays music for me all day different songs on here I mean I just feel like I don't know about I have all these ideas right now yeah any  we were in person we would and and and a white bread you would just be to do writing up ideas this is the portion where everybody you know kind of there chomping at the bit right to to get to this portion but the other two questions have to happen because we're really mapping it to something specific of like we %HESITATION we talked about I go to the grocery store or I I'm planning my meals are I'm doing whatever so that's that's  really what you're doing in this exercise and again it's it's like a zoom in and nugget of a bigger picture so someone is as great idea maybe it like puts together report that I can give my doctor you know I like check ups %HESITATION check this out then okay let's do that let's let's well one more and then we I think we need to kind of wrap the show care in the home stretch a little I'm a little hungry and talk about this food working out  I'm motivated so Adam are you almost ready to do your thing because I'm a do the recap  I like some recap music Adam and then Blass's out to %HESITATION and outro okay so what's the last one they gonna put up there  okay so what would you put up with a lot I can't really read it you have to read it to me %HESITATION I would put up the last one I called it %HESITATION report out to my doctor okay yeah all right so let's summarize this whole thing you guys are summarized in the cold you want to summarize what the intent of what it is that you're doing right now and then I will do my show recap yep okay basically the intent and thank you guys all for your for your thoughts and and different ideas going on so it was kind of fun to do this live %HESITATION that the basic intent is to get to a point where you can take all this information start to see patterns and things related to mood so even without doing this affinity mapping affinity mapping is literally just taking postage and putting things close together that sound similar or whatever %HESITATION mood was a big thing and mental health was actually more %HESITATION conversation as to why you wouldn't work out as opposed to the actual act of working out once you get into working out urine flow it's fine to getting into the motivation %HESITATION the the mood and the whole deal that that that was kind of a theme that if I was  it's kind of mapping this I would be like you know me you think about focusing a little bit more in the mood and then the other little extra work out related things %HESITATION they're just a bonus and they're you know expected but they're not they're not the main point in what makes the app valuable for example  okay perfect  Nicole before I do the mental modeling recap here how do people get in touch with you I know there's some job opportunities of people want to get work so this is one of those rare channels actually we're going to teach you wear that hopefully entertain you but there might be obscene everything's made  no Nero how do people get a job and I can mobile phone I mean you can email us where you know you can email info at I come up with a com or you can email me and Nicole dot Johnson and I'm a chemical dot com and what what we're looking for is probably towards the the end of the year is  is potentially some you acts and you I interns and some senior designers and if you have focus and %HESITATION you know  designing for like product design or issues in in automotive it's actually quite challenging and Los Angeles to find automotive because it's I was the more the Detroit's or you have a say in Europe and and other places like that so automotive experience design for automotive is types of things were looking for and again Nicole dot Johnson and I come up com perfect thank you very much so let me do the recap Adam are you in the house or you have to go pick up your kid I'm I'm I hear all right so can you give me some music like recap music something that's kind of not going to be with my voice  all of which got  all right so let's do it  the U. S. mental modeling recap here's what we learned the double diamond is about research discovery definitions design and delivery I wish the first research with the D. word because it seems a lot of plays  but mental modeling slips right in between those two between research and discovery and as we dove deeper there's certain things that we're trying to mentor modeling we're getting information  and I think there are six components to it affordances basically what are the users expectations simplicity how easy is it to use the military Iritty do we recognize it availability is the mental load the complexity of it what are we asking of the user in terms of how complex it is flexibility to have more than one way to do something and then feedback there's action and reaction so that we know we're doing something mental modeling's goal is to define features and use cases and the core components are three things task and basically we're looking at this from that day in the life of the user gaps where we're going to end his B. needs and challenges I think and and opportunities the future potential solutions and one of things that Nicole was doing was something called affinity mapping as on super complicated basically just trying to group similar things pass Lucien's and we're looking for patterns  the tools because you guys love tools and resources for you ex designer  aside from our wonderful researchers at the future dot com is to use excel  action %HESITATION notion keynote on the gravel sketch in general as an assembly all right guys nickel I wanna thank you for coming on the show thank you for have a story  Aaron and Erica for bring it Adam  we're about to wrap up the show right so you ready gonna think about I think you were much like does this give Nicole a big round of applause  the main purpose of children okay here we go good things are tuning in we're out here Adam motivate me I want to go eat work out let's do this switch the gear do  all right so %HESITATION  being wooed  Adam yeah  in  I'm not  the
