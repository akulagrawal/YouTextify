I was losing my name's Bobby commercial and shared around we're gonna sit now with twenty five masters of the design industry we're gonna learn from them every single week we're gonna learn how the best companies in the world approach communicate and a poor design in their businesses everyday in this episode we're seeing now with video hill works DA is the director of design and were you focus on having a transparency defining design principles to that team and using narratives to get buy in from stakeholders will get to this episode right after this quick message from our partners to stick around  for decades design has impacted how we live  now it's beginning to shape how we work here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  thanks for joining us thank you for having me go right so first question %HESITATION what's one thing about design that's clear to you that you don't think it's quite others  so I spend quite a bit of time thinking about this and %HESITATION to me design is about team work and I don't always think that that's obvious to everyone %HESITATION as a designer you start out your career usually honing your craft %HESITATION but I think you know no design can be done alone you're always in a team and if I look back at my own career %HESITATION the  %HESITATION is %HESITATION no product no design I could have produced or %HESITATION shipped without help of others beat designers others around you so  it's something that I want to instill in other designers and when I look at portfolios or interview someone is trying to get to %HESITATION the core of that like how do they work with others %HESITATION %HESITATION how did they get to %HESITATION results because I don't think any great %HESITATION product %HESITATION exists in isolation  do you do you believe the designers can actually own an idea or do you think that it belongs to more than one person  so it's a good question I think to some degree ID's are cheap by Iran invent that quote %HESITATION yeah %HESITATION in my in my days I DO %HESITATION that was it was something that was repeated over and over again so you get a lot of ideas out %HESITATION I think there is a part ownership %HESITATION but %HESITATION I think it's more about taking something good %HESITATION and making it better so continuously building iterating and that's where you get over time a sense of ownership that you can she be it contributed to a great design %HESITATION and sometimes %HESITATION %HESITATION does contributions are obvious and and and and you feel good about them sometimes they're the smallest detail but %HESITATION to me that's the definition of ownership in in design  well %HESITATION you are probably the only designer I know who has a graduate degree in economics  %HESITATION  it is %HESITATION probably true %HESITATION AT your banker is that we're saying here actually I was used to reshuffle portfolios back in nineteen ninety nine it's awesome it's no joke %HESITATION that lasted for about three months however %HESITATION %HESITATION yeah I know it's it's it's a path that chosen when I was seventeen %HESITATION eighteen %HESITATION since I filled %HESITATION a pilot school %HESITATION I'm actually happy I didn't become a pilot to be a terrible pilot %HESITATION but yeah that's correct %HESITATION are there any like core principles that you learned in that period of time that has somehow help shape the way you approach designed for specifically how design actually plays a role in the business  I think that  any background where that's economics or other %HESITATION and even beyond education shapes who you are as a designer %HESITATION I think there are certainly things that %HESITATION influenced me as a designer with my background %HESITATION  let's be interesting to think of it in terms of more macroeconomic %HESITATION %HESITATION theories %HESITATION like demand and supply %HESITATION %HESITATION I think what's interesting about that is %HESITATION you know if you put good design forward %HESITATION people are going to want that and I think over the last decade you've seen that where that's apple in the hardware space or %HESITATION even with software to quality of the experiences we we enjoy today %HESITATION to me there there is there is some connection to that and obviously %HESITATION %HESITATION you know back I think in my days %HESITATION  in college someone said if it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense so %HESITATION just there's a business reality all of those things yeah %HESITATION %HESITATION I I don't know who the court is it true we did too but %HESITATION it always stuck with me %HESITATION and then more recently I've come to think of price  %HESITATION itself number as %HESITATION actually a product experience its price makes you feel a certain way low price match may make you feel good because you're getting a bargain may make you feel bad because you tried to sell your house %HESITATION and obviously being it over %HESITATION price and how we deal with price in the experience of pricing %HESITATION %HESITATION I've come to think of that as user experience not just a number it's actually much deeper than that and how you communicate and designed around that is over %HESITATION  we as an industry talk about minimum viable product a lot is there such a thing as an economically viable design  I believe a design should never hurts %HESITATION a revenue stream for example right because that's just bad design %HESITATION so I think they're linked they're they're they're linked in the sense that %HESITATION if you can't complete a certain task yeah that's going to hurt the business %HESITATION and I think is that realization that makes designed so important %HESITATION %HESITATION and and to me that's the the things I look for is this design supporting %HESITATION the best case for the business %HESITATION and at a bare minimum is it not you know introducing %HESITATION %HESITATION friction or %HESITATION something that you can complete those  at the end of the day people are buying something %HESITATION they're not just spending money %HESITATION randomly %HESITATION so you have to be able to deliver that and the best way possible and that's where design comes in  so we we talk a lot about effective communication and design  so my first question is do you think our industry does a good job communicating what we do to to people that aren't designers %HESITATION and the second part to that question is how do you communicate are designed to non designers of the other people around you  transfers part I think it varies %HESITATION I think we've seen great improvements in how we communicate the value of the design %HESITATION in the last decade or so %HESITATION I think there'd be many %HESITATION %HESITATION companies and people who have done a great job ads %HESITATION not only telling the stories but actually delivering great experiences %HESITATION and you know you can go for the usual suspects %HESITATION apple but also %HESITATION companies like Facebook and and and Google has really stepped up their their design game as well %HESITATION so I think we're getting better and better ads %HESITATION establishing design as a as a as a requirement %HESITATION and communication is a big part of that %HESITATION and you know one of the things I I I learned back in college in economics or at a bank or things like that is %HESITATION selling and their design always has a part selling because what we create isn't real until it is real so therefore you need to convince others that this  is the best that this is the way forward internal selling say so it's it's with the stake holders and getting them to essentially believe in the thing that I think it starts there because %HESITATION  you have to make it real it has to become a reality and once it becomes a reality you can talk about it you can communicate it outwardly yeah but it starts internally %HESITATION because otherwise it has no no %HESITATION booting in in in reality in something that you can achieve or talk about %HESITATION so what so what do you focus on your your selling design internally or talking to people that might not understand what it is designers to write what is like what are you are you walking in with something they can look at in touch for you walking in and kind of vocalizing an idea getting them in from a white board to draw some stuff like how do you how do you engage them what is the selling process look like %HESITATION I think I'd be lucky to work out a lot of companies that %HESITATION  got the value of design so I don't I need to do less selling of the function person per se however %HESITATION you always need to communicate  can't keep it in this like magic box and and keep it there and when they say this is it we're going forward so %HESITATION I think there's communicating %HESITATION excitement about something and that might be higher fidelity but there's also communicating how things work %HESITATION what it takes to get there %HESITATION and does a whole different thing so it's it's a communications we spectrum %HESITATION I mean as designers we once the you know the maze  ng animations the amazing graphics something that looks %HESITATION %HESITATION you know appealing %HESITATION and that's good that helps but not when you're talking to %HESITATION front end engineers are back and engineers you once %HESITATION to make sure that you communicate well where is this call coming from at which point is this transition %HESITATION seer tailoring it to the audience absolutely you're still had different thing every time absolutely %HESITATION you have to be able to to walk those %HESITATION %HESITATION lines between because if you you know if you put a an amazingly detailed design %HESITATION you gonna get amazingly detailed feedback and that's not always what you want so tailing the %HESITATION the message to the audience is something that I mean most folks would agree is is a good thing and we have to do it because if we if you do it at the end and I've made mistakes myself %HESITATION and and afterwards you tell yourself yeah well that's what I would be done to learn from the process yeah so they're they're probably I mean thousands of people watching this right now that %HESITATION  a probably don't understand that selling is a is a  a component of the function of design and these are designers right %HESITATION we really want them to try to think about walking into their next meeting and not just presenting where you're presenting like an excel spreadsheet right now you want to really pitch you want to get people excited about this thing what are some steps they can take %HESITATION to a think about the audience to make sure that their tailoring the message %HESITATION what is the medium of presentation that they should be thinking about %HESITATION and then are there things that they should be saying she  they be focusing on the process should they be talking kinda long term %HESITATION here's what we're gonna do in the next six months or Hey here's how we start next week and you're going to be a part of it like one of the things that they should be thinking about their  one of the things that I've come to realize is that as designers essentially we're storytellers you whenever you enter meeting you're telling a story sometimes we short story sometimes a longer story %HESITATION but the story builds up has different %HESITATION ways of %HESITATION going %HESITATION fruits narrative and I think that's where the key is you start out with thinking about it as a story so as an introduction as a plot and now I'm getting a little you know the detail about it don't go write a novel or something but %HESITATION  I think you have to take people along the journey %HESITATION and %HESITATION and even though that sounds kind of you know silly %HESITATION %HESITATION it's rooted in reality %HESITATION because most folks that look at a design a fresh to it they don't they don't sometimes they don't even have contacts so and it even if it's a small thing %HESITATION so I think the minute you think of it as a story you start to be more mindful about how you're going to tell that story because you can just go in because it's all the all the alternative is from up a few screens and you're rambling on one screen for ten minutes and it's only like a weight I need to move on to the next thing and then you know we've all we've probably all being in those design reviews that that turned into a bit of a a chaos and %HESITATION and then everyone's chiming in and %HESITATION you covered two percent of what you actually want to cover %HESITATION  so I think that's important now  I think everyone does it a little differently and I I don't have a set process how you communicate so some L. %HESITATION there's different %HESITATION times use different techniques but %HESITATION clarity is important and hitting some some some points that you you want to hit and %HESITATION also leaving a design review with %HESITATION %HESITATION some amount of of you know assurance like okay this is what we're gonna do next or this is how we %HESITATION gonna it's going to involve this war worst case scenario %HESITATION the story was terrible and %HESITATION you start over and that happens to and that's okay %HESITATION so I think it starts with that and I myself I'm still trying to become a better storyteller it's hard as are the yeah like are you doing anything to become a better story told teller what are you focusing on for yourself I read a lot of fiction nice that I mean it  it's amazing the the world she can create out of letters and words that arrange themselves %HESITATION and %HESITATION I remember during my time at Flipboard we had %HESITATION %HESITATION really yeah professional folks dad had decades of experience in the magazine industry  and how they think about creating an article for instance and %HESITATION the story arcs in lines and that's what opened my eyes to being able %HESITATION to tell good stories %HESITATION but yeah that's something that I'm still working on his writing scares the Bee Gees are  for decades design has impacted how we  live  now it's beginning to shape how we work  here at IBM design thinking has given us a new framework for teaming for co creating with our clients and users it's helping us make decisions faster  and it's keeping humans at the center of everything we do  we're inspired by our design program which is over sixty years old  today IBM employs more than one thousand three hundred professional designers and we've certified more than sixty thousand IBM verse in the practices of IBM design thinking  the result  divers teams working more closely than ever with our clients their users and our partners to create modern solutions  %HESITATION provide differentiated human centered outcomes to the world we'd love to share the story more closely with you  and I hope to see you soon at one of our IBM studios worldwide  we'd also like to thank our friends and envision for their support invision is the world's leading product design platform powering the future of digital design through their deep understanding of the importance of collaboration there used by some of the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One every Indy and that looks let me tell you three reasons why I use it one poor communication is one of the biggest blockers for talented team to we don't get feedback from others early and often you can get lost in the woods and that's just bad for everyone and three without a prototype it can be hard to show others your full vision for design invision solve all of that you can rapidly prototype at the front end of the design process  and collaborate across every stage of the project it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design work flow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from project managers to designers and developers and writers teams that build digital products are a serious advantage when they use envision sweet a prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit invision apt Akan and use our access code I. N. B. E. dash high resolution for three months free  so you've now been over for over a year and since then there's a lot of great projects of ships but what we're really cares about is what your first three months look like %HESITATION and especially what your prioritized coming into a pre existing design team  %HESITATION so  you know taking over %HESITATION a design team is never an easy things of the first things you do is not necessarily diving into the pixels %HESITATION I took the time to %HESITATION assess both the team composition %HESITATION also %HESITATION reached out to %HESITATION product managers and engineering to see %HESITATION even though the project has just started what are some of the things that were working weren't working %HESITATION so they have a three sixty view of it once that was done you really want to dive in and %HESITATION the main challenge at over verses a re small start up is that %HESITATION you're really proposing changes that affect hundreds if not close to a thousand people that work on this product %HESITATION so  that told  see that as a design team and design organization we need to have our act together because if we don't that chaos breeds more chaos and %HESITATION that's the last thing you want  %HESITATION the other thing was to really focus the design team %HESITATION and find and if the high impact projects like this you want a team that really works well together where %HESITATION there's no concerns about egos or who owns what %HESITATION and that takes time %HESITATION coming in as someone new leading the team %HESITATION you need to build trust %HESITATION %HESITATION with with the entire team %HESITATION so was re too full to free the the first three months was a setting up a process for the design team %HESITATION to be successful and to let them %HESITATION run in an organized manner to was also %HESITATION making sure all the stakeholders %HESITATION and that is mostly product and engineering %HESITATION understood what we were trying to do  yeah weekly updates all those things you need to set up a minimum amount of process not too much because then it feels bureaucratic which is also not great but you need to create space for designers to do what they do best which is create amazing work %HESITATION and %HESITATION so that was really the food first three months is is getting it's like yeah  starting the engine making sure keeps running sometimes stalls to okay should we started but keep keep the engine running %HESITATION and make sure your you know  people mentioned it before but at some point you just become the **** umbrella for everyone %HESITATION there's no no %HESITATION more PC way of saying it that is really a big part of my job is to ensure that the team can do what they want and get them excited about the problem head %HESITATION cell and then additionally to that is is also talked about product talked about engineering but also %HESITATION her we loop in research contents make them part of the process to really figure out where where we're going %HESITATION and a lot of uncertainty you need to be comfortable with uncertainty those first months are going to be now uncertain you're not going to know where it goes yes you have an inkling you take a few bets but %HESITATION it's it's messy design is messy people forget that it's never cleaned that result should be clean yeah but how you get there is I think every designer you'll talk to is going to have a different experience of how they got to where they got %HESITATION in in a product you talk a weekly updates much a very curious just tactically like what what is a weekly update update look like %HESITATION who does it go out to is a design focused and then what do you focus on %HESITATION in that update  so doesn't go out it's in person I don't like sending docks and things like that they're great for documentation at some point every week %HESITATION we would sit together either over over a video conference call whatever you know with the lead so engineering product design gotcha whatever needs to be there minimum amount of people preferably %HESITATION so it was a group of five people maybe and %HESITATION  we talked for it and the first three months is really designed talking because the engineer looking at you like what you got Yasser what you got what are we doing now %HESITATION  and that was great that cadence was great but %HESITATION %HESITATION but I I I don't like sitting out like emails I mean they're important they can be important for our organization but %HESITATION %HESITATION for design like you need to do that in person you need to %HESITATION you know unit also need to build trust %HESITATION %HESITATION documents and and sly stone is a bill that same amount of trust I believe so  Travis is currently the CEO who were obviously and her yeah %HESITATION yes  talk to us a little bit about your relationship with him and his team %HESITATION and how are they  empowering designed specifically digital product design at over  %HESITATION  Travis was great to work with %HESITATION she really %HESITATION gave enough room for the product design team to %HESITATION explore to come up with a design %HESITATION that speaks to what uber is about %HESITATION and %HESITATION and the mission we have %HESITATION and how it fits within the broader %HESITATION %HESITATION you know well that who wants to create an  he he's really excited about those things which is refreshing to see %HESITATION he's not prescriptive but he will push %HESITATION so for instance %HESITATION  you know he he wants the map to come alive inside were product that's cool %HESITATION of course we're like %HESITATION does that mean we're gonna build sim city right %HESITATION preferably yes but that's not going to happen but it it tells us that we can push the envelope from a creative perspective from a design perspective to start bringing some things alive that once you open the uber app and you're trying to get a ride that you feel like you're in your city or see that you're visiting and that it feels alive  N. and that sets the tone for everything allows you to do %HESITATION things and %HESITATION so again not prescriptive necessarily it's not specific solution it's it's %HESITATION it's these nuggets that really get people excited that I think  a CEO can do those things that's amazing right you can walk you can say I want the map to be a life and just walk out  and I think designers get excited about that %HESITATION yeah %HESITATION and so when I was three years ago really good about that and %HESITATION and he's also supportive of those things and will make it happen you know call themselves the chief problem solver which I think is kind of cool it's like you know %HESITATION so you see something says something and let's people own the solution to it and %HESITATION as designers we don't have a responsibility to hit that to do that and that's exciting that's exactly so speaking about the trust an apartment that Travis established in the design team %HESITATION after your first three months or during that period of time your first  project was the recent uber app redesign that's right %HESITATION okay so I mean the first thought that was  a fully executed yes %HESITATION thank you especially considering the scale of of over and I think something that's really %HESITATION interesting to many designers is how does a company at the scale and size of uber actually ship a product with that level of craftsmanship especially the first release  %HESITATION so to be fair I guess it wasn't necessary first release since we've done a couple of releases but the first release in a while of of what we call the rider experience %HESITATION  but I think it goes back to what I said earlier you set the stage in those first three months %HESITATION you know you have executive support %HESITATION to to do this %HESITATION so then it's really up to the design team and design leadership in general %HESITATION to create an environment where you can get to that level of craftsmanship  %HESITATION but more importantly  no it's not the designs that ultimately write the code yeah I mean some try I try it's terrible but and that's good and we we should all prototype and we did a lot of that we had a design engineer on the team who was able to quickly test imported type things in real time we're real code %HESITATION using were a P. eyes so that we could go out and see how it would  yep resonate with users or how is certain animation would feel %HESITATION but it also means working closely with the engineering team %HESITATION because they are the ones who build it and they  get as excited as designers get about these types of things actually I would argue that some engineers are great designers %HESITATION and I've I've been lucky to work with %HESITATION quite a few frat my career and hear it over to there are quite a few that are amazing ads understanding it and we'll take it to the next level like you know and that they'll they'll do the work for a few hours and then they're like Hey check this out and a look at it like man you made it like ten times better this amazing %HESITATION and it's that's thrust where you're just working together back in for if that is %HESITATION that is critical %HESITATION and it's not always easy because I think many designs were what %HESITATION would not disagree that sometimes things get left on the table that animation you really want it out didn't have time for it I'm sorry %HESITATION but I think it comes back to building excitement and trusts because even during %HESITATION the redesign effort and the final stages I recall that we were reviewing a final animation little dot that comes in and then grows and shows a short cut on the screen  and %HESITATION I really want that in there for a gazillion reasons but what was amazing is that %HESITATION it got hot fixed into the apt two days before it shipped and I did not have to argue for it a platform engineer  did the job for me and that was an amazing moment because you certainly have %HESITATION an entire team and organise  nation that supports these types of decisions %HESITATION and I think as designers like building those bridges is important %HESITATION because the next time something doesn't make it into the product so you should ask yourself well why was that here was there you know did I not full of %HESITATION entirely was a truly a trade off isn't going to get into the next release like what how how how do we do those things because sometimes you know after the first disappointment we sort of give up like okay never made it yet %HESITATION I would like to ask the question okay when's the next release once the next release how long is it going to take what does it take %HESITATION and keep pushing that %HESITATION and I encourage also it over sit down with your engineers because they'll love it trust the love it so it sounded like there was a great deal of buy in from engineering which is really important and you spoke about the bridges that designer scenes of former these different on these different works to be able to ship this level product but what did that actually look like was designed sitting next engineering while they work on this project like yeah how did they establish that that report was sitting very close  %HESITATION yeah you have to %HESITATION proximity is everything sometimes you need to go away and focus not alone but as designers as a team there is times when you need to not be distracted %HESITATION minute mainly because you're just trying to figure out your story you don't have a story yet you don't have anything to show yet and it's terrible so there's times when you need to focus %HESITATION and there's times when you need to be available where %HESITATION you sit down with engineers and obviously that's hard to scale  the ratio from designs to engineers is  might be one to five might be one to ten who knows so the other thing we did is we start building an internal website where we just started sharing all of the design hold the motion prototypes and that's slowly started turning into a bit of a platform ask %HESITATION resource for folks but you need to support everything you're trying to achieve because it's not enough to just say well I have this great motion study here and this is how I know people need to know engineers need to know they'll ask you %HESITATION what's the what's the timing on this what's my busy curve if you want to get really technical right like %HESITATION %HESITATION because that point one second might make the difference between having a feel supernatural and something that is terrible %HESITATION so you know we need to as designs need to think beyond just %HESITATION %HESITATION delivering the design itself especially when it matters at scale because there's no way going to sit down with a thousand engineers %HESITATION everyday I wanna I wanna get into I would go back to the hot fix %HESITATION because like that to me is a rare thing it's not that engineers don't care that designers don't know necessarily how to work with engineers to make them care I just think it's it's rare to find a level of collaboration around Polish %HESITATION where to me that that probably speaks a little bit more to the values of of uber and its products instabilities right so the engineer probably found it inconceivable to launch something that everyone didn't whole heartedly believe in %HESITATION  what do you think  drove that hot fix at the end of the day %HESITATION yeah  I think it goes back to what we're talking about earlier %HESITATION a bit of communication and also %HESITATION education in the sense that I think %HESITATION you know we sometimes only see what we want to see and I feel the role of design is also to open people's eyes to how mazing it can be and I think throughout the process because it happened so early in the process now %HESITATION I think we were able to build that excitement created excitement where it became natural to have that and it was foreign to not happy so you switch it around whereas usually there's a you live in a world where now we don't need that  used people start to think like something missing something not quite right here %HESITATION and that's where you want to get to it but it takes time it takes %HESITATION it it certainly takes time I mean I remember like when the engineer started %HESITATION day they need to get their machine running to now like four weeks the apt look like nothing frankly quarters they they rewrote the entire app from scratch %HESITATION so literally the you know their first prototype was a box sure it's like okay  yeah but you know it and I think they they went through that those phases to but it's really you know where we usually tend to think about something that doesn't need to be there at this house more felt like something was missing and %HESITATION and I feel that that's where %HESITATION %HESITATION design  did a good job it can that since its out I mean it sounds like the whole weekly update thing that you're talking about getting the engineering and the product leads in a room %HESITATION created this the the schedules of reinforcement to show them a what good design looks like %HESITATION and be while you guys were building out or they were the engineers rewriting the out from scratch as they were kind of just putting layers of skin yeah on the app %HESITATION it sounds like that engineers specifically probably saw what the design team had envisioned and saw the delta between that and what was going to ship and there was a moment of pride that came to play that said engineers and engineering is not going to be the blocker of making this call right and and so like big that taking that personal responsibility it sounds like I think that also goes back to what we're talking about earlier that sense of ownership plus were instantly becomes a much broader thing than just a designer fighting for what's right it's like now actually everyone is fighting for what's right that's awesome dream that is the dream doesn't always successfully work that way but as long as you can you know hit those points %HESITATION %HESITATION it I think it matters and %HESITATION doing the right thing it does matter  I have a question rentals  to find you guys built an internal website to share stuff why is that white why internal one not just like a  like an invasion or something maybe we like to build things are self %HESITATION say that I think anyone would recognize that it is like of maker culture there there are yes there are like ten tools no we'll just make out %HESITATION it started I frankly it started  Google slides no nothing got to two hundred slide no kidding and I remember telling the product lead I'm like you know it's gonna break right like and think this is not scalable at all %HESITATION %HESITATION but it worked for awhile and it was great like if you're trying to establish like big pieces and and %HESITATION and you're trying to communicate and and to be honest it was lies is great common features or yelp you name it where you use that or or %HESITATION Dropbox paper it doesn't matter right is there some some great features there but at some point it was really just it was a way for us to communicate at scale right %HESITATION and %HESITATION  and I think it pay dividends because when you re do something as fundamental as %HESITATION our our writer experience  you don't just do it like once and you're done you need to be able let's say someone walks in the door tomorrow at over and says okay how do I design for the rider experience  we need to start somewhere you need to understand the decisions we made the components you can use so that website starts to form a kernel of of more of a platform type or design system %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION website and %HESITATION and websites just one way of communicating that there's many ways but you know it seems like that's the is most easily accessible and %HESITATION and most easy to distribute so it's it really started out as we need to communicate with more engineers and we can sit down with in person %HESITATION and that actually turn into %HESITATION  more of a way to %HESITATION %HESITATION exposed to system that %HESITATION we were working on %HESITATION because it's an and we did both at the same time which somehow I always end up in that situation %HESITATION but it helped because everything you do for a platform perspective is ill influenced by real by real product %HESITATION because the dangers always that you create a platform that looks perfect me like can't use any of this in the real world so %HESITATION %HESITATION and and I I always you know %HESITATION struggle with that balance but I think %HESITATION it is doable but so many things throughout the process %HESITATION %HESITATION sometimes happen by happy accidents %HESITATION and %HESITATION you take that you like actually that's reasonable way of of of being able to do things so what are other tools are resources that have been put in place to help build that excitement transparency outside of design  %HESITATION I think prototyping is key I mean more and more we you see that throughout the industry right and %HESITATION I would even say that %HESITATION there is prototyping on on a level that makes a quick you know you name it you can use %HESITATION invision principal one and framework %HESITATION but also having folks that know how to balance %HESITATION design engineering talked about earlier those people that can actually get production code into the application as well but our designers that Hart %HESITATION I think that's in a role that's involving %HESITATION but %HESITATION we  he wouldn't be able to make ask  progress as quickly as we were if it weren't for %HESITATION a resource like that it's just impossible %HESITATION because that you know as much as framer allows you or any of the other tools allows you to express it in code %HESITATION it's not like you get this ship Java script inside and native application at least not here so %HESITATION being able to even get closer to the metal so to speak %HESITATION is good but that that takes expertise I would recommend you know unless you're really into it a desire to dive into swift and be the best with engineer ever %HESITATION %HESITATION but it becomes important to to do that because %HESITATION nothing is static anymore these days certainly not an application it's impossible to to think of it that way %HESITATION having changes actual question kind of a personal question for you %HESITATION  it looks like numbers were talking earlier before we started recording this it sounded like a lot of your experience just generally as a designer in life has been through a series of apprenticeship it's right %HESITATION what and and that  I mean I would assume you'd probably gave you a lot of mentors in your and your design career what are the things that you were taught %HESITATION when you were a younger designer just breaking into the industry %HESITATION what are some of the things that you were taught that you would impart to other people that are just writing into the industry  %HESITATION so what was interesting so I started out working for audio  and I remember  when I started I always wanted to be right  because I was so afraid  failure or for not being right %HESITATION so that's how  I behaved initially it's like they know is right I know it's right %HESITATION and it was terrible attitude actually I got called out immediately first three months like %HESITATION yeah well you do good work but here %HESITATION you know you should you should open up you should take feedback each day critique of terrible taking critique as well as like any negative feedback or would like by your head off probably two of  so  I started to be more patient be more open to it and and be okay with making mistakes or not knowing something because if you don't know something will you start learning more about it so end and I think you know  that's something that  always happens in life you know you you you don't want to fail you don't you want to do a good job and sometimes that makes you over protective so %HESITATION  yeah that's something I try to impart now with designs as well like %HESITATION but you need to create an environment where that's okay and and you can do that %HESITATION %HESITATION because sometimes it's it's just hard to to %HESITATION be vulnerable and try a few things but as designs we need to because otherwise we're not going to get to the the right results so that's that's a big one to me that was one of the first things I I need to learn because obviously with back on economics and working in a bank the bank it was right old time I'd like you to best trader ever and amazing in numbers don't lie  yeah so well there's that too with it it's it's a very true %HESITATION so you know it's  designers need to be comfortable with that the uncertainty and %HESITATION and as you as you gain more experience you start to recognize certain patterns %HESITATION at but then patterns shift I mean when I started out there was no I phone yeah like we're we're doing like there was terrible touch screens and keyboards and things like that so it's only apple introduced iPhone all patterns change so you need to there's you need to be %HESITATION you need to adapt to your environment because that's also designed shifts all the time you know hatters shift but do principles shipped  I think principles probably remain more constant at the end of the day %HESITATION %HESITATION I do think they can shift but those shifts are more %HESITATION society level shift %HESITATION %HESITATION bigger shift that you see %HESITATION I mean if you think about it you know ten years ago %HESITATION would you pay stranger to take a ride in a car Sir an old cells no  but today that's normal  it changes you know how society works and behaves in what we think is okay versus not okay and sometimes  in some places that's not okay and then you know it's like the eight years those are interesting shifts that you see %HESITATION and it changes nothing design actually has the power to change some of those but that you know %HESITATION that is something that we don't necessarily control but  I do think that some principles remain fairly constant you can look at designed decades ago and %HESITATION some decides to design still stands %HESITATION %HESITATION and but you know they do shift over time but adaptability I think and and maybe related as just your empathy is something that's designs we should all be comfortable with and and and explore  so  unless you have any other questions the smart yeah so  this next series of questions we reached out to the community and we asked them what's burning in their minds so we've got a few questions that we got from them we're gonna ask every guest this also will kick off with this one how do you explain the role of designed to people in Hoover  so luckily I don't have to do too much explaining %HESITATION that said you still need to communicate and make sure that design frankly has a seat at the table %HESITATION %HESITATION and the way I look at it is  you know you couldn't create any products %HESITATION would like but to get it to the next level to really make it amazing and %HESITATION to get yelled that level of empathy that's necessary you should absolutely leverage your design team at all times because that includes not only how it looks how it works but also you know tons of user research has been done out there %HESITATION for instance I've been actually driving with uber so I've been a dry  ever because I want to understand the the flip side of this as well %HESITATION but would I know what it's like to drive in Mumbai India no I have no idea I need to research to tell me what that looks like what I need to go there myself %HESITATION ill being able to write great content like all the things that %HESITATION the design team can do %HESITATION people sometimes forget cell I think it's up to us to make that visible to again tell our stories again and again like even show the difference between something that was designed well and something that wasn't designed well %HESITATION and I think we can see example of that in in our daily lives in outside of that as well right so %HESITATION I see it as my job at over to tell those stories and to show evidence of those stories %HESITATION because the evidence is what makes or breaks it it's like Hey here's this great prosecuted and here are the results and %HESITATION here's the you know the data behind it like again needs to make sense to to do that so %HESITATION just being an advocate for design %HESITATION  in a company like over is important always Pushin  so the second question speaking about the roles that design can take %HESITATION how was the design organization curly structured over  %HESITATION so obviously we have many things going on at the same time %HESITATION one of the things I noticed when I joined uber is %HESITATION I thought of it as like okay you got rising drivers and that's it  %HESITATION well that's not entirely true it actually %HESITATION  %HESITATION it's %HESITATION it's more complicated than that %HESITATION you lift your list you know Sir like lifting the engine bay and I go okay there's a couple good I've no idea how it works so from things like how do you price things out like how does that even work how do I use it a button and some car move somewhere and come pick you up sounds super simple very complicated  %HESITATION and and we know that people get pissed off when they're you know time of when the car arrived jumps up but %HESITATION you know that whole it's like it's like a entire orchestra that is in the shadows to to make this happen that's what's so fascinating about logistics but the other thing that I realize is that we are in like hundreds of cities  and %HESITATION the one thing that I think is unique about we were as well and as designers we can leverage that is all the folks that and then we call them operations internally ops for short are the folks that make things happen in the cities they understand how their city works what the market looks like %HESITATION they're sort of the the eyes and ears on the ground and I can't really think of other companies that have that type of of knowledge and and and things that can assist and it you know we leverage that %HESITATION so that's pretty fascinating to be able to to take that into account and designed for for that so how does that translate into the teams like we you mention the writer you mention the driver but %HESITATION  so we have the branding %HESITATION and we have what we call  of services %HESITATION because a lot that over is about communicating %HESITATION and how we communicate from emails to all of those things and then there's a core product even the core product team %HESITATION the corporate design team is really in charge of things that you you might see in a familiar with where that's rider driver eats %HESITATION rush hour delivery product and everything %HESITATION since everything over is two sided market place there is %HESITATION there's always the two sides of the coin to any product Anna then we have obviously we're working on a ton of his vehicle so %HESITATION is really in its infancy %HESITATION but you need to think about those things too %HESITATION there's many different aspects of what makes %HESITATION were take and work and how we make bets for the future %HESITATION that we as a design team product design team cover  and most of it is probably unknown to most people like I would imagine most companies have that you know because apple is not just about the iPhone no although we associate most of it with the iPhone or Facebook isn't just about their news feed %HESITATION %HESITATION it's usually how many people it takes to build an amazing amazingly great product  so there are people out there listening to this right now that are the only designer in their company maybe there's one or two other people with them right %HESITATION  how would you get them to show the business the business of their and the value of what they do as designers  so I've been there yep what's amazing is that your values absolutely you  media  because you are the only designer  for him by de facto would you you are the value  %HESITATION the difference is like you know it's it's usually if you're the only designer %HESITATION at the start of for instance even pre launch everything is geared towards getting to that momentous one old product %HESITATION so  yes I remember there were some lonely times because I used to be I DO but had tons of designs around me engines start up I was the only designer right first of all I thought that my %HESITATION started experience word and after three months because it felt like a project but it didn't kept going six months since the year two years %HESITATION  and you start to leverage different things you learn how to become more independent as a designer is designed thinker %HESITATION you you learn how to collaborate very well with product and engineering and probably directly working I mean product is the C. O. probably there's a probably no product managers %HESITATION  is not for everyone %HESITATION and %HESITATION I think it you know it takes %HESITATION I wouldn't recommend it for someone just out of college %HESITATION can't get some experience like you would recommend be the only designer yeah call yeah that would that would be super hard I mean I've been surprised before his folks that can totally do it but %HESITATION but I think it's a different challenge you really it's much more existential in a sense that you're  opening a company get to their first product or even if you've already launched it you are the single point of failure %HESITATION and you'll probably have to make quite a few trade offs and be balanced the you know the desire for for amazing this with an a sense of pragmatism %HESITATION and the trade off exists both in large and small companies  the bounce can shift ever so slightly and the decision you make a difference but %HESITATION ill both as some have a written articles about both have their pluses and minuses %HESITATION %HESITATION and I've enjoyed working in both %HESITATION and they just represent different challenges but I think if you are going to be the only designer at a smaller company %HESITATION think making sure that they understand the value is critical because if not it's going to be pretty frustrating experience  Serbia earlier you spoke about narratives and storytelling as a way to help build excitement for project specially for designer %HESITATION but once that excitement is there and people are bought in the next logical question is what are the goals %HESITATION and what are the results that we're hoping to to produce right %HESITATION how should a designer go about the finding those goals and presenting them  so I think at least from my personal experience %HESITATION with with %HESITATION were you partner closely with the product teams %HESITATION you know you  if you look at the data you look at  different things everything around the design %HESITATION you can just make random bets because at a company like a word that is you know definitely metrics driven someone's gonna ask about it they can say okay tell me you know you're proposing of changing this design  %HESITATION Anil give a quick example like in the old older over experience all products from uber pool too over black to S. U. V. all shown on the same page  we now doesn't scale right but  it obviously gets people nervous when we say no no it's okay we're gonna divided up and it's going to be in sections and is going to be great  sounds good cleans up the interface for sure the next question goes like well how do people get to an S. U. V. like is it discoverable is it not so then we started looking at the data and help people trade often over quarterbacks mostly  order a trade off between look through products  but we also took into account that if you're always riding over black we're not gonna put you in the economy section with over **** Brax that's wrong section for you to starting to use data to actually create meaningful design %HESITATION and that's how you build a case so the goals the design goal should always be aligned with the business schools %HESITATION because if you don't do that you gonna get questions and why not right like I would ask the same questions at some point %HESITATION and it and I think the the the alignment of those goals is what makes it successful and you can get past like you know  thank you know the horrendous feedback of I don't like this design you're like well why don't you like designing you like thirty minutes later you're still not really clear about why a design wasn't working or was working %HESITATION %HESITATION but making sure you build a good case run your design especially in a larger organization where you'll have to again back to selling you need to do some of that selling you need to show why it's it's better %HESITATION %HESITATION there is something looking better I mean as desires as well we'll go for but there's also something working better and just in general being better %HESITATION better is subjective like what's better like I mean if we make more money does better right like I don't care how it looks so %HESITATION you need to combine all of those variables into one so one one follow on to that question %HESITATION you spoke about the design goal should be in alignment with the business goals that makes complete sense %HESITATION it's the best way to like push to those initial friction that you have a stake holders %HESITATION but what happens in this near where the design is not actually aligned with the business goals  that's not a good design  back to the drawing board  %HESITATION I truly believe that  unless your business goals also not good then you have bigger trouble but I I truly believe that I think it's design I mean then you might as well become an artist right like %HESITATION that's where you know you're you're really exploring %HESITATION %HESITATION yourself and and and doing things but I think  I would I would really build a case then why you going against the business school  %HESITATION that's that that could be inching conversation but you have a hard time  missing folks because %HESITATION you know that's also something I learned during my days I DO and after that is like whenever you go out and you talk to a client like never  never just think that they're they make decisions because they're stupid they're not they know their business best so that's the other thing that when working with Travis that I want to really understand she knows this business like no other amazing it's understanding that and being able to still it is another %HESITATION responsibility we have a designer so if you're going against that business school a big business school right because if it's a small one you can make trade offs say like well I am willing to forego two percent here to gain five percent there now now that's interesting and we had some of that at over as well where you know I'm still I'm sure some folks are still frustrated about their pick up location and where's my driver and I'm right here to map says I'm right there so we you know we decided to trade off certain things %HESITATION like speed and making sure your GPS more accurate %HESITATION to get that down the final not a problem is if we do get it wrong  it does piss people off more now %HESITATION %HESITATION so but that's a tradeoff you make so %HESITATION so I think it's either either you're aligned or do you better have a damn good story why you're proposing to change it but you can't as designs we can't come to the table along with that I mean getting it laughed at like I mean I don't spend my days doing sequel query understand it it is expert for that  data analysis product managers that that's their job to like you know make sure this functions correctly self %HESITATION yeah never always always question always go back and  reason why something is why it is sometimes it's silly but yeah they're still reason usually was so we can begin and with this last question  %HESITATION as the role and function of design starts to evolve what are some ideas or methodologies or other roles that you think will emerge over the next five years  I think about this a lot because at times I get disappointed by the tools that were given to me sensually most of his photo shop %HESITATION I personally never really was good at photo shop %HESITATION I see some trends now that are pushing the envelope more %HESITATION %HESITATION and I think it design is gonna you know a lot of people talk about chat bots were still trying to figure out what's actually good about it but I certainly have no interface not really %HESITATION you have an experience so I think what we're you know in this this sounds kind of cookie cutter but I think it's designed really creating experiences at the end of the day %HESITATION the methods we use today are %HESITATION is a phone screen a table cop Bankrate like this allows me to %HESITATION lifted up and and and be able to drink from it %HESITATION not burn my fingers by the way %HESITATION  but you know that is something that continuously evolves right  now we're really  it's phone centric fan's gonna go beyond that you already see with the art yeah it's amazing for games but with love it love it love it this is great but you know %HESITATION and chat bot Cindy everything is shifting around this and we'll have some more good years with with the things in our pocket because they're pretty amazing %HESITATION but I think it's how do we  are we keep up with that and what are some of the things that change %HESITATION because speaking of science fiction you know %HESITATION sure some folks have read ready player one minutes use use use in a suit you're just in a world that is not real anymore it's just I mean it probably feel real %HESITATION and that's where we are going to go at some point but what is that mean but also you can I I think we're gonna see a reaction the opposite ways like kill all technology I'm done with it I'm going to go on a hike somewhere %HESITATION I don't know where it's going to go but I know that right now we're super focused on that phone screen everything you see is about that phone screen %HESITATION I think that's gonna shift so I think designers %HESITATION I mean it's not like you today needs only to think about everything outside because and you know %HESITATION you gonna come back to the office and you're gonna like do also should crazy things and they're asking what's next week %HESITATION but you know I first ten years today now than ever before that it's kind of insane right and %HESITATION figure another ten years will what will be old I'll be really old but we'll probably see here and have a different type of interaction with technology %HESITATION but that's what's so exciting right like you know like a  rolls are redefined I mean if you think about Tom's vehicles  %HESITATION you you remove the driver you remove a big part of the customer experience  saw what is I mean like is it is the car going to talk to you some kind of weird right like this robot talking to you yeah %HESITATION who knows who knows but %HESITATION that's that's the future that that will be very interesting and that's where %HESITATION I we like to think of it experiences in general so as the interface attrition is the experience will continue to be king is absolutely yeah I think that never change their some well you know you can't really replace  a good dinner by away that's also an experience %HESITATION  I hope so can take the food out of the dinner  we've we've tried try and they're still trying but it's it's about experiences I I truly believe that and and people are willing to %HESITATION to do interesting things angle long ways to have great experiences well thank you so much thank you  Hey you made it to the end congratulations thanks for watching
