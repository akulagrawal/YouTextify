how the someone knows that no good to how the someone know that they could suit in order to be good at something you need to practice that scale but in order to judge whether you are good at something you just kinda needs experience I'm so if you work in software development for a long time near exercise your design skills you can still understand you about it to overtime like you get a more mobile sense of just how bad you are  is if you actually exercise their skills you'll you'll get even more experience and you will see how bad you are compared to your idea of perfection what you think stops developers from eighty one because I mean that's a common thing why don't you do decide I'm terrible design or what like when we do design Spence's like you tell people that one point %HESITATION you have to sketch and everyone panics Kongtrul is like you can if you try a little bit I think that is the the gap between skill and experience if you work in software development I'm you will you will  come to understand what a good design looks like just by working with design is you all get you'll see designs the works he designs that don't work you'll get a good feel for what work and then if you try that yourself it won't be as good you'll narrow from your experience that your your design is not is not good enough and %HESITATION or at least feel that isn't good enough and that will  put your from trying the future there's no point icon design you know I shouldn't questions even bother so the  the thing a developer needs to do if they want to be if I had to be in to do the design same time  is just practice just do it do even though you'll know that it's bad  %HESITATION because over time you will get good yeah and you might still think you're bad but that's fine you're in the practice of doing even though you think you're at some point in this with venom in Korea and I mean I don't ask you for your good design about this one you have is of unique so I feel like I'm a really bad design a and I think that's because I have a lot of experience and I have never personally really taken back leak in %HESITATION progress my skills are least on certain kinds of design certainly laying out to web page I like I I know how to mechanically will make the web page look like a design that I've been given but I couldn't produce that design like am I a I don't have that visual imagination but I'm nervous because I haven't exercised that skill and places where I have exercised skill in things small like user interaction I'm  those places I feel I can do a better job you know I I E.  I know I'm not an expert but I also know that I'm  better than none at not being done by anyone yeah I mean again this S. expose the thing which I'm still frustrates me that you're developing you've done the venom stuff quite on time you know the process of learning it's like once you've learned something you realize that the kind of  this isn't a magic that takes to being good at something %HESITATION it's just time by and time and effort so as a as a developer Mike I don't buy it that I'm not creative by yeah writing software is a creative process today it just uses very different techniques to arm visual design all use our inspectors to focus on I am so it's not the creativity that I feel that I like is just that time served during the designs seeing what was wrong going back and doing it like here to practice practice practice semi I do agree that %HESITATION  creativity there's a quite different coding but is on what is the thing that  a stop someone from wanting to explore so there are several reasons why I might or might not want to go on to be the design or what is just I'm like practicality if you have a designer that you can lean on Yahoo why not I mean that that is a that is a perfectly valid choice and say you know I don't have the skills and rather than spending time getting those skills I can just take someone who does have their skills and we can build a symbiotic relationship I'm I don't think that's necessarily good long term in your current you should have some design skills you should have at least an understanding of what the designers during you should do some stuff I also know that my time is limited  and I could spend time honing my craft as a developer or as a designer  and photo lots of people I am the choice will be just to stick with what you now it's %HESITATION it's not even about like natural ability I think it  Kelly about comfort zone so yeah I I know that I will get better as a designer if I try  and  for me it's just being that I've never particularly had the impetus to try at least on visual design  I am the more recently I have been I see trying to be a better design %HESITATION in less visual things for the video stuff you be welcomes more interaction design exactly so %HESITATION working %HESITATION with web via I have to %HESITATION place things in the scene said that they %HESITATION will make sense to the viewing when things could be out of your line of sight you need you need to draw people's attention to the correct things you need to make things show that things it's obvious how to interact with things you need to design your experience and understanding the limitations of %HESITATION like the hardware things you don't have someone spinning around too fast you don't have someone moving too much if the if the headset isn't gonna recalled the movement %HESITATION because there's a lot of things that will just make the the use of feel L. so you have you have design constraints as well as technicals constraints and you have to work to those I guess the trick is just to plow arm when you lost it when your bad  and it's easier at the beginning of your career because you don't understand you about  I don't see what the so much patience in the beginning and the end you think well this most of the stuff you have to have it says yeah I guess you also need the the the feeling of safety to put yourself out that with something that  I am you're pretty Shaw isn't gonna be goods but to be able to put that design out to your team and say look here's what I came up with the macum working in the future without feeling like you're going to be marked or ridiculed by a T. makes yeah %HESITATION so just having a supportive team can help  I think it's so much a design is so much it's problem solving right so %HESITATION so many people forget that when I think of design I think of the finished product but there's so many different stages of how you got to the finished product
