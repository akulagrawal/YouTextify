hi I'm outside a cafe at the Google office in Mountain View California and we're about to see how guerrilla usability testing with as few as five users can help you find up to eighty five percent of the core usability problems in your app come on let's go take a look  thank you for stopping by I'm working with a client on a mobile application and a minute I'll show you the application and I'll ask you some questions about it it'll take about ten minutes as you go through the application I want you to think aloud to voice whatever you're thinking or feeling as you look through it please be honest this is a test of the application not if you are  time out  usability testing as a lot of fun and it's one of the most effective tools you have to improve the quality of your app or website in fact it doesn't matter if it's an app a website a remote control or door usability simply means that people can use the thing for its intended purpose and here's one fun and simple way to conduct a really usability testing go to a fairly popular cafe ask people to tester out for ten minutes and then give them a small treat as a thanks it's a great way to spend an hour okay time in  the great news is that you only need to talk to five users to find eighty five percent of the core usability problems your most important usability problems are easy to spot for people who are new to your application and difficult for you to spot because you no longer have fresh eyes you're too close to the product to know how real people perceive it for the first time  good news  sin is a usability testing pioneer who led extensive research to arrive at the magic five users number it turns out that you learn a lot from the first person you talk to a little less from the next and so forth after the fifty user you're wasting your time by observing the same findings repeatedly but not learning much new  you can use our ready made template to customize your survey and print out a sign for the cafe next decide who will go one or two people is the perfect number you don't want to have more than three people because it may make your tester feel uncomfortable everyone involved in your product should go at some point this includes your designer developer product manager executive customer service people etcetera you want to choose a nice reward to gift your testers like a gift card to the cafe or buy them a drink or dessert  people for a loan are easy to ask and remember after five people you're done  the think aloud method is critical for getting inside the user's head it means asking the user to speak out loud everything they are thinking for example they should be saying things like this looks like a news app I wonder how I can get it to show me the sports news maybe if I tap here that's where I think it might let me select the category %HESITATION that loaded pretty slowly etcetera  be sure to take good notes of what people say some clear patterns will emerge from the feedback you get back home you can fix these usability problems and what's critical is that you then come back to the cafe to validate that users no longer face these issues are I well I think we're done so now that we're finished you have any questions for me  it was %HESITATION interesting I hope the feedback is helpful thank you so much  and now it's your turn you now have a new tool in your belt to make your app even more awesome go on  try this out in the real world you can customize our template and questionnaire to suit your app I'm forced missus with the Google developer relations team thanks for watching
