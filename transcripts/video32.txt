by Margaret Kelsey and this is the sixteenth episode of design talks web in our series brought to you by invision today debate Darman team shares with us the one type of user research that will transform your company let's listen in  X. Margaret thanks for having me it's %HESITATION it's an honor to be here so yeah let's kick off by saying a few things about myself right that it helps a little bit to say who the speaker is concerned ability and I want to start by but it's it's it's it's an honor to be here and and kind of made me think a little bit back up to the challenges of art of the possible people ask me so they'd what exactly do you do right so I kind of see myself as a person that's with both products my background is very heavily productive worked on interfaces and  experiences for quite a long time but equally up I've done a lot of work in marketing so I kind of see myself really there like in the mid in and and and yet these whips with hard earned and I'm with my work as a consultant in the past this has been I think a big advantage and at the same time the more we work with both product and marketing teams it's it's interesting to see how I think more and more people are going to start working out at the cross section between the two and so that's kind of what I kind of call like a technical markets and or or or a marketing designer right so it's it's interesting to see how these two words are working together so in terms of of my backgrounds and as I said I'm passionate both product and marketing of work for consulting for quite a long time and I said I've ended up specializing in gross so pretty much making changes that are expected to have an impact on the bottom line at least being able to measure them %HESITATION and and in the context of my career over the last kind of decades of launched a lot of tests right Sir actually measuring these changes to see what the impact was and and I've been lucky enough to work with some really awesome brands huge Browns global brands and yet been lucky enough to be trusted to kind of delivered to them so wins but also some some not so wins rights and someone else is what  but that's how we learn so that more recently I am also the CEO and founder of hard during  and how does is used quite a lot will overturn the thousand sites now we're growing quite fast and also we've been lucky that business wise of also performed really well and and the businesses is growing %HESITATION quite fast and I don't mention these things to kind of show offer anything but in a way it's a testimony of what we're going to look at today right that's the methodology that's kind of influence how we've been the best business and some of the winds we sat and but also like to say that and why some of the content you're gonna look at today will feature a chore it's what I'm talking about days not about such a right so there's as many of you know there's many tools out there that you can use but obviously hundred US feature parts of the content that I talk about purely because and let's see my career influenced me or inspired me to build hearts are right so it's it's kind of and pretty much very well connected with with with who I am so yes so I'm on the notes I'll stop the webcam because I know that's not the most interesting things to look after them and let's jump into the slides  so what to do was actually starts with  my evolution right so let's give some kind of context and and the story behind where I kind of started off in this journey to discover this methodology right this idea of using user research to transform businesses so in the very beginning when I started off in my career some of you might identify with this but you typically starts being obsessed with aesthetics and styling how things look and I've worked with many businesses that are kind of tend to focus on the stage as well like with projects called project slick or whatnot maybe you've heard that before and I then moved on to to build a team and start doing more testing and be more focused on the numbers and measuring the impact so we do a lot of lay out to what's called multifarious testing thank god it's not that much in vogue anymore it's it's this idea of splitting like it experiencer page into different areas and then putting in multiple variations for each and this kind of gave us wins but it gives good results but it tends to kind of  end up with diminishing returns and then the next phase of what I see is my evolution was a kind of this this parts where I started to discover the impact of copy right of text and how important it is to the experience and and and the design that sense right on the results at the end of the day and at the same time it was also focused on okay if we can't have tests they give us great results let's do more tests right but actually it was interesting that during this phase of my career actually realize that more tests actually gave us worse results overall because we were just so focused on velocity and then came the last phase right which is kind of what we're going to be talking about today which was really  M. start to focus more on user feedback listening to the users and and then spending more time to to compile that research I know many of you are probably have done this  and basically doing bigger changes in bigger which in today's session we're going to be talking about  how you can do user research in a very simple way and still have big impact it doesn't need to be very complex research so yeah  what did I learn throughout the journey  the first one is the best practices sock rights and and the thing is it's so easy to get caught in this trap which is %HESITATION this big brand that this sort of %HESITATION look at this awesome experience maybe we should do its rights but it's essentially a mistake to think what others have done might actually work for you purely because obviously you have different challenges and even if it is a competitor your customer base our user base is probably still quite different your legacy as a company is different and who you are as a pro this different right so obviously stealing tactics or or copying other people is typically a good idea the problem is and this is the marketing side of me speaking is that there's so many people out there writes that in the roles that they're building contents which is interesting and what their blogs to do really well right so unfortunately there's so much and kind of investment into building these awesome best practices  the second thing I learned is that there is simply too much data and I'm by this I mean we kind of live in the face of big data but it's may be so big that it's to the point where we kind of still sometimes lose contact with with kind of reality right in the things that are are important will be called the more qualitative sites and  and then this is interesting coming from the right the see of a software company the other thing that I learned is that the best tools are actually free and what do I mean by this like I noticed there was a phase where and myself and my team actually spent too much time stuck behind screens and and tools and looking at data and and it's easy to forget that actually the most important thing of all if you're going to do anything with it should be to listen to observe and actually speak your customers and your users right so so the empathy part is really important thank god no one has yet found a way to put the subscription around these right so it's important for us to remember that this should be the thing we should be focusing on week a week day on day  so  because of these three key learnings M. I found that in order for to keep myself coming on track and focused and I want to develop a methodology for my team and this is something that evolved over time which would give me what I call the big picture now what do I mean by big picture it's it's a simple concept %HESITATION it's it's it's the equivalent of if if like if we consider what we're doing within their organizations but the brand but at the end of the day improving experiences impacting the bottom line in some way it's it's kind of like a game right and let's see if you were playing chess it's really difficult to make that next move towards a win if you come see the full board so in a way the big picture approach this methodology is all about making sure you're always keeping your your eye on the on on on on the big picture in the things that really matter and what I found is that it's effective to kind of break down this big picture to three areas so no matter whether it's a size zero sites it could be an apt and whatever the experience is there is always three kind of and let's say points right there's one entry points and to exit points in the end of the day so the M. two points is basically all about drivers so what is bringing visitors to your site what is bringing users to your app why are people actually taking the time investing their time to kind of use what you have been or what you've you've created and and these digs deep right so here with drivers are going to look soon what this actually means but we're talking about getting to know the person is and what exactly are the challenges that they're facing and I'm if if there are if they're telling us that what the needs  is it really like we don't stop there we actually dig deeper and understand like what they're actually looking for is a hold writer  what is actually needed for them to hang a picture on the wall right so so the drivers is digging deeper understanding that background because that gives context and  what is body is right so it's the second point which is an exit points and typically most people that come to us the hard during like to use the tool they typically focus on is what their people leaving where they're not doing what I expected them to do and this is important rights but it's it's both the where and the white and so it's it's understanding which are your pain points and I'm right where it's not necessarily a page for rights it's it's we're kind of what stage and and what what what was it the trigger it it's and the why of its rights like what was the reasoning and the third point is actually the one which I found is the least understood and the least kind of actually investigated which is what I call hoax so what is it that persuaded your users are visitors to do what they actually did it rights was it's kind of your pricing was it the bread was that the design was it a mixture of these things and what I like to think about is like painting this picture is is kind of very powerful to have all these three elements visible at one go for both you and your team it's very effective for you to understand when you're making the small tactical changes to have this kind of backdrop and and its impact the the the decisions you make so obviously beautiful design skills here right so I still still manage to use Photoshop every now and then and basically the idea is we do this methodology we did been touch are from all the things that we did learn rights working in the in in this industry and we want to teach our own dog food right so what we've done is if if we're kind of trying to build up to and and the methodology that we want our used is to use that we should use that are set up so what I wanted to share with you today is basically what we've done a charger actually using the to ourselves so looking at recordings of people actually using larger doing surveys with them and actually doing funds to see where people are dropping off so this is just quick examples and basically by doing this it  allow this to build what we call the big picture worksheets now if you are interested in having this kind of template you can just go get a big picture worksheets are big picture hajj are there's a PDF that you can use I find this to be extremely powerful to have printed out here my office and and basically we went through the exercise our sense of using not just how much are right there are multiple other tools like views for example you're going to take some extra hundred kind of gets to filling out this worksheet  and I don't have the time today to go into all these details but the slides will be sure to do so it's interesting to see kind of what the big picture looks like for a larger as a company but I want to pick up on one particular use case right because today we're talking about %HESITATION user research can transform your business right so I wanted to take one example from here and just show you how powerful this thing can so I'm going to  also you to look in the bottom right corner here where we have a top three fears or concerns right and this is kind of part of the whole specter it's so what are the reasons that persuaded them to convert but also in the process what was it that nearly stopped them right nearly stopped and that's so powerful to discover it was interesting that we discover that was cost and price we were surprised in a way you're right because hunters quite the for the bill yes our plans for bigger at new data needs to go higher but it was interesting to see that so we were kind of surprised so let's dig deeper rate because we didn't expect to see that there and so we looked at our pricing page we said okay so this is the page were pretty much all pricing decisions and opinions are kind of being formed right this is kind of the gate twenty where someone who's deciding whether to use or journal to the value waiting our pricing and someone who used to using the app is coming back here to evaluate which plan to go rights okay this is a good place to start so we decided to ask a very simple and straightforward question on this page and  the question was this super super is our pricing clear and if not what would you change and this is something that we as you can imagine set up literally within minutes and we had to replace coming in instantly and was really really interesting start seeing what our users have to say not typically when I speak to people use our during I I show than this the typical objections they have is all my god it looks so ugly or oh my god I don't want to interrupt my users or oh my god this might suspects conversion rates stuff right but the reality is that I can actually disapproval three well maybe that it's not likely because that is quite subjective and but at the end of the day  whether this looks good or not and and its objective to think how it impacts kind of the experience in the end you really cannot afford to not know what your visitors are thinking right so think of it as a small time window where you're reaching out and asking a question maybe it's not the most amazingly elegance and sophisticated aesthetically pleasing way of doing it but it gets the job done right and it's important to understand this because then you can go back and have a big impact on on the experience so let's look at how this impacted us so what was interesting was the besides the poll we also did he did something that we typically do and it's also a tip we also gifts essentially it's kind of examining a page in the way kind of how it's being used at the same time wire people using it the way they do and it's kind of it's kind of looking at something from two different angles anything it's powerful because I kind of cooling call this process connecting the dots writes what are they doing and what are they saying the first this was insane because basically what we discovered was that in the feedback everyone was talking about one area which is what we call it snapshots right it's it's the size or the amount of data that you records when you're creating say I keep that purports or form reports or collecting like video replays recall the recordings of what people are doing on your in your app or in your site  it was interesting you see that red area there and he laughed was interesting was that consistently there was always a lot of attention specifically on what is called the song or the data collection right which are two very different things we're saying hold on where people speaking so much about this aspect but that interacting and and kind of typically we don't see that typically we see alignment so is it okay that's that's the deeper so so we spoke to some of our users and basically what they said to us was they were completely confuse  they were so confused  they didn't even realize that they were completely two different dimensions the way we price and what's interesting was that we were equally confused because we had no idea that this was happening and it's interesting because as a company we consider ourselves to be close to our customers we speak to them and that's where we invested heavily into supports we we keep records of what people say to us but because  they didn't know what they did in their own right they couldn't give us this feedback so it's quite interesting that just by looking at this in in the way we did we uncovered this really confusing confusing discovery  so what did we do  we jumped in we looked at some recordings of actually people interacting with this page to see what was the flow what did they do before what were they doing after and that was interesting to give us some empathy we actually had some and use the tests and in this case moderated right so we were kind of doing the remotely asking them to to basically show us the pricing and they show us in the app what they thought what's meant walks and this obviously the more we dug deeper the more we were literally shocked that kind of we had missed this completely  so the big question is what do we do about that's right this is the transformation parts and this is really important right because you can't have the insights but you need to do something with it so  we're lucky because obviously we created the methodology and we are the founders of the business and it's part of our DNA  it's it's part of our culture's values to kind of act on feedback in put feedback at the center of the way we run the business sonar case the first thing we did was pretty much in our next quarterly review we said okay let's look at our product roadmap it's the kind of take road map let's rethink how we can make this much more intuitive and I'm I'm basically rethink completely also the way we price the products are then this is not a small thing it's it's a it's a huge thing  we also though did not wait to kind of just through the big stuff right that is more long term basis said okay let's look at all the other questions we had on this pulled right so we austere member the question was if you have any question like what was it like what is confusing so we said let's address pretty much every question that we got on the page and the way we did was we split down the responses by percentage so if if for example forty percent  of all of the responses relates to one query then let's let's really get forty percent of all kind of the area on the page dedicated to this kind of consent right so it kind of we waited and how we kind of changed the experience to the feedback that we were getting the big impact we also started working on a new in app experience and pricing structures so we've just announced this to our user base this week so it's it's really exciting am and and one thing which is huge in the experience in itself which is if people are struggling with this and they don't understand our Jr works then we'd leave really need to make it effortless right intuitive and so what we're doing is we're invested quite a lot of at Dave resources not didn't just building a feature this time or functionality but actually showing how the product is collecting data and putting our user in our customers in control of kind of of the limit so we hope that this at least based on the feedback we're getting from users we hope that this was a big impact on on how they understand the product is working  besides that we also organize the hackathon were reluctant to pricing structure with not so we literally met up we flew we're remote company right so we have people all over the world but we few people in small talk we spent some time in the office and we looked at how can we quickly create  solutions together and then literally jump on on a call with our customers and our users and get there quick reaction and then and and change from there  so in other words what I'd like to call this and this is an important theme from a transformation standpoint is that we actually give a damn right and this is important because there's two things that I want to leave with you today which is the user research methodology aspects right so it's a two one it's a powerful way to identify opportunities for improvement and the second thing is a way of thinking which is actually giving it up now most of you might be thinking how the hell can I do this from my team writes in a big organization how my gonna bring all these things together and I think there's two things that I can say which is one bring people with you when you work on this type of project so use tools and where you can actually bring the team on board so obviously I don't advertise Roger but to the culture for the week kept the team in mind so don't kind of isolate yourself as a team and use a tool like cooking at six hard earned mixed kind and %HESITATION any survey tool right and and and isolate the people and and sit on that data so invite people to join you visualize it for them creates meetings and events where you can share this right we had uses a hardware that sent the photos and videos of them where they organize small in turn of events and where they kind of shows the power of this this insights and actually visualize how people were actually really using the site that what they have to say and and many people in the team were shocked by what was our coverage right so bring people with you and then second find the champion rights so governance's importance by governance we mean find like a V. P. anti rector someone who is high up and hopefully involved in both product marketing support someone who can actually a champion this concept for you right and then in the end rights if if your organization is not giving a damn and you're the only one giving at them then yeah I think you know what you need to do and so how can this work for you rights I don't want to just give you this example and say Hey we're do  amazing stuff so I want to give you some some really specific examples and the questions you can be asking to build and this kind of worksheets for yourself and identify these opportunities so  let's look at how we can put the three pillars of the practice so first is drivers right so ownership with you some of the questions which are kind of my favorite the one that I've worked the best for me so I'd like to ask how can we make this page better how can we make this experience better might seem like a very simple question but having tried many variations actually leading with a hollow and seeing better kind of you're not raising the bar too high and it's a very easy entry points to see like where where they feel like they we can kind of be changing experience from raising the bar and second question is what exactly did you first hear about this something you might be thinking why is this important it's important because it gives you context rights of like you can literally visualize the journey of how they exactly came to here right so it actually gives you important information about kind of the chain of events that led up to the experience and gives you again that big picture of okay so this person's coming from that background or the company didn't we getting people are hearing from there and there and you might be seeing but yeah whether textiles they can give me source right but this is not fixed not it's not the same thing rights so this allows you to understand like what are the influencers on people kind of coming to you  and then finally why are you looking for solution today right where are you looking for this type of experience today so this allows you to understand that the war of the challenges that they are facing where are they coming from writes a dig deeper Elizabeth into and kind of the root cause of of why why they're actually using your ex your your site your app  in terms of targeting like who would you go off to here so this is where you want to go with with pages or areas of your app or site or pages from your site where you are seeing the most activity rights or where you have the biggest entry points and the reason being is you want volume responses here if you want a lot of people kind of giving your replies you wanna try showing the question quite quickly so for example five seconds so you don't want this to be delayed door triggered by specific events you want to be quite quick naturally you're gonna get a small amount of people might say Hey give me a second I'm just getting started or you might actually get some kind of %HESITATION very interesting let's say yeah creative responses but obviously you just put those aside and and focus on the value that you're getting  barriers and my favorite questions here quick question what stops you from signing up to date what stopped you from actually adding this to the court's what stopped you from creating this reports right this  it's pretty much unlimited now you can adapt to steer business taken action or an event that is important to you or or related to a project that you might be working on analyst what stop them from doing that's right and  the second question is what are your main concerns or questions about could be the brand name it could be a feature it could be a piece of functionality rights so it's it's good again to to dig deep on a human level like what are your concerns what questions do you have and you'd be really surprised how with this question works and you might again be asking is if I get this quite often like people want reply to this the reality is our serves as people who wore the builders and creators of the optimizer is we don't typically kind of fits in to the to the target group of people to reply to these questions but you'd be surprised especially with fans of people who love your to your to your solution what you've been how much they want to actually help you improve it so you'd be really surprised by the response rates  in terms of target things would you go off there so I'd say target pages with the biggest drop in in fun and so I find it is basically where you map out kind of the steps to go from start to end right so you can you can clear the funded in any way you want to pending on what you're trying to achieve so identify the step for you are getting the biggest drop off and then I asked the question there so in our case right so we look to people that we're going from home page sign up sign up steps registration going inside the app that may be creating a heat map so we identified where were the biggest drop off points in in that journey  and then we ask these questions there start by showing the question when users are abandoning I'd like to start from there so most survey type tools they allow you to show a question when actually someone is showing intends to leave or abandon the page and or also the to the lights kind of for those of you are more technicians kind of loss of control this from a Java script point of view reserve if you're using up  let's say I'm  a single page app and someone is leaving an experience you can answer your that's rights and so that's a great way to start if you don't get responses than just increase that and and maybe go for more blankets approach of hitting getting more people  I'm fine the hawks so quick question what persuaded you to sign up to add this to your car to use this functionality to upload a photo to download the software right so it's really important to dig into what are the persuasion points this is really powerful and  and then thanks for whatever you did how are you planning to use its right again so this is the whole and understanding what is the root cause rights and this this definitely allows us to also for example Taylor the experience and so that we pretty much make it more specific to the use cases that they mention right quick example here is working with an ecommerce sites and I help them set up some polls rights to understand and how they were planning to kind of use the bicycles that they were sending it was interesting that we identified some interesting themes around wait and and and this sparked a lot of ideas for them to kind of create and let's say tools were you can input your way ten type of space you have at home and how you're gonna use it and kind of give you recommendations right this is what we need to be thinking about which is making that experience effortless and intuitive as much as possible  and then targeting wise %HESITATION to reach how do we get these answers solvency target the thank you pages or our success pages are sexist steps and but again sure the lady you don't wait too long the quicker you get this response the more fresh the experiences in their minds and and you can target multiple thank you pages using like contains all schools have this right so you can kind of expand this to kind of look at multiple different experiences and group them together  so I also want to leave you with some interesting tips within the school within this context so I mentioned this already find or be the champion for change really important especially if you're struggling or think you're going to struggle within your organization to get this done and  show what you have described the discover to the organization help them empathize with empathy is a key key theme here put them in the shoes of the user show them are they using the product and what they have to say and you're fine the champions team work together  and also create a task force him to to build your big picture together I tossed force meaning and open up to let's say if you're in products to people in marketing and supports to to kind of come together this this big picture together  yes Sir can more tactical %HESITATION tip don't force on says into buckets when asking questions you sometimes it's actually interesting of I've seen this tip which is used you start with the kind of %HESITATION %HESITATION I'm a multiple of kind of a multiple choice question or like a  billion kind of question in order to get things started so did you like this experience yes and no and then you follow up depending on yes or no with a question for that but at the end you always want to be be collecting like these big white boxes right so qualitative juicy comments right because you need to be able to read this in order to truly empathize  and this is the boring parts but it's a good tip you then download the replies what I talked about before and you start kind of marketing them  by seem to see on the top and what I usually do is I read quickly through let's say one hundred two hundred responses and then %HESITATION I start to identify the themes and then I read through them again and start putting them into each call that  this is kind of a little bit of a painful things actually not %HESITATION we're we're really starting to kind of try to type with ideas of how we can put this directly into the survey itself that's something I look forward to and and yeah and then use the exact same words your user using the replies right in this is interesting  whether you're in marketing our products or or or or support like the ability to connect with your user is when your ex explaining something to make sure the kind of the experience connects and it's really important to also look at what are the exact words that using one of the phrases they use and and and for example I highly highlighted the mains here and this is an interesting example through that same poll we looked at before that survey we asked on the page on our pricing page we saw that everyone was pretty much saying the maids but we say sites and on our site so that was interesting and it was interesting to dig into the support matrix and to see we had so many questions also they're asking us like how many the maze can I use this on so that was that was an interesting discoveries which  so so yeah so we've come to the end I just want to summarize with five confinement take aways and we can open up for questions and as we said best practices suck for the really big wins and by winds I mean whether to split the story change or transforming the business right first get to know your users get that big picture and  connect the dots between analytics and feedback and the ability to look at an experience from both what people are doing and why they're doing it is is really valuable  %HESITATION yourself to be surprised and ask questions investigates follow up face to face really don't be scared to get out there you'd be surprised how many of your users are really came to help you out  give quick feedback on your new concepts by speaking to users I'm assuming most of you already knew that already do this my point would be too early like we do in our thoughts right just jump in there as quickly as you can  dear find the champion to bring the whole organization with you supervisor was super important M.  I finally give a damn right in the end I could you don't act on the feedback and insights you collect it's kind of pointless right and as I said and put yourself in a position in an organization in a role where you actually can get at that  and that's it  fantastic so we're right up at the top of the hour  so unfortunately that's all the time we have today but David thank you so much and a big thank you to everyone who attended today I hope you have a great rest of your day and keep designing awesome things  brilliant thanks so much for having me it's been a pleasure here we're huge fans so it's been an honor as I said in one of you out there in the spirit of feedback I'd love to hear from you on Twitter so connect with me sure feedback if you have questions that we did not today feel free to ask me directly love to hear from you thanks again
