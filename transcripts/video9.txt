this call for will call on you with my opinion  design if you tip and invited us basically to get you and we are sitting in the  his ability Latin yep amazing live he's great Adams yes first of all just introduce yourself sure sure yeah %HESITATION so like you said my name is mark and me and this is our usability lab welcome this is where we test all the humans in use even try to figure out what what they love or hate about you too %HESITATION so I've been a designer you should know about two years okay and prior to that I had a start up called flick yeah and %HESITATION school decided to acquire flick in our team and that's kinda brought me brought me here %HESITATION I worked on all parties to rest on the player road we worked on the redesigned last year %HESITATION currently I'm working on TV and some cool stuff with iPad and iPhone so yeah that's kind of what I do cool %HESITATION so you mentioned that you were up for you you should not to yes but you also work for start ups  what do you think it's like the biggest difference where I'd like you to buy everything you do  as such a big impact like has such a  huge user base like to like it's not awakened build everything from space like how you want it right yeah I think this is it this is this is an interesting problem for designer I think a lot of designers want this %HESITATION depends what kind of person you are there some folks so when I get  I get a blank wall skin in my hands I get X.  I love this I love the idea of starting from scratch in creating whatever I want and as a start up you can do that you can see a need and you can build something from scratch I can open up photo shop at in in this is actually one of my core strength I'm very good at imagining new apps new ways of doing things okay and so coming to you too we Google itself has very intuitive process almost iterate your way out of a steak if you make a mistake no problem with just an array of out of it in one of the challenges we have is the design work we do here are small changes in overtime those small changes add up to something very very big very huge but  like you said because of our large user bases we have to really we can't just like tomorrow we couldn't change all of you to search for example if we said all right when you type in the query for lady Gaga all of a sudden we totally change the results we do a big grid view and we do something or maybe we just are playing a lady Gaga video I don't know like we can't do that right because we have these sticks that our users are dependent on you to turn around five or six years now Google search of course has laid out some very kind of best practices for search you type something in you kind of expect you know kind of a title link that'll in description you in in a kind of linear way and that that designates order and so you know we have these debates of like what happens if we put search resort result was on all and we bring him into a lot like this and we do not tracking study turns out we do things was on %HESITATION you you can watch people's eyes they just go crazy because there's no order they  don't know is this result the best one or the second is the best one in so for something like search for you to search  as we make changes to that they're very small on the very subtle you know maybe we had duration to a thumbnail see you know how long that will be in turns out duration helps like if you're looking for music video you can be like oh that video that is twenty minutes long that's probably not the music video but this one the three minute that's probably it will play with the size of the title or shrink it down allowed in the description or maybe some other metadata and so as as a designer when you have those kind of constraints there's  %HESITATION some joy in that but there's also some frustration as you just want you want something dynamic and rich and beautiful and I think the other problem that designers have is this idea of ego like you feel like you need to solve all the world's problems and so sometimes  sometimes it incremental changes doesn't feel like you're making a big enough then in the universe and %HESITATION but you are you have to kind of take a step back in and realize you know that small change for example we made a change on our player we get to the end of a of a video we we used to have one two or maybe three videos we change that about sums sometime last year we went to just a big red of videos and turns out our users love that a lot more choice it especially if you're in full screen yet ten of a video you how you can see a lot of the related videos that are up next and that drove a lot of engagement I was a really good thing and up it is a small thing takes it took half a second to design it in Photoshop but made a big impact and so anyway so it so start up is better he's not  better it's just different it's it's very engaging and rich arm but it's it but you know when your product his maturity like used to the different kind of designed solely in what interests me is like for you to be you don't have to like  Dr use this to you to sign up yep them all kind of  so we have now we do we have the challenges right like how do we get people to use our I owe our iOS app how do we get people to use we have we have you to bond PlayStation three how do we get you just use that it's the same challenge just like on a massive scale yeah but is this do you think this is a design challenge %HESITATION a use it is experience challenge I think so yeah I think so I think a lot of it depends on so take our iOS app for example yeah you know how do we how do we let users know that when they go to iOS six they need to get you to back up on there so you know we run we have if you I don't know if you've got an dot YouTube dot com which is our mobile web experience we'll put a banner at the top okay by the way we have an iOS app that you might want to download the to better engagement so we do the same we have to do the same kind of things everybody does forwarding we see we have a marketing team that spent a lot of time cracking our messages you know buying advertisement using our same tools to come get the message out we're not we're not immune to you know the the rules of marketing getting getting of what's out there I think I thought like competitors yeah actually competitor is in informs in terms of the I. O. S. six need you at yeah I later things coming up there there's a look good %HESITATION there's  so many cool one of the one one of the great things but you too because you know we have this wonderful ecosystem of developers who are making beautiful  kind of like the the the take the take are you too baby on the bill beautiful they like their show you an and dragon tape there's all these really cool interesting mash ups that they do I mean there's one that I have for my kids called we will end and all it is is they've just curated like kid videos so it's really safe it's like super safe you to for my  %HESITATION I mean you seems pretty safe but not like for like a four year old yeah so you know it's funny because the design is so so but the experience is really great I can no I just tell my son we don't go to you tube go over here to this little out by having his iPad in it and I know he's not gonna get some crazy you know gone gone style  Nicki Minaj made some other crazy thing not no offense I love gun guns Stalin making me not big fans and not for my four year old little bit too much %HESITATION so so that's great like I love seeing that %HESITATION seen people innovate there %HESITATION when we designed it you too we have a broad we're designing for the world you have to you know we have to design for the cat video that we have to design for the protester  over in Egypt and we have to design for the the Khan academy's people who try to change road of education that we have to design for I don't know breaking bad or some TV show or so it's that's really challenging to create a platform that can handle any video of for any purpose you can't you can't be a reverent you can't be too serious you  happy you can almost have to get the heck out of the way in that the video really shine so  if you just mentioned innovation  and I just saw today like then you eBay a design came up and  I think stumble upon as well they all at this interests silent now that all in the masonry the big yellow phone what do you think about that like yeah thank you copy cat a lot because it it looks like you people like it they can just as you like people of it so we copy it and it's like basic myspace myspace through the new myspace also Pinterest so so I think what people I don't know I think they could the confusion is the the reason people love Pinterest yeah is because it allows individuals to create collections in the show those collections and when I share my collection of really cool maybe I have a collection of really beautiful book covers and if I know that our Pinterest I share it with you and and then I get feedback from you know like to thank you so much have such an inspiration you kind of stroking my ego there so I think one other folks clone the you why they kind of are forgetting so free day for example I think it's great that they've now with everything out big beautiful pictures I think pictures art communicate so much more than a title camp however what I'm looking for you know I I can't you know five D. canon camera specifically I search in an  I mean they're just different parts your brain I'm I may see a whole bunch of SLRs I mean to be honest like I don't know enough about can't miss it does distinguished that's the five D. that the sun  in the that's the Nikon I just don't know I'm not that hard core of the camera do you and so I need like the title and stuff and to be Frank when you do a big mystery lay out on eBay you you limit the number of results you can have by the fold I mean truly when you have like this and so I don't know in which one of those is the most important so if I search for something on eBay and returns everything a big red how do I know what is most relevant they're kind of during that line a little bit so I love for this that is so beautiful like I'm I mean for me yeah like killer like this is out of a hole in %HESITATION it's for a browser discovery experience I don't quite know what I want I think a great works really well but I think what we've learned is when you want something specific I think lists work much better okay %HESITATION in in like even I don't know if you've used the new %HESITATION when you search for apps on your I phone now it's just like a big tile okay have you seen this thank you new market store so yeah you go to the apps store you search for the U. to you about to download it and it's just a big tile then you have to swipe might get another one yeah you swipe the unknown well  I think is beautiful and is from a visual design aspect I think it's much better but did I was want to list like give me like ten at a time on the screen I was want to scan in so when a tentative time I can scan a lot faster than light giant big blocks  so do you know they're straight officer and so I think  as a designer you have to be very honest with yourself on when you're putting crap in just a poor crop in this beautiful it's like when you learn how to do a drop shadow in Photoshop you like say  quicken loans flared up this so killer and like  no date is terrible like you don't need to make everything look like interest  you mentioned inspiration we talked about interest yeah  where you get inspiration from you have do you have like like blogs magazines are like you just go outside yeah I know I have a bunch of random blogs I got a like blood sweat vector or not caught a try to go to places that other people don't go I don't look I try not to look in trouble because I think because there's so much good well the problem is okay drivel I feel like really bad about myself is amazing because I was like I stock like I said I'm old actually get out of the business these kids like eighteen years old like I just put this is redesigned all of you to be in an hour and like all your you should have my job here awesome %HESITATION I will I I have a lot like I like to look back like a lot of these old that the graph books from the eighteen hundreds like  I don't know I just try to go different places and look for look in outside of our outside is I mean you know you can get like monocle on there's all these cool different design magazines you can got there are cool but then I think what happens you just end up regurgitating we all we get we all can up copy each other and then I can exceed know everyone has this like skew more fake everything looks like leather and has stitching with fabric on top of it and it's like all right find like we're done like we'll do they get that out of your system we got to move on man %HESITATION I don't know the next thing is in like you I like I don't know if it's flat and sharp corners I don't I don't really know to be interesting to see what happens with action was actually an expression like yeah what is Z. and  translate I see a lot of transit photography you know people are doing these big large cover photos the blurry bad the blurry photo thing that that path kind of started you know give a lot of credit to those guys for like even the cover photo type thing and then it's it's funny because when when Facebook or Google or any of us when when we do things in design and they tend to push some trends so Facebook went to these big cover photos %HESITATION you know we have those on Google plus now the big cover photos %HESITATION I mean you to use with doing branding for a long time ID voicemail do big background behind so like YouTube and Twitter you can do big background behind our channel to kind of give you some some branding I so I don't know it'll be interesting to see what the next kind of evolution of things I think will be I think we're going to everyone's going very minimalist like windows eight is cow that metro style I see a lot of that kind of emerging %HESITATION you know we were talking a medium a little bit before the interview that's like large topography big foot big photos simple  everything's ready touch friendly I think people are stuck in no I think you were realizing you can't rely on hover anymore you have to really kind of think mobile first MA one million people sell time think mobile first but what does that really mean thing that really needs cleaning all the crap out of your app in just going with the most you distill it down to what you really need so I love I love you know I love big beautiful topography I love photos I I love good content it's funny like people try to take good design in and have that be a substitute for good contact but we have beautiful pictures and in great writing like how much designed  really need on the anyway diverging a little bit of a god  %HESITATION well my last question would be like you have any  tips to people that's not a usability lab like yeah I have all these things here the amazing %HESITATION I guess for start ups of people just want to test their new ideas %HESITATION there like ways to do that very cheaply  also like quality feedback yeah you know last night we you know we had we had that event %HESITATION cool we had an event that %HESITATION Boston's Irish together and Jake nap talk last night he had some great tips it was using users them do very quick usability studies one of the examples he shared %HESITATION that I thought was fantastic was he set up a thing where he would show your site each a one mock for five seconds ten seconds then would go away they need ask user the users and what does that website do another was awesome like I never thought even do that and I think of your start up I mean  I think you take Iraq in you just show it to people knowing someone this he put in from what what do you think this does and %HESITATION so yeah that's a great thing you can do I think the second thing you can do is is use your app you can get even here you see we get to I don't know that I used the particular things I work on for you too every single day I think if I did I'd start to see a lot more problems and fixes I tend to rely on our user studies outside world so I would say you know use that app as much as you can %HESITATION in in a start up typically you have like the founder using it all the time but maybe not the whole team  so that's really  %HESITATION other things that are interesting for me is  five I don't think you I like dribbles interesting because you put something up there to get all sorts of opinions I think you need one or two close friends that can give you like some unbiased feedback they're not they're not me like %HESITATION that's so cool you're awesome no I tell me how terrible the person I am and how terrible this design is in tell me you don't understand it don't try to act like you get it understand so you know good friends like you guys interviewed Erin yeah like I would show some to Erin any day there and be like that's terrible war that's amazing and he would be able to tell me why and and and I do would also because you have that trust with with someone like Erin %HESITATION your data birds another person I could take something to an end  he there Dave they're able to take your friendship and just compartmentalize it that that's over here let's talk design this doesn't work and these are the reasons why %HESITATION and I don't know I think the other the other itching to steal another thing from Jake's talk %HESITATION in worse we do this here you to two people use keynote to do said you %HESITATION interactive mocks there's also I've use proto proto dot I. L. which I think is an awesome site you can upload a bunch of %HESITATION assets not mocked assets and then just like in Photoshop you keep him on a layer and you sign in different actions and then you can then you can basically it'll build a little mini out for you in your phone then you can take around you can swipe and do all that kind of thing so there's and there's a whole bunch of other tools coming out for mock building whatever that I think are awesome you know and I I would use all those things and get him in the  friends hands and just use the crap out of it if you got and then you're my wife  bless her heart she she arm she's not terribly tactical but **** but you know she's always a good a good test for me %HESITATION just because she's she's a mom she's in a hurry and so %HESITATION she super smart but she doesn't want to deal with things so it's good to show her things and if she doesn't understand interface frustrate service like what this with my time I don't use it so that's my Pinterest worked so well for her it's you know there's an extension she's on a site she loves you hit the thing is done and there's not there's a lot to that my daughter is fascinating she gave her an I phone and and there's this trend where she doesn't tax our friends to take a video of herself into like Hey how's it going dad us Merrin and hope you're doing good send  and then she and I'm like and I answer that why are you doing this thing that text typing is stupid takes way too much time like what I even want to do that that's a that's a waste of time I can hit a button and talk and send it in so turn off her friends are just videos back and forth it's it's crazy it's interesting so  you with the information age were super impatient they want things right now we're tired of working and we just want to we just want things really fast and so I I you know we've compress the time line to do a start up you get a designer again engineer together you can make it and the P. really fast but that's all getting compressible press compressed so I think I don't know man I think you share your thing with somebody and they're like oh that's cool you sock you fail okay that's not good enough I ask what is this  you know you have to be honest with yourself to kind of  Arafat that feedback cool my humble opinion I don't know it's like we have a lake sorry so much if they great it was great slowly thanks for having us yeah I know anytime was great up yes and  I say by and see you next that
