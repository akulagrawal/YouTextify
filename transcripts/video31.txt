Hey folks once again welcome back to the really is podcast I'm Zach Naylor co founder and CEO here to really S. as well as your host for the show our guests this time around is Michelle fits Patrick a senior product manager at inter com the very popular and growing customer messaging platform for apps and websites  Michelle and I had a chat about her time over the course of many years intercom going from a smaller team to very fast growing company and how to still make sense of your products and customers all along the way  she has a passion for applying an understanding of customers to her work as a product manager to make the best decisions prosper audible something I share passion for personally and she had a lot to share on how she and the inter county in does just that  shell even shared a few stories of how user research save the day from building the wrong thing as well as how they use customer research and feedback to make design product decisions in a calm  from a shell user research and creating a closer constant contact with intercoms customers and even the product help her build this sense of gut feeling or intuition that she really attributes to intercoms products access  she gave many tactical and practical examples of how to do this yourself in some stories and how she did so herself at inter com  it's a common theme here on the really is podcast that we hear so many never really guests talk about user research in building that intuition for your customers and how that is the most common factor for making successful products designs and features it's no surprise then that we built our own product really is to help you do just that really is is a user research and insights tool for designers researchers and product leaders to help you organize all your research and insights in one place  makes sense what you learned and share them with your team in order to make awesome design product feature decisions you can check it out for a fourteen day free trial over at our website a really a slab dot com that's W. W. W. dot A. U. R. E. L. I. U. S. L. A. B. dot com  okay let's get on with the show and our special guest Machel fits Patrick  welcome to really is podcast episode twenty five with Michelle fits Patrick she is a senior product manager at intercom Michelle walking the show  thanks for having me back absolutely so for those of us who may not know about intercom for those of us foolishly not using it %HESITATION com is a product right now maybe give us a little bit of background of inner calm in the work that you're doing there  sure %HESITATION so intercom is our communications platform for businesses to talk with their customers %HESITATION it started off primarily as a way to talk with the people that are %HESITATION signed up and logged into your products add to tell them about new features to get feedback from them or offer support I believe expanded I further %HESITATION and that works on and I put on your marketing website you can talk with visitors and help try and engage them and get them to sign up for help sell to them as well %HESITATION and we can use it at all stages of your communication lifecycle with your customers nice Wilson your senior product manager there tells a little bit about the role you play and write some of this  %HESITATION so as a product manager intercom I've been here a little over four years %HESITATION and the role has mostly stayed the same and last time with what a product manager is responsible for an intercom I'm the way we work is we have %HESITATION product team set up that owned a part of the product and within the team we have a product manager a designer and engineering manager and %HESITATION maybe three to eight engineers and everybody on that team is responsible in different ways for solving customer problems as the primary role of the product manager is to define the problems that are as valuable for us to solve and then really old and at what the problem is and carry that threat old faces from when we figure out what problems we should be solving all the way through designing solutions building them releasing them getting feedback and all the research we do in between %HESITATION the product managers role is to really keep that at the point of the problem we're trying to solve and front and center the whole way through  that's yeah that's a gets a really really great concise description too and I have one of the more clear ones I think of product management right yeah we we hear a lot of people talking about what product management is just as we do what is you acts and what is the role between those two right effort yeah for sure add added to come we as  we came up with this at Megan's been a number of years ago around basically who's accountable for what in the process going all the way from Hey here's an idea we should do until all customers are using it %HESITATION and even though there's a lot of overlap primarily the product manager owns the problem the designer owns the solution and the engineers %HESITATION in the execution of that %HESITATION that in reality there's huge overlap between each of those but it gives us like a little bit of light clarity of at of kind of the pine trees between each role I have but inevitably lead we have engineers are having conversations around are we really solving the right problem or thought the problem should be solving with product managers poking and add details of design with designers and all parts of the process so this huge huge overlap between our roles throughout the process %HESITATION the way we work here is everybody is sitting co located at sitting in a as same like bank of tasks we do  signed up together planning together so the team really works as a unit so that encourages all black collaboration between the different roles %HESITATION but the the concept of the PM owning the problem is is pretty clear and I think that's that's kind of the easiest way to define what a product manager is primarily responsible for of course and there's lots of other things that we end up doing is all  okay awesome so though the one thing you said there too that is really the central theme around product management for for you an intercom is that the product manager owns the problem  can you just can you talk about that a little bit more maybe even in the context of  how you figure out the right problems are problems that are worth solving because you mentioned that too and I think that that's an extremely important point all right %HESITATION  okay so that's that is definitely a tricky one I think there's no %HESITATION  solid framework for for quantifiable Lee measuring which problems are more valuable than others I think there's always at a bit of judgment required from a PM  I am in terms of the problem  problem definition I think is the restroom we we have a four member we have that a single document it as short document like one to two pages at for every project that the PM is responsible for a filling item that that document %HESITATION includes the problem definitions that's pretty so thank the kind of aim to be like in two hundred fifty words describe what the problem we want to solve is I will fight alluding to any solution  which can be tricky %HESITATION and then we also includes a part arraigned how we would measure if we've solved this problem again without really being specific around the solutions are not necessarily going into specific metrics just yet but how would we know %HESITATION if we solve this problem and that's usually the first as phase of the project is to articulate it I in this document and for me I find at that forcing function of trying to be really says saying %HESITATION and describe what can be like an unwieldy entangled problem in like two hundred fifty words is a really really great exercise at being articulate and knowing what the value of the problem really is and how to actually pinpoint and what it is and really concise description at with by trying to sell it to people or whatever else you might be trying to to do to get your project off the ground I'm set since it's that yeah it's a really succinct way of doing as great forcing function and I find %HESITATION for myself once I write those I'd add they merely serve the job for me I tend to not even look at them again by it by that stage I have a lot of clarity on what the problem is and that that carries me through the project as I'm interacting with all the different people that were working with on it sure well so this is interesting in and just to to kind of summarize that for everybody listening if there's %HESITATION there's this document that you put together an intercom that is simply as possible I think you said two hundred fifty words give or take a couple times have to articulate what the problem is I have many questions coming out of that but I think perhaps the first an obvious one is well where does that come from where does that understanding of that problem so that you can properly articulate it come from  excellent question %HESITATION so we we've got to stage four we've got a pretty good process for %HESITATION  creating in reviewing road maps for that teams I'm but that is as our process there has gotten a lot better more consistent the  the crafting of the road map %HESITATION I guess is less well defined in this probably done slightly differently by each P. M. at into common depending on what product area they're working on her fourth the focuses I am usually there is a very close relationship with our research team to come it's quite small but %HESITATION we were kindly with them and we have a lot of different inputs into this roadmap  and the there's probably a couple things like one is identifying the kind of the set of problems that we think Adam are most worth solving  and then it's figuring I as what is the order of which we should start at tackling these problems and then as we kind of figured that if I was working three each one to actually start digging in my articulating what that problem specifically is  in terms of %HESITATION identifying all the problems with solving that's where we kind of look at all the different inputs that we have for a road map so  and we lean heavily on our customer support team is one where we have all of our %HESITATION most common feature requests or areas of confusion in the products they are all the things that our current customers are asking is for %HESITATION we also as has a good relationship with people and our sales team that are talking to prospective customers and we understand what things that they're looking for maybe things that they are looking for their product doesn't yet offered  we also look at M. and talk with we try our best to talk with a can be tricky to talk with a customer is that AT shirt and leave our product to find a what was it that didn't meet their needs %HESITATION and then we periodically will do larger pieces of research %HESITATION with like one much longer in depth interviews with kind of the target customers for a different product areas add to really kind of understand their needs %HESITATION what were they what are they trying to get the product to do a probe really Hadley on on identifying those jobs ad that they have for the product  so with all of those inputs were gonna get this list of %HESITATION of problems that we could tackle and and then we try and figure I will which are the ones that are worth tackling a which are the most valuable ones and for that there's probably a bit of  back and forth between the PM having just a good sense and what brings you here the most when you hear them what as which of those things customers have like the strongest feelings about it yeah that's something that you would like to have the speech your verses like all my god if I have to and came to this thing one more day and I can get this thing done as I'm just going to quit this product Evans like you you try and understand like the the magnitude of these problems %HESITATION and then the other as strong input is ranger company strategy of I'm not just for the part of the product that I am the thinking of high that's feeding into all the other parts of the products that are being worked on what are all the other %HESITATION product managers looking at doing so that as a whole at inter common things gets get shipped to release friend to come and make sense when they're bringing the product in the direction we want as opposed to having  a bunch of PM's building things and carrying off in different directions based on what they each thinks so it's really important that we have %HESITATION of a coherent strategy that is helping us make these decisions are and what is important what are we trying to achieve with the products this quarter this year %HESITATION and use that as a basis to help make a privatization decisions sure  that sounds like a lot of work  I am  stating the obvious  it is I cast like the reality is that most of that stuff is done and will not necessarily in like specific blocks of time it happens constantly and conversations with people all the stuff is I am just being absorbed by the PM so just  talking to lots of people within the company talk with customers very frequently reading lots of customer conversations every day %HESITATION all of that just see you soak up this information and you build this kind of got science of as things that you start feeling are important sure sure  yes so we tend to do more like that and less like a we need to spend this week looking at Turner let's this week let's look at %HESITATION feature requests or something yeah  well everything you describe their Michelle sounds to me like research  right we we might not traditionally call at that rate but when you're talking about your customer support team and you're talking about you know some of the reasons why people leave and and this is all this is all research user research to me a hundred percent yeah it is I am yeah because I think some is able to give you the research much more around like conducting an interview with people %HESITATION and we do that as well am and I love doing that I think it's that it's after one of my favorite things especially a lovely loose unstructured interview and just got someone on a call or meeting in person and and just talk through understand their world what else is going on in their world turns that into com is not the center of their universe either in their lives or oftentimes in their job %HESITATION I'm really getting a good understanding of of what part intercom plays in their in their work life what are they using it for what are they trying to do one of the other things are trying to date just %HESITATION I think building back context is is hugely valuable to build that empathy as for customers and and help understand why they even log in and using this product to begin with %HESITATION  that helps us make as so many decisions especially the in person ones I find those winds and  they're much more memorable they can carry you through  so many decisions %HESITATION but aside from that the other types of research I guess that we do is very very customer centric %HESITATION it's much more exact than %HESITATION like competitors or where I industry trends as thought inform some things and we obviously are always admiring that like any business  buy them but is very much around our current center potential customers I what are their needs %HESITATION and that's the main thing that we focus on sure  well and you mentioned a number of %HESITATION as you put it inputs to that road map %HESITATION and I suspect those inputs are all those places that we might consider research I'm very curious %HESITATION because because of my bias in what we do here to really is but I'm curious how do you manage all of those inputs you know how do you how do you start making decisions or or figure out what you learned from all these different places of customer important and what we might consider research insights  so we don't and we don't really have a lot of fast structured touring for this stuff and it over the years I've gone from being extremely diligent divided in trying to measure everything and then other times I'll be a little bit Lieser I'm winning I used to do a lot of was at times I I recorded download all of the feature quest my product area code them and I keep track of what things were increasing and decreasing and I have really granular coding %HESITATION and then after a while it's doing that I realized I had just  build up the kind of innate sense of of what we're all the things people are asking about it and what was more important than another Alaska by the the bean counting up only got nine request for it this week and the seventeen for this other thing and you kind of just build up this more natural sense of what feels important and it's on a fairly the number of requests but again kind of like high  like how important is it in a more people are trying to do is it like just a nice to have for an essential thing I'm since being Kantian stuff doesn't add doesn't really get that across  but I used to be really really deliberative I thought I had a spreadsheet that was maybe like couple five seven pieces of feedback all coded really nice pivot tables at and then I just kind of stopped doing once I realized I had internalized so much but I'm of course that's not an easy thing to share always with other people but I am but it became like a at an unnecessary task I think that I may just I one thing I do is I it's set up like a  and daily email to myself the pulled at some customer feedback and just sent it to me every morning and I just scanned that one is on the way into work five minutes and it's going to read through it you just kind of keep that finger on the pulse of things that are coming up everything we see something it's kind of like yeah I've seen that before yep %HESITATION that's new that's interesting let's dig into that and and that's really important for a PM just black staying really connected to your customers and your product just to understand is anything changing here %HESITATION or are we starting to see a shift %HESITATION or after we really something have we seen those request good dynamic something else is coming up %HESITATION so that's always a really really important thing at de yeah  okay end up if one of things it's been sitting in the back of my mind I've been burning to ask since you even started talking about product management noting the problem and sort of this process  you know an intercom in for you where is designed to sit in all of this %HESITATION you axe design right  many would argue sorry demeanor is meant many would argue that you X. design owns the problem right now I'm sure you've come across this argument for an up you be maybe they even had had that argument with some folks and you in the past  eight it as it's seven like a very close partnership I think and as we start getting to the phase of defining the problem that's when there's a lot of as a conversation between the PM and designer I would designer is thinking right the problem think about solving it %HESITATION and that's when they all go like a lot of push back on weight is is this like is this the part of the problem we want to solve like how big is this problem like high fired we wanna okay deep do we want to go on this %HESITATION because every problem we encountered it's never like neatly isolated it's always connected to another when connected to another one it just something else that we want to improve or change as a one part of %HESITATION PM's well is really  thanks coping the problem of having those binders of like okay this is as far as we want to talk on this problem otherwise we'll we'll never get to at a solution or decision or will basically have be trying to redesign the entire product was link %HESITATION so that's that's one part but then there's this kinda nice healthy tension of pushing back and forth as we start looking at solutions as come up with ideas  I figure I like it then you star probing is this really the problem maybe it's something else maybe we should or can we be tackling this problem in a very different way what are all the different ways we can tackle it and but there is a lot of that a lot of collaboration between then  I am the designer and oftentimes the designer will maybe take the problem definition and expand on it a lot further so go from kind of the very succinct version %HESITATION and really break it apart and and add more color to it for the in as part of their process as well so surveys are definitely collaboration and and a little healthy tension sure in that healthy tension again just if I'm hearing you in keep me honest is really in the way of a designer maybe taking that problem definition in sort of stretching the boundaries of order testing the boundaries of it  yeah because I like the other thing is a PM that you're bouncing is and  thanks timelines for projects in a way %HESITATION so we don't have the luxury of taking a problem and spending like months exploring solutions and and researching it intact this greatest that would be in as much as I'm sure we all love to really do that as we also kinda have a commitment with the engineers on our team that we're kind of planning that we're gonna spend maybe this much time on design so we're gonna be looking to start building this and  yes three weeks or four weeks so there's a there's a certain time boxing of like how much time do we want to spend exploring this problem more looking to solve it and and that's a nice where the role the PM comes in as well to to set those by injuries and give that focus and direction as so design can really folks and get to %HESITATION really promising about able solution within a time frame and so that engineers can get involved at the right time because we really have to partner with them as well yeah that makes sense and actually that that makes me think of another question because  so we had a couple episodes of our our different track of the podcast you're called inside it really is it's just chose a phone I kind of talking about you know things are important us we're doing at the company and we've been very passionate recently about this idea of %HESITATION engineers and technologists being part of research I'm curious you know how do they  how to how do you work with engineers and and and helping them understand the problem in understanding the the customer needs from that research inner calm are there other things you can share about that  sure arms I think one of the things that we do that I've noticed as very strand comes we hire very %HESITATION hire engineers that how are curious and interested in product and interested in  how people are going to use what they're building and so as part of the interview process there interviewed by a product manager %HESITATION such part of every engineering and interview them to come  so as a result of that the engineers I've worked with %HESITATION across my time here all been incredibly curious about the problem we're solving a better %HESITATION customers and also really curious about it %HESITATION when we release something to customers heights being use water they say %HESITATION it is working as a good like they're really really curious and eager to insure them what they're building actually has value in this purpose to it and it's not just a range of writing echoed or building something they think is cool and having it right there nobody using it off very satisfying I'm so that's one part as then we also include them in all phases of the  where most phases I think of the whole process from him up to design so I'll run walk through the roadmap  with the engineers and they'll have lots of questions and ideas %HESITATION will do user testing and engineers will sit in on it %HESITATION we're doing some user testing some concept testing %HESITATION tomorrow and Friday it's something I'm my team of the researcher shared the shape of the list of interviews the time slots and engineers will be sitting in on some of those just to really understand %HESITATION  the our customers better and what they're looking for and and then I think of the other parts at all in terms of then %HESITATION design and that's another huge aware as we start getting close to figuring out the solution that we're going to build  then we start partnering very closely with engineering  the men balls and it for like  these ability for their height ask for estimating this because I'm usually the designers in the PM have a good sense of like what is a what solution would involves like a huge minds of engineering efforts persons like something more straightforward %HESITATION but will partner very closely with the engineers and they'll work on kind of initial  explorations and some of the new ideas as really early before we've kind of been settled on the final and design so they'll they'll input at into Latin they'll they'll explain some trade offs that we should be making so there's a good a good partnership %HESITATION last season the process too nice so there really involved kind of threw out but you know the thing there I I believe it's a little bit harder to take down is that you say intercom looks for curious engineers they look for people who are  interested in understanding how people are using it and and why it matters to them right a hundred percent yeah and I interview engineers all the time in here %HESITATION with injuries every week a few different addicts every week so and all the product managers and so the product designers are involved in those interviews as well yeah  alright let's zoom back out a little bit and talk about how all this research makes a good decision  I know that that's something that you're passionate about and %HESITATION and I would say %HESITATION  it least in my opinion as being a customers of inner calm and I think many others would agree %HESITATION so far you're doing a pretty good job with that so let's how does that happen how does research inform what a good decision is product for Iran  we definitely we don't have fun  I guess that process for high we do research on every project %HESITATION problem it it may very so much %HESITATION in terms of ambiguity of the problem with the complexity of it or %HESITATION or high much kind of conviction we have fun what we want to builder or what the idea is I'm so it's actually quite interesting for some things we've done and we definitely kind of  god on both ends of the spectrum on it we've dined at someone's far too much research on very small projects and we really kind of gone into the details in ways that looking back we're probably a bit unnecessary we could've been in it scrap here and then other times we've done some big projects with relatively little as a user researcher user interviews %HESITATION and that's been also quite interesting  and so some of the things that I find over my time is really to only to to think about how you're gonna spend your research time %HESITATION we don't have we don't have a few researchers dedicated researchers in income like lots of times that PM's will do some research themselves  but the decision and to use research I think it's it's really only valid if you read there are generally have something that you need to learn that you can't flared with by doing at was I doing interviews are doing deep research or if you're like willing to change course based on the findings of that research %HESITATION I think a lot of times looking back we probably done research at a rate very low level details and really to get confirmation of our decisions which is kind of it's a little bit lazy in a way and it's it's quite expensive way to do it  I had to kind of make decisions %HESITATION where is usually you can just make a decision and and go with it you don't need to you test up so everything especially if you're just hoping at the research will come back and give you a thumbs up at you're you're basically planning for that to happen that's like a a terrible way to to use research %HESITATION we definitely have projects in the past where  we've done research and then come back on their decision and change talked a few times and that's always a hard one to do at PM especially if your %HESITATION if you're pushing for something and you're really invested in it to actually kind of  all the billing okay I think maybe this is not the right direction definitely %HESITATION I'd actually love to hear a lot more about that if you have any specific example because I think that that shows great maturity in a product organization in fact yeah  thank there is what I'm  there is one last year that we definitely and that caused a lot of at  circling I guess we we have this concept and so the part of the product I was working on at the time was the inbox an intercom so that this is the place for teams work together to see the conversations that are coming in from the messenger %HESITATION and respond to those  no one of the %HESITATION problems were looking at tackling was how to better prioritize %HESITATION conversations with in the inbox and %HESITATION privatize the customer is your you are responding to you and we look to lots of different solutions of one of them that we came up with which we thought was just SO clever and was this idea of these like dynamic were smart in boxes and they would be like a view of your inbox based on some filters about who the people were %HESITATION or what the conversations where she could say show me all the open conversations with my V. I. P.'s based in a better in French or something %HESITATION so we had to come up with this concept of this really flexible and box system  when we tested it was customary is and they did not get it addled they thought it was really confusing and they it totally over search their needs and most of people we talked with did not need this superselect dynamic at in boxes that she just needed a better way to see the list of ones they already had and they had much simpler more basic needs and we were thinking more like but we have all this data arraigned at who your customers are like who the people writing into our what the conversations by it we could build something that would create the smart views based on those and add people actually find it really confusing and we got to a point where we were like well we we just keep going maybe they don't realize this great New World so we're trying to build for them and we realize we actually have to pull back and the dress kind of the more simpler problems as that we had in the inbox that needed addressing before we started adding more complexity to it and and that  remember that project was tricky because  we had kind their faith thank bank online yeah we'll get some learnings but we'll keep progressing here  and and that meant that basically engineers were  getting ready that in a few weeks they'd be starting to build less and the I was on a road map we were communicating to the teams that this is the price next project we're taking on and this is the direction I was going and I course when you as change course on that there's lots of other people impacted stands near thing to figure I'd or we need to figure out with them okay if it's not this what is it that we're going to work on at least tell other teams that that's not happening we're doing something else %HESITATION so it's not as it is there's more like visibility of the change like of the river %HESITATION changing direction than just kind of within research at because it's so connected to all the other teams and people in the company %HESITATION so that was probably one and then if there's like us a slight frantic like okay that's not this that we're building what are we doing a reading something with that %HESITATION we do nothing with it %HESITATION and that's tough because about point you needs like that product in design side need time to M. digested and think about what we should be doing instead  yes well so how is that received I mean I don't think that that as you describe it I have to believe that other people have had at least I hope a similar  situation occur to them in in this case though  I am a little bit biased and home saying this but research save the date it save it solid you from not building the wrong thing a hundred percent owners is definitely the the right call at yes is something I I think just in the way that our product teams work if it doesn't happen that often but it's not and it's not a negative for seen as a negative I definitely requires like okay we need to change plan and we need to figure out how can we change plans quickly what you would be doing instead at but it's not and is never seen like a as a failure it is always like a a positive and always the sooner you can learn that before you invest more time into something by far the the better at so I think everybody else ought also sees sees back benefit  well yeah that's that's that's awesome and it's it's nice to hear that story because I think a lot of people who are who are designers are researchers arm  probably love to hear that to say Hey the work we do save the day it can and Hey look at this year's this example and write it you know in where it did there something else that you kind of talked in about their %HESITATION I do not expect to talk about but it's interesting because I have personal experiences as well which is all of a sudden we pull the rug out under ourselves because we say  Hey this is not the right thing to build based on the research we did move %HESITATION the thing that's interesting there is that you said okay one hour of a sudden everybody scrambling to say well what should engineers be working on  I'm actually just very curious like why does this culture exist because it's everywhere it's but it's a pretty much every company I've been at where all the sudden we have this this %HESITATION anxiety that we have to keep technology in engineering busy all the time we have to have we have to be feeding them work all the time yeah  M. great question this is a may have been thinking about that a lot I I I I find it so that it is a real challenge like the the sequence of work between I figure at the road map figure out what problem does all working on the design and then getting ready to build a means a little bit water folly anyway but that's kind of the sequence of things I am each of those phases  aren't always proportional to each other so makes planning and people's time quite tricky sometimes things will take like five weeks to design and think about it and then it turns out that the solution that we got to is only going to take two weeks to build and then you're like okay  right we've got like one designer to four engineers here and all of a sudden we've spent our time like disproportionately on one of the other than these other projects that will add design in a couple weeks it will take many many weeks to build MC are constantly have this and this balance because we operate as like one team and everybody works together %HESITATION between the engineers and designers it's not %HESITATION we don't have like a separate bank of engineers to a team of designers and they just Haas work over when it's ready and and the engineers take the next available thing I am so there is that that partnership and and that the runway as I call it between design and and engineering how much of a room we we build up sometimes like it's eaten up really quickly at other times it grows longer you're you're trying to keep  at just the right amount of gap between a design and engineering so design has enough space to explore but they need to and every visit things that they need to they don't feel that engineers are fighting on the heels but also that they're not too far ahead so that engineers are involved in that process a bit I am but it's that's definitely at at tricky one to manage I mean they can always we always have via our lovely tech death backlog and issues that can be done and things that can be everywhere slide %HESITATION engineers also want to work %HESITATION but again because we hire quick weight product focused engineer is as there's always a lot of satisfaction out of  now building something valuable sometimes that is tact that's nuns it's fixing issues %HESITATION and sometimes it's building some some new functionality to solve a problem yeah that makes a lot of sense and I like the way that you worded it in this in terms of this building run where this space between art design and engineering is  yeah you're right I mean the the balance there is difficult because you want and as you say you do it in a calm you want those folks who were in technology actually part of forming the the the the definition of the problem to then act on a solution %HESITATION but maybe not so close as to where it's constricting of being able to explore that problem space right right and that's again that's another healthy tension to help like  you know if a little bit of pressure can also be good to force decisions and so  there is that at a good element of that in terms of we we don't have the luxury of unlimited time as so kind of having having that is that as of voicing and function on a kind of when we need to get something at least something done buyer ready buyer or ready to even start building and exploring and testing and that's kind of it that's a good as a good deadline for PM's and designers to have a mind nice  nice  you know I I I see that were we're coming up on the end of our time and I am quite sure that we could discuss these things for three times as long as we have but unfortunately we don't see and I wanna be respectful that for you in all areas I'm curious if there is %HESITATION I started asking this is the end of all of our podcast if there's something let's say I had temporary amnesia and I forgot everything that we talked about you know what what would you say is maybe the most important point  that we cover today that people listening should really remember  great question and I think it is that as staying close to the people that are using your product and single sack your actual product itself a is just invaluable in helping you build at a good sense of what you should be doing as a product manager and I I think it's it can be very easy to get the tax from that dust with the nature of all the things that are going on in your company in your industry all the time and and not spend enough time in that but %HESITATION the closer you stay to customers and and internalize and what it is their needs are at that just helps you make really quick decisions from having a good sense of what you should be doing in on that applying at your road map all the way down to like low level trade offs that you might get in the middle of a project you know should we do acts or wire or should we watch the defaults be air I'm understanding those needs and deeply understanding the makes you just have that really instant got sense of what the decision should be  awesome okay  all right very good %HESITATION is there anything that you'd like to share with folks listening today that we maybe didn't talk about a cover in the show  well I think that we have at this time of and  great information and insights and thoughts on our end to come blog which you're probably familiar with so inside intercom it's blog dot intercom dot com ad that's really the best source to go and if you're curious about any of the stuff we write a by product management and research and how we build our company and our product all the time I'm aware expanding but I am constantly so there is a curious there's tons more information they're awesome we'll make sure we have a link to that in the show notes and then you know on that note I guess is there %HESITATION is their best place to reach you of other folks maybe wanna wanna reach out have specific questions %HESITATION follow up with something you discussed yes Sir are you can grab me on Twitter Chile fitz I'll give you that spelling words you can just paying into it to come into our messenger and ask for me and somebody will pass the conversation over to me and they'll they'll call you over the intercom at inter com I really I really hope that there's at least a real live intercom somewhere in your offices  there is  I don't know I don't know we have a proper into combo which we should get one I think that that's absolutely necessary at least in one office that you have  just to talk to the other offices to be good one yeah oh yeah absolutely that that's a perfect idea  okay
