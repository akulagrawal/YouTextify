lower on the page it's been around since the two thousand one gas on the page has been around since two thousand one %HESITATION it I have a a writer studio in Los Angeles where I teach live classes and I teach them on first draft rewrite page TV %HESITATION some story analysis you know just whatever I think that our writer needs %HESITATION in the moment and also have a podcast calls on the page %HESITATION we've been doing it for I don't know seven or eight years weekly podcast with writers and producers anybody who can talk script  how did you get into doing this how do I get into doing this %HESITATION was kind of a a sideways move a friend had asked me to read a script for her %HESITATION for a company she was working at I found out you can get paid for doing that huh and I ended up sending my samples %HESITATION to Amblin entertainment at the time which was %HESITATION Steven Spielberg's company and I got hired as a reader and I kind of learned on the job %HESITATION reading not only for Amblin but also DreamWorks and they became DreamWorks and a number of other companies and then I ended up teaching based on what I was learning from reading scripts as and seeing how people were responding to them what was working what wasn't working I try to translate those into tools and those classes became popular became a book stuff like that  we're here at story expo two thousand fifteen we're getting you in between classes and so forgive me if I'm a little rushed here I just wanted to find you or %HESITATION take on this right now I'm reading %HESITATION Joyce Carol Oates book the faith of a writer which is %HESITATION sort of about her life and she talks about %HESITATION the  writer sort of isolation and some of the things that are a little bit darker that some of these books don't always cover one thing she says is the artist is born damned and struggles through his or her life to achieve an ever elusive redemption by way of their art wow wow I thought is lighter than we are that the artist is born damned is very interesting to me because I think that some people can feel that they've been damaged by creativity that there is this need to express something and they're sort of in a personal jail until they can get it out and I think that that might be what she's going for there is to talk about this fact that it's not that an artist  create because they want to make money they create because they have to and %HESITATION and and as far as that personal redemption I think it's more that idea of sort of a a personal release but I think she certainly on to something everybody's a little damned and they're better people for it  first thing like that should a screenwriter have a plan be shot a screenwriter have a plan be high I guess look on a practical level I guess every artist should have a way that they can make money but not as the the that that plan that says well I'm gonna give up eventually and then I should do this I think there it's fine to have a job that you love that supports the art that you love and I think what you'll find two is that they often go hand in hand you know you can bring your writing to a day job and you can bring the experiences from your life and day job and family into your writing so it it these things don't have to compete  what makes a good story for me I'm always saying it's action plus a motion %HESITATION because the kind of story telling that I teach a scripted store storytelling so we have to see it and we have to feel it action be get some motion which begets more action so to me it's the marriage of these two things  what do you see writer struggling the most when they come into your classes what is some of the things they share with you when they struggle the most is probably this need to to follow rules and get it right and there are no real rules and there is no one way to get it right so I'm always trying to get them just to express their intention for the story in pages as best they can if they've met that intention that's right you know those are their roles so I I think that's that's that's where I see you artist struggling as you know it's it's got to be perfect no it doesn't it just has to be what you want  interesting now that  what can a screenwriter due to get better at their craft is that is that basically it to just kind of express that underlying motion without trying to be so perfect in explaining a certain store that if they were a little more free with it yeah yeah I do think that there are  no on the other hand %HESITATION certain %HESITATION tools and techniques that they can use for  for %HESITATION tearing down their work for focusing their work for making sure that their meeting their intentions by picking the words that best expressed that by placing the words where they need to buy really focusing their scenes so that their scenes tell  story %HESITATION so it's not a question of %HESITATION just be free okay it is a question of really looking at your art and making sure that you are telling the story as best you can  with those intentions and mine %HESITATION  I've say don't meet make it perfect because it doesn't have to be but you do have to spend some time focusing doesn't make sense it does it does is there a point that a writer should give up on a screen play is there a point that a writer should give up on a screen play  I you know no I don't think so because I think you've all heard the stories of I and then I put in and shore and then six years later somebody wanted this or a world event happened and it was just right so you might put it aside for the moment because it's not getting the traction you want it's it's it's for you yourself have tired of it and you want to move on to something else go ahead put it in the drawer but don't get rid of that that is a piece of art that will find its way eventually  do you believe a screen writer should write their first draft as quickly as possible just kind of burger to take it out of themselves and then  revise from there not you're talking about the vomit draft our two  we have such nice expressions for it I yes I do %HESITATION and why I urge my students not to look back that's where the perfection starts to come in and they stop of the writing process and they have these beautiful for first acts and then they never go any further so yes by all means right to the end  and then you can go back in and you can start honing it and chiseling away at it or fattening it up make it better but right to the end so they plan to do a ninety page script don't don't stop in the middle and make sure that it's okay they've got to just get it all out right right barrel forward I think I think so many people make the mistake of going back and re reading what they wrote the day before polishing that up and only moving this much further we don't have enough time you know we only set so much writing time in the day you've got to make as much use of that as you can press for is there a time frame for writing this for script  I think that time frame is is personal it really depends on where you fit it in your life you know %HESITATION I've made my whole philosophy of teaching is writing in ten minute increments because of being a busy person myself and knowing that my writers are busy so I do believe that what ever time you have you can make the best use of it as long as you focus  does the screen play began with the word fade in doesn't doesn't begin with the word faded into me like should you have faded or not have the bay  well does writing began with the word fade in or because someone actually begin part of it in the middle I have an idea for a crux of what I want to happen but I don't have the book ending I don't have the the finished part and have the beginning yeah I think you can jump around sure if if you have certain scenes inside of you that you see visually that are sort of the tent poles for the story by all means write those down and then write what  works up to it and what springs off of them but if you get to a certain place where you're only writing what you love you're being a little and disciplined you know at at that point you have to go all right I have to start writing the scenes that I don't know or don't love as well then start from the beginning and start moving toward those key scenes that you've already written  do you think a lot of writers are undisciplined seems like writers of any of the of all the arts it seems like writers of the most sort of discipline the most heart of themselves the most sort of reigned in policy I I don't find it there and this plan but I I do think that we all have little chip tricks that we play where we write only things that we love you know or or or that we're good at you know I've watched a lot of writers that will write scene after scene and I'm like yeah I know you can do this okay where's that scene that's really hard Frio right that so it's not a question of not being disciplined so much as you know not wanting to be taken to task for not not being wonderful  right away  for time wasting with writers aside from surfing the internet and research yeah what do you see as some of the stumbling blocks to time management %HESITATION stuff I well I think you just name to two of them you know surfing the internet and research right research is the most creative form of procrastination where somebody has no wait I have to stop I really have to look that up my  my usual advice is not right what you want and then find the research that supports that story point instead of the other way around %HESITATION but  yeah I think that that is the the the place that we all tend to convince ourselves that we're actually working and we're not we're serving  but the screen writers that you know who have sold screenplays how much of that work is better than some of those who've just put it in a drawer they finished it they've done ten drops but they're just not willing to like either take what they need to do to go on pitch it or no one's really looked at it and said this is the one well you know it you're you're heading on on both things that cell the cell one is he talked about pitching right and and there are some people I've seen who do react very well and their careers not necessarily just sell something so much as get a career off of the script that they wrote and I've seen and and that's one breed of writer that can just make connections with people you know convince them first to read the thing which is hard to do there's that kind of writer that does very well but then there's this other kind of writer that does very well because you have to pass the script a lot they have written something with such a specific voice and commitment to the characters or an idea or two a tone that it makes everybody want to pass the script along so it's those two things either being really good at sort of getting your stuff out there and getting in from the right eyes or being exceptional on the page one of those two things will get you the career that you want charisma versus crafter no it's not just Christmas the person the person who is Chris Matt craft that's the person  and I've seen a couple of those and that's a guaranteed success  the the people who do well can have just one charisma or craft it would be nice if they had they had all  best questions a screenwriter cast themselves to develop a better story right up front is what is the story what is the movie story or what is the TV story that's where the log line comes in that everybody so happy to talk about but it really is a one sentence expression of your intention if you can't get that down you might want to go back in and and and really we examine you know is there something to write here so first of all ask yourself what is that one sentence expression once you have that then you wanna ask yourself you know what what turns you on about that idea okay based on what excites you about that idea now ask what are the scenes that express that excitement you know that really really show those beats that are that you have to show on screen you know and then keep working backwards from there Kay who are the people that populate that scene what do they say so if you start big picture and then you keep sort of breaking it down to the things that excite you the people in it what they say I think I think those are the questions to ask you as you're writing  how should the screenwriter spend their time let's say for ten hours that they dedicate to their career how many of those ten hour should be developing an idea actually writing the screenplay watching movies which again could going to research  art networking reading it cetera I think we've spent our life watching and that we should continue to do so but that's not really homework it's just what we doing what we love now we don't have to feel guilty about it you know great okay terrific so you're doing that anyway %HESITATION as far as networking goes it is the the question of keeping your eyes open shaking hands making friends %HESITATION capitalizing on relationships that that's also that can also happen at the same time that this is all sort of multi platform stuff that you're doing anyway so when it comes to the real time spent for writing right now %HESITATION you can't really count any of those things as well I was writing because I was watching TV and I was making a friend  get right  is that was set to go to any calls the work to the work that scares us cyclist that that's that's sounds sounds right to me cried %HESITATION  what what is the work that you see scare most people that come into your classes that I you know I think it's it's the work the scares people it depends but often I see it in sort of the rewrite process where you have spit out that first draft where you have written the scenes that you love and then there's this you know a problem area that you have to tackle and its first about figuring out how to fix it that's that's hard but even when you know how to fix it sometimes it's not what you want to do and it's but you have to that is the place where it's hardest thing but once you get passed through at the past past bad through that %HESITATION I think that it's probably the most rewarding because you really did the hard work  he'll just focusing back on Joyce Carol Oates book the faith of a writer has a chapter on failure I think she touches briefly that a lot of artists are attracted to failure hand do you have an opinion on that I don't know I'm not really good at you know figuring out the psyche of art is %HESITATION it when you're my class you know I'm I'm always like leave the drum on the page you know I want to hear about it let's get writing you know that's sort of how how I work and I always feel like sort of the the writing pushes through the issues %HESITATION or you can take those issues and give them to a character this can be really cathartic for you %HESITATION but %HESITATION as as far as people being attracted to failure maybe one kind of writer is I don't know if all writers are I think some people are just attracted to storytelling  when it comes to selling a screen play what are some of the mistakes that you see a lot of screen writers make the mistakes would be %HESITATION desperation %HESITATION insistence you know where it's you don't know you have to read this %HESITATION it might the only story and you know the the more persistent and desperate you are the more people back off mean think of it is if you were dating you know no you have to go out with me and this is why you know that's charming right so it's when I see people do that  immediately you know they they just they just sort of ruined at %HESITATION the people that let allow the breathing room in their relationship and let the words make somebody come to them that's where they'll deals happened sales happen but again remember this is may  me about getting your career going this might be where you're hired you're not always going to sell a screenplay that screen play is going to sell you was like that's where charisma and comes back into place so how does that work and I'm sure in LA it's slightly different than in other parts of the country but how do people develop that charisma whether or not too pushy but at the same time not to make you know I I may have expressed a wrong would talk about Christmas was talking about with %HESITATION the people who make it I see like some some writers are very good about getting their stuff out in the world that still has to be a good product that they're getting out and some people are just very good at the page but they still have to be decent enough in a room that they don't scare people off it really is a mixture of both those things but the kind of Christmas we're talking about doesn't have to be like you know big bold shiny Christmas which is talking about sort of %HESITATION an authentic connection I know that with authenticity is used a lot  there's something to that you know the idea that you feel like you're talking a real person who has a story that they want to tell who you know it's it's there and it it X. the the  possibilities of it are exciting and that the writer has made those possibilities evident to the listener like this is what I'm trying to get out there isn't that interesting %HESITATION yeah it's interesting to me to %HESITATION calibrated way I heard the phrase used the other day a walking hidden agenda and I think that sometimes that's what we're trying to push our stuff out there we can come across like that we don't mean to me just a more very excited about something so I know that's a very nice  if sort term but it's actually very like a lot of people shy away from it no way because everybody does have something here they're pitching and assault hidden agenda but how can someone sort of like be excited about it but not be too aggressive in if they're working a room with some passion passion okay give it think of instead of like I am in need it's I have a passion for what you know and I think that that would that would work excellent a walking hidden agenda that sounds like a really good character description for like like a antagonize us uses a walking hidden agenda  yeah I know I heard it I just lit up like wow  developing a character we keep hearing about that there's classes on that what does this mean and how can someone develop a character whether it's someone that's a walking in and Jenna or yeah well developed character I've got a couple of tools that I use in class one of them has to do with %HESITATION developing a skill K. when you watch a character actually develop a skill whether it's a physical skill of fighting or whether it's an emotional scale of learning how to connect with somebody you're watching that character develops and you're watching it AT and experiences happening in front of us a scene is happening and event is happening we can see the development so that's one way to develop the character what skill physically or emotionally are they developing another way to develop the characters to think what are their ongoing patterns are rules that we always see them do and they do they break that rule when they break that rule where they've shied away from their patterns they're developing
