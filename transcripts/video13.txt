welcome to the myth the podcast I'm AT Simpson and this is where we took to design is a Google about life and the future of design  these episodes with J. one one of the U. X. design is working on a project fi Google's wireless data and phone service Jay and I took about the design decisions behind project by working as a designer with a computer science degree and much much more enough for me if you enjoy this episode of the method but cost  hi my name's Jay I'd seen on %HESITATION the project by team since January this year and I've been a Google for four years in total what drew you to working on project fi  I'm I was really drawn to project fi because up until that point I'd worked on JI plus and hang outs and photos and I think a lot of the objective of those apps I to kind of like keep you in the apt and stay in the app and order the interaction is kind of just like with its contained to the act itself on the project fi is like a very interesting project because it's actually more services line rather than apt design so you sort of have control we have control over the entire lifecycle like the marketing website the checkout process the activation process the packaging of the sim cards in the phones when you get them so it's it's a larger design project with more deaths and breath yeah that's just like a lot of complexity %HESITATION you're thinking about every end point and it it's much bigger than just like you X. design from an apt point of view and how is your process changed because of that I think you have a much you need to have much wider view like a high of a big of the birds eye view on like what's happening and you need to kind of like make  she always checking in on at different points because like certain things don't match like you con have complete consistency if you think about like a U. Y. way you always have the same like you I elements it's not exactly the same because there are so many different ways of interacting with this service and  I think it's in those cases because a service you need to have a much more clear idea of like for example the brand all the tone all your principles at a very high and more abstract level like we always want to be helpful witty confident  %HESITATION and I don't think that's as important when you're thinking about just like sort of an app but when you're thinking about a service with much more different kinds of design in the process it's been very helpful to have like an overarching overall feeling that you want to give these a  what is the hardest problem you think you're working on across all of that  %HESITATION there so many  %HESITATION I think that does a lot of complexity there are so many dimensions all of like states and also follow on project fight is also like lots of different uses so for example we have like a group plan %HESITATION  and it's not just like how you use this app but it's like you controlling everyone else everyone else and what they see and how you will interact with each other there like multiple flows that kind of require  like multiple handshakes basically in order to get anything done and that is really really complex because you want your Felicity like very simple and fast but ultimately there is some like necessary time stops %HESITATION you know like just to put it in perspective we have  if  I check out process that's like eleven screens in total but the set of designs for that are over eighty five different screens because it can they can be like eighty five different outcomes honest it needs to seem so easy and so simple and it does like when people use our products like we get really good customer satisfaction a lot of feedback saying it's very simple very intuitive but honestly behind the scenes it is so complex like what's happening the decisions they are making affecting the why  %HESITATION  and  sort of like  the amount of thought that's gone into hiding all of those is like  a lot of there's a lot of time that's gone into it when did you first realize you could be a designer  %HESITATION well I'm pretty sure that I have like websites and blogs from when I'm like twelve or eleven  about how I want to quit school and become a website to Lana yeah like legitimate lead they still exist online never telling anyone the Ural okay  did you have like a creative upbringing or your your parents into  liberal arts creative arts not all of them the real story is that I do remember this so clearly I was maybe like eight seven oh eight and I went to like my friend's house and she was older and she was like look this is really cool game cornea pets  now let me if that's what's bad and I want to like make all this money in my knee of head still and I like had this near that killed I wanted people to like join it and realize that  in order to do so I need might like store to stand out and it  to send out I need to like learn all this he's too Malon CSS to like make it all look good %HESITATION and then I kind of like very quickly realized that actually the part I liked most was not really like anything to do with near pets but was just like  making %HESITATION like using code to like make these beautiful things  and  I can I love this completely on my own with no like help at all  %HESITATION and in fact I remember not realizing this is like a really stupid story but  like  I will copy paste the U. R. L. like the the address of it like a local file locally into my code when I look at my computer like you'll grab an image it would look just fine %HESITATION but then I would like going to my brother's computer %HESITATION ghosts go to my friend's house and get a look at my website and then real and then I'll just get the image era %HESITATION links for everything I it took me like a lot awhile I was like you know nine or something at the time to realize that actually like there's a complete different concept twin Lake local addresses an actual  upload images on the internet yeah %HESITATION  so I kind of  found my love of web design kind of from there and coding from there and then sort of started making my own websites million blogs main template it's %HESITATION like forums and stuff and then  never looked back okay McConnell lead you into into web design and design itself  yeah I think it's funny because I started with web design first when a super young and I love technology but then I kind of as I got a bit older in high school I was then more interesting like photography and film and  graphic design I I wanted to like Saddam magazine and stuff and then %HESITATION kinda like loop all the way around I went to design school for like a year and then was like okay actually I don't find  print that compelling anymore and I kind of really miss I miss like coding  which is why I went back and then decided to like pick up a second acrylic so I basically decided take a second major %HESITATION so I was like double I did a double degree in design and computer science and yeah so I kind of did both because I just it was weird because I always knew I wanted to like make absolute make websites but like you go to computer science like you go and study computer science is very technical and it's like all out of rhythm bass and data structures which I loved but that isn't this like visceral  %HESITATION visceral feeling from like sing something visually that you create and then I felt like graphic design is so boring because it's so static and is no like fluidity or like there's like much less problem solving  I know you mean like the first time I built a website market interact with the pages and change pages I was done I was so hooked up yeah point of you like actually where is all the print design and have done when I was studying before it yet same feeling it felt very flat yeah exactly it's just like not as engaging and when you really create something in code and you see it in real life it's just like there's literally no other rush  in the world like that they creation aspect yeah %HESITATION  and like it's just not the same like making a mock  it's it's gonna gaze it's gonna be so far and it's like nice to see but it's just seeing it and interacting with something and like  being in Notting out a really difficult design problem like you X. problem is just so satisfying you integrate part is having a look into your process what benefits have you found from that  I'm I think  prototyping has like lots of different benefits I think there is many interactions especially in this day and age what is like a lot of motion and a lot of %HESITATION feeling that you're trying to get that you literally Khan capture and static images arms and sometimes I also think it can be quick a prototype than to like make fifty marks of the same thing with a different balance that makes sense using is because you have a background in coding was if you didn't have the background and cutting it would still be quicker  I mean there's always a line there's a always a toss up because of course like they're something you get for free with coding which is like  being able to change one property and change them all thus having to do that same thing and there's a couple of things in skeptic symbols that kind of help you get there but it's definitely not as fluid as it is today like with code still %HESITATION  but I mean certainly yes I think prototyping is a lot easier for me because of my background and it comes more naturally to me and that's how I think but I think even high designer who does not have that strong a coding experience like  learning to code at the very least it forces you to get better as a designer because it's forcing you to think of everything as a system  right like every time you break a system now it's a more conscious decision of like yes I think this needs to be different  instead of like I think sometimes if you just always purchased from just a visual design you're much more likely to like bend your roles all like kind of  do something that's a little inconsistent because it like looks a little better in this instance when sometimes I think like that's not practical that's not how gets built  %HESITATION  and yet it's not it's helping kind of regulate your designed to make sure it's like  working  consistently yeah I think that's a great point annex a company like Google which is engineering driven have you found that it's really help you sell your ideas to other stakeholders in your team  absolutely I honestly think that it's maybe one of the biggest like factors and biggest strengths that I've had it Google and helped me in my career I'm very close with like every engineering team I've ever worked with on the my first year at Google I was actually contributing code to the lake %HESITATION to the code base just because  it was just easier for me to like submit Polish changes then work with someone to do it I've done that less now because I've as I've gotten older I realize I don't think it's as valuable  of a valuable use of a design is time because there's just so much with %HESITATION infrastructure that just becomes a pain to like keep track of %HESITATION but having said that like a %HESITATION regularly sit down and have program with my engine is T. like Pat Polish things of mine and I think that like my understanding of  coding in my technical  %HESITATION reasoning means that like one my designs are always much mall like real like that I'm thinking about his ability as I design but to like I can kind of communicate with them to describe what I want and actually like often they'll be like oh I don't think this is possible and then I'll actually just like write them like a code snippet that they'll use %HESITATION to do it and I think that's  because it Google there's actually like for better or worse  we don't hire like front an engine is to be like front engineers we don't hire them because they're great at building for like  visual things yeah and so often like a lot of the team like they'll be kind of back in engine is a very technical engineers who have just been put on a team that happens to be implementing something %HESITATION  like scripting something and so  they might not know some of the like really cool %HESITATION CSS things that they can do on and that I can help them with  so do you feel like it am  it raises the level of trust within your team as well  yeah consistently like throughout all the different teams I've worked with like they've always I I've always gone great feedback from the from my engineer saying that it's like a great skill it's a great like di like they are much more willing to trust my design decision because they know that I've thought about like how much extra work what it is I'm asking of them is and I've decided that this is worth it  %HESITATION compared to say maybe like a designer who maybe less cynical and everything they show is a little bit more blue sky and now it's hard for them to like identify like what's what's that if that makes sense changing topic a little bit and you recently gave a talk at U. X. U. on design it tells what drove you to wanna give that took  so firstly I love to teach I like torn high school a torn %HESITATION university I a teach part time at G. A. %HESITATION  let's dig into that a little bit more like why do you love to teach  I love teaching because as like  well first I I guess I Ellie of this conversation I said that there's nothing greater in this world then like writing code in seeing it but I guess either an equal or likes very close second feeling is like working with someone and at the beginning of time with them they conte something and then seeing them be able to do something  when they walk out of the room so like even something as simple as I teach like %HESITATION nine hour like an eight hour %HESITATION introduction to coding to non engineers at Google and at the beginning of the day they lakes often don't even know how the internet works and by the end of the day like I will fully build and design like %HESITATION resume with them and they'll actually like publish it to like the web to the internet and like having your all they can show people very cool and  I guess it's in a way it's almost me trying to share that joy of creation with more people and show them that it's like it's not that hard that you can do it too if you want to  %HESITATION  so that's like one reason is I just I love teaching for that reason fundamentally but also because like I am  I'm a designer but I'm also like an engineer at Houghton lake fission see is my favorite like thing I cannot stand watching like it's really hard for me to watch another design a like work if they like being really slow and being really efficient because I just want to be like Wyalusing shock us wine you doing these things like why you wasting your time like red lining for like days when you could just do something else and I'll just do it for you like  I think that's why I told the classes because I just think that the the  the feisty or are at the tool and like the quickly you are doing things that I like boring the more time you can spend thinking about like real design problems and actually innovating  and solving like the things that the computer console Sir %HESITATION a you teach at General Assembly and I get there any other classes that you took the you've got real value from %HESITATION yeah so I teach so I teach General Assembly I teach %HESITATION do computer science summer institute which is a %HESITATION computer science program full rising like basically seniors have just graduated going into computer science from underrepresented backgrounds %HESITATION so like racial minorities and Jenna minorities and low socio economic backgrounds  %HESITATION I love teaching that because one it really means a lot to them it's really awesome to see people that age also growing learning the first time and feeling empowered and I also learned a lot from them as well about like what their allies alike and what their perspectives alike so I think it's like very much to a street  I think you know I often think to myself how lucky it was that I just by some random chance like fell into this near pets thing and how like how much of an impact it had on my life that I literally had nobody to show me that and it's just almost a coincidence like if I hadn't met that person maybe I would be doing something completely different that I wouldn't enjoy the little bit of teaching that I've done it both as your confidence a little bit when you can realize you can teacher teach somebody something and from start to finish like you do absolutely I think IT like stand by the fact that teaching has only made  like a lot better because I think there are skills you have the navy and you just want to do them but forcing yourself to re explain it to someone else it almost forces you to think about it more concretely and know it know how to talk about it %HESITATION  and like the active explain someone else makes you'll actually internalize it and give what you can reason until like maybe something that was a little bit more soft all like in eight originally %HESITATION  and I think that's the true test  like that's basically what I did to university I would teach like a lot of the university classes I was doing I like twenty eight CI on at university and like teaching university students which is kinda what forced me to be like okay make sure I got I actually know what I'm doing right now him talking about because they're like university results kind of depend on it other any classes that you wish were offered a Google in the growth conformant  yeah I wish that like efficiency like tool efficiency was told a little bit more like I think sketch like that does that cost is not exist I made it for you X. you so wish like that was being told mall I wish that  maybe we had a little a few more excuse not exactly relevant  for  well I just think that Google has so many tools that they built for engineers to like make the engineering process that out and more efficient and the same is not happen for design is so design is a still like spending a lot of time  on things like not  valuable like can give an example and this is  Jerry I mean red lines is like the biggest number one thing all even things like we don't have consistency in how we like build out files each team probably has their own system but like  I'm pretty proud because I think my team actually like outfalls really clean and like they're very well made and it's really easy to like jump in and like they like puzzle pieces because %HESITATION I try to set a very like streaked kind of like not strict that sounds limiting but I'm pretty careful about  making sure we have like downing boxes on things and I'm componentized ing symbols and that there that it's Modula  the way that an engineer would build an apt to be Modula %HESITATION but sometimes they can I sell a lot of time I think that like design is if you don't have that discipline in their team  it means that like maybe it's quicker at the very beginning but you don't get the because you didn't put time at the very beginning to like make things neat  at the end of the day like  it becomes like exponentially harder to read line something that hasn't been organized probably or  %HESITATION  to to duplicate and I create screens that I kind of like off schuessel's like the same screen but the difference in our area it becomes like a lot hotter because it's not neat and it's not like well put together  so I think more  teaching about like process in  optimizing like design being efficient with the tools yeah being a vision with the tools  ask you a few questions just let record up a little bit what are you most excited about going forward  I mean I guess because I'm in design mode so I'm just like thinking about design stuff but I like I said I'm most excited about lake scene where like the tools go and seeing how that like merges informs together %HESITATION  to get more like as I said the unified like the way the engineers think in the way the designers think %HESITATION I'm also really excited about what this is kind of exciting and scary but like  at the same time which is like what is the role of the U. S. as I'm going to be in like five years %HESITATION like ten years because  it's changed it changes so fast and so and and awaits exiting you profession but at the same time like technology moves and changes so fast  that lake who knows if it's still going to be as relevant anymore %HESITATION  but I think like there's always going to be room for like problem solving like problem solving the layer of how humans interact with technology but it might just be different like and use to see how the I. takes off and like how you exes and it like one of the new U. X. paradigms for like such a reality I think well like so very far away from that being like super relevant right now  but that's not to say that  it's not far off though it's not yeah it's like it's not that far off and  there are so many established paradigms for like the screen that it's almost like  it's not easy anymore like it's that's definitely not the right word but it is a lot more  like directed in a way like there's a lot you can kind of pool from and inspired like you can get inspiration from bought  as we shift to this like fiat thing it's going to be completely different like and  home is going to be a land grab like the way that when the iPhone came out it was such an exciting time view exes line because those like a land grab for like designing cool interactions and I remember like even apple would like you there were like the famous cool design like well designed apps and even apple would like take take take the interactions that were coming up and collapse and put into their own like  like operating system like tweet is like swipe down to re fresh like  it's kind of amazing to have like design that pad and seeing that in like so many other places and I think that's gonna happen again for V. R. %HESITATION and not just be a bit like as we move to more like XO screens not just like TV OS's but like touched multiple turn multiple touch screens out like mold like that can be used by most people the same time like that kind of stuff like there's so many interesting ways that as we move into the future and like those screens become a prolific like new patents again for that  thing is the place to live  yeah all right thanks so much for your time thank you  just a final word from a cyclical design did you know you can sign up for Google designs quarterly newsletter covering the latest and greatest design stories from Google and beyond will you have to do is go to design dot Google dot com forward slash Musetta putting your details and receive all this goodness straight into your inbox one of my favorite parts is actually the five things to love right now section this is a curated list of cool things chosen by people like Google and I always learn something new alright that's it from us
