all right I think we are getting  start with  so %HESITATION welcome welcome to our first of fire side live chat to the disease the new format that the we are trying out in collaboration with you weeks light  and the city's form and we want to interview you weeks experts from all over the world and %HESITATION look under the hood off their daily practice and hopefully get some insights how other people from the industry are conducting their business and getting results  so I am Centro I'm from testing time and and I will be your host today  and joining me Lisa  and SO testing time is a Europe wide that test use recruitment service with the pool of over a hundred eighty thousand test users and on our platform testing time dot com you can go online to find your target group and will provide you with the matching study participants within forty eight hours and we are doing this them fireside chat in collaboration with the week's life so use live fees %HESITATION you X. conference series which she's positions are at the intersection off design research and and technology and the next event is actually going to be in two weeks on the October twenty fifth and twenty six in London so if you do not have a ticket that turns you are in London I want to go to London you can go to  you exclude dash life dot C. O. and get one over there and our first speaker in the final set set series Easter Lisa Marie Ortega and she will also be speaking at the U. X. life will take a little bit into that %HESITATION for doing the interview  %HESITATION welcome re do you want to tell our audience today who you are and what your role ace and your backgrounds so that  hi everyone my name's Lisa %HESITATION I'm from Manchester in the U. K. and I run a business call keep usable say where a multi award winning unix agency we help clients to and improve their sales impure conversion %HESITATION to create experiences that are more in line with use need so we do a lot of research and a lot design within that process and one of our specialisms is psychology in behave yet so what I'm speaking about your ex live in a couple of weeks is about psychology and how we can use that to and to make our user experience is more in line with because too many so that we can compare the mines customize and so can be doing a lot of interesting stuff around understanding how people buying why they buying what we can do to combat the means customers  thank you very Nestle  Lisa Marie yeah movies my  all right so you mention actually before were chatting %HESITATION before we came at all to the web in our if you had twenty years of U. X. experience can you tell us a little bit about that  yes there is my twentieth on the first day of being in you axe lead to a about a couple of weeks ago is when I first went to university and %HESITATION so how I got into you acts that might be interesting to people tonight is Sam I originally went to university I studied computing in psychology and as an undergraduate degree on bad back then twenty years ago you couldn't get a job fifteen this two without having a must is so unpleasant I have to go back and do a masters at which ended in human factors in economics and immediately got to jump office not so it really worked and I started my community mobile I'll so I started at Sony Ericsson which counts not fines so you and yet these things that really popular nowadays back then wouldn't they were old business buttons and but that's why south since I started to say you at a usability specialists because you X. didn't exist at the time and I my role is basically as an an internal point of contact for any usability questions point to contact the designers to get some expertise %HESITATION end user license that designs to make them more user centric %HESITATION and %HESITATION I could get to the log research as well so long research because you miss used to follow them down cover does what you how to use mobile fighting looking over the shoulders and because we didn't have things like that so this is a this is a Mister talking and that we use in Europe but while testing so just say that that Mr top it said they didn't exist  and so we have to look at your people stole this and kind of see what they're doing to make notes the same time is really difficult them so you guys nowadays don't know how  you got it which my easy now  and then after this in your ex and %HESITATION a yes at what she had to sign the bill social network and then and when that didn't take how we use and we try to keep it usable and and that was kind of an immediate success in Manchester arms just comes instances junk three the sire and some of the what we've done is being shown at ten Downing Street in London is when the world and being on TV talk about sets that yes we like sites and we look why did you  so you really are a **** also for professional view X. and and use the research  definitely don't see it on TV everyday  really  so you were you were just showing Mr tapi and you were mentioning to me before and that you are sitting in a very special room can you tell us about the room that you're sitting in the S. A. O. and we actually create says hang you at club and so what we want is his day was bring together the benefits of ethnographic research so ethnographic is where you go into researching people's cuttings so you're in that environment it has high research religiosity and because people behave long natural and allow you to tell you what I think can and because they're not constrained by the environment and also you know when you're doing loch research it has benefits in the stake holders watching in the next all so the more engaged in the research they feel like the morning team that the user and demo allow it to take those insights away actually act on them I think anyway and so we wanted to bring those to solve  violence to get that we thought might was the best way to do that that's to create a homely environment that gives you the so the maker of the lab environment but with the clue fits in relaxation of the hind sight you and when we create sell out we also went away from the window coach so a lot doesn't have a long way nana and so I'll just show you it quickly so that you can understand what it's like  you can see we've got so homely wallpaper we've got an a front door as well safe I just a you can as quickly  you'll stay out too it's like infant does well and on the outside we will pay post it looks like a house when you coming into it and then we got comfy Chas and fluffy carpet so I just think in the text as well on that one I'm sorry I'm such a desk and  I see one of our users created this lovely book for us as well with paper folding cited bring us presents occasionally and I can  so the idea is the am people coming comments sorry let me just get this set up again and so people come in and it just beats all expectations because they come in expecting an office environment quite a full movie full setup and straight away it just relaxes them you know they got a they often clinic %HESITATION while was expecting this is the crazy and homely and and then straight way they can relax as well they do have to worry about the cameras as well so we use little cameras and light you can sing with Mr topic here  it's quite a small town and said just got point  down over the side they just to get back to it strikes me and so we really put a lot of thought into the environment it's not just about how you conduct research it's about means on when you come to in as well so I could be the best research in Wellesley from putting someone in environment when you don't feel comfortable enough to come right up to me and tell me that on these thoughts and opinions and that's really what one Steve because conducting research is all about psychology in understanding you know what's really going on in the thought process and understanding the concerns and fears at what the anxious about getting them to tell us about those things which is quite difficult if someone doesn't feel comfortable  can you very interesting can you tell us a bit more in detail about how does it look like when a participant comes into the office what do you do how do you make them feel comfortable do you offer them something to drink what how how does it look like and next to the  actually we need in the lab is next to our front door so we didn't want them we didn't want to will consider an office because straight to where you know they see people saw that asks it will start to intimidate them they'll start to think about the people that work at the company so we try to get them into the research room as quickly as possible and so they don't have the interaction they don't believe in St cold is  I yeah I offer them a drink make sure they don't fully on yeah equipment and the give me a few snacks to eat as well depending on the time of day and sometimes do evening research  it's in the evening will get them there I will give them pieces three since I'm just make sure that that comfortable well looked after and sometimes we put a bit of background music on as well just to get away from that deadly silence that you can sometimes got  and so you know we just think of things to do really to make them feel at home in the week even out that these candles that we house the senses as well see walking to the ring you get someone I stands as well you just little touches lie about communing make a difference to people  and it's also about the experience off the test user right and so thinking about the experience also test user during the whole %HESITATION user test and have you seen the differences in results %HESITATION since you opened the homeland well the reason I built it originally was because I had some bad experiences with women a lapse so you %HESITATION  you know sometimes you get passes pent Hey you well I mean one person we had and we literally have to stop the session early because she she heard people several through the one way mirror on the light came on accidentally at one point so you could actually see the people in the other very  oh god it was awful so we we we left it yeah we stop the session early in and sent her time and she was petrified you know I really didn't matter what I do doesn't mean that she's trying to lock that she just come by that point and so yeah I mean the other thing about when when there is is that you've got to think of the observation experiences while so nice I five spoken about the the participants experience but also you know you want stakeholders to have a  the great day out to the office you want let's go white with ideas and damned if you put people in a DA creating that they're gonna fall asleep you know doing this nice warm without reading and they're not going to talk to each other you that because what you find is because they can see the person really clearly on this if you're the site America they tend to list them all and if you get away from nine you have a sound to shrink this is this is how  and they can not to just talk with each other and it almost becomes a workshop day our what a convenient stick the user interface designs on the green and when they listen to the user feedback I can and scrolling joy of ideas and they can talk they can allow fino fuses the something funny productive worry about not left and %HESITATION and then you have natural daylight in the being as well so we now observation natural daylight sorrow at which I get away from putting people in the top three means that we even have created lighting in that as well so you cannot see it just the main just having so you get out of it and a red line each if you want people to a device that fits your bronze or you want people to feel more passionate than though I don't agree I did better and we can stick with glee that's nice calming color any six top bands but yeah which will any you can see twenty observational how does that set up look like so you you records the screen and the face and then %HESITATION half that on a separate screen in a provisional that yeah exactly so we were streaming through your live video feeds a note here saying what's going on here and say thanks to all sorry to keep stay close concentration of what people are doing sire  and with a local youth with a woman a level you'll find is that the the tension is directed to the mirror on what's going on each huge you know people want to watch the user and the research on the of the site and then your user interface and interaction say for example with mobile oil is on the small screen in the corner of the ring and so people looking through the the Mira and they should actually be looking at the U. R. I. E. I'm sorry %HESITATION the the positive at this is that we we concentrate people's attention on the user interface because that's what we also ahead for you know it's about user experience and their interaction with digital platforms side because the trade the state calls attention on not and what people are saying and then they can see them as well but that secondary you know we've got it set at that's the second G. tensions is drawn said actual persons  yeah we we thought about all the little details insult yes I can see that  I am so when we tracked back a little bit so when you are and you know you you  the discipline has sat down and %HESITATION is ready for the test and can you tell us a little bit about sort of how you start an interview or user tests and also maybe some about as some ideas and tips about into new techniques that you use  I carries sorrow  I always think you know if you think from a person's perspective they call men's they may have never done research before they don't know what to expect and then a little bit with the fact that so it's nice just to to some general chit chat you know about the weather  and about what they've done in the weekend just to just to relax them and you know just spent five minutes on the  and then start with an office that you do have some things you need to do you like confidentiality phones non disclosure forms and consent forms and so just make sure you got out of the way as well and and the if they've got any questions you found those as well on then I tend to start with just some general questions around the scene with the research so stop quite wrote and then narrowed down into smaller areas Iran and then move on to the digital and farm so I'll stop quite often now on digital just as a one to one chat with them and then we'll we'll drilling deeper and then in my kitchen tasks to do and I might get into right those tasks  and always keep questions are you as well so you never want to be asking closed questions when you do research you was once be keeping keeping I questions and also follow up with your questions a lot as well so I I I see a lot of research is I'll ask a question the participant will answer and then they'll move on to the next question was actually they could have tied to the ends of a bit more just to get to the deeper levels of understanding you can really get behind the psychology as well and so sometimes people will tell you announce that and I see that the real on set is under the why away from that so you just need to ask in the why on top of it and you get to the true answer and so he's got to straighten if you if you watch someone do an interview and they don't asking why questions or how questions  I didn't say a surface yeah yeah questions that allow you to just dig a little deeper behind the surface on so they give you to the true reasons is fine now reading Chastain  interesting so how do you I mean you do you done probably hundreds of abuse the tests %HESITATION during the past  how do you sort of Ellen  larger research project we sort of more off the lien iterative user testing approach especially if you are embedded in a %HESITATION product team and you you are sort of rolling with the spring how do you how do you sort of balance those two  well I guess is a research and you always have to decide what the best method is so you would and you get that was as an agency for instance so will come to us and we have to ascertain if they tell me says before if %HESITATION if this is the first time house enough that comes with the with the mailbox is this the first time they've done any research on that  in which case we need to look at a bigger piece with more uses %HESITATION couple you know one hour sessions where you can get deeper into it getting coffee most tasks have more conversation with them or is it a test in the past and it's just %HESITATION maybe is part of the design process where they just want some quick intuitive testing to feeding three in which case for conceptual to sessions with up to go his date it could be more feasible see past  and it could be where we just feed back there believe out the marketing report so that you can get really quick findings back to the design team  the trees you know on the same day even  so I guess yeah the method that you choose is very dependent on on the problem that you're trying to sell and you know what your hypotheses office solving that problem and so yeah it's never as a one size fits all which is why research is quite interesting you know the approach you take you know you might want to do some eye tracking on something for instance if you want to create a face so you Kamal boxes or the hassle of user testing  %HESITATION you've got a website where you're looking at fine tuning the conversions fine tuning the design conversion and get more people to buy then you might want to do so my truck in just to see what's come ten people using what I not use an iron which text today reading this is which text of the note read in and what date indecisive about know whether the eyes flicking between two things you can see it as a problem that they why they being indecisive what is it that you could do to improve don make that decision easier for them and so yeah this then as a lot of different things out that and yeah it's good to to the things will involve different methods and techniques and then you pick and choose and from your tool kit what's best to approach that problem that you're you're being asked to solve  and hot what how do you sink on that user research sort of evolved over the past years and what do you think will sort of seem more or less %HESITATION %HESITATION in the in the future  how's it really over over the years I mean I I  in an eight twenty is %HESITATION and the basics of the same really nice psychology was still other thing will have to really understand how people thank you note I'm because without save time as well I've seen people's interaction change they what type of the is and in a row at one point he was laying themselves as well when I tried to do use the task people just playing themselves if they did something wrong that is definitely turns now people will blame the software blame the company you know if I cannot use the group's website I'll bling boot was before with the playing myself does definitely changed massively and people more weather usability Morrow is a term as well ease of use them all wet of things needing to be easy arms that that comes up a lot more and technology we've go a bit better with so you know the I. truck is now we can really nice glasses that have really things writings quite nicely people's last so they're not as conscious about wearing them you know they can forget about them at that mall and I think someone if if there any sort of develop is watching this I think we could do you mean them some software that would be great Qasem  I mean I've used everything everything T. records usability tests and then  you know I still end up going back to Maggie and I eat so clunky an old now and %HESITATION  but it is reliable it never let me down where is all the software has let me down and said yeah I'd be great if someone could set design a something funky cool a month in that region that we can use to test with  and I did I was on  question isn't  well there are few questions already from the audience as well Ekaterina asks what sort of equipment do you use them in general %HESITATION in addition to Mister Tapp be software and hardware to you have some %HESITATION I mean you just mentioned one software do you do you sort of always trying new things or do you sort of keep two year olds to stick I'm I probably used to try more things  for now though I tend to stick with Mariah bit more now and what we use things like quick telling and still look back we used to use until it stops supporting and if they stop developing it and  okay with other things as well and contagious for instance %HESITATION you can do and Google hang outs you could too and me moments software like go to meeting and you come across from Knox as well and zooms quite good so she wants to do and mobile testing well you're not too bothered about closing the sink amazement and it seems quite good from remote motivated research  I mean  hardware wineries an we use macs or we use windows computers you can use whatever mobile also watching what I quite like to do is get people to determine that I'm device with them so we'll get in spring that I'm %HESITATION bile and Styx Mr talking I've read on that and you get a finger movements as well as what's on the  screen and so that's quite important as well as just seeing where people will going to fast and they didn't quite fast so you know if something didn't work on the screen and they they get past that you can see the frustration whether doing this and they get more noise in that size and so %HESITATION that's really interesting to say as well %HESITATION but yeah we don't have fun bickering cameras so you might expect with is having a lot that we would have you know the big clunky cameras on the ceiling now my experience with those is that you get the tops of people's heads so what we did was we carry with the small account sure yet because the I'm using at the moment so because myself but said I'm you know just small  small %HESITATION what comes a high definition of the hasty cameras they have drooling over here on them as well that's all you need I'm in if you're just starting out just invest in these a Logitech HD cameras and another early and you know you got really good  you know these women really well get really high quality definition and so yeah you don't always have to spend a lot on these big cameras on the wall where you get the tops of people's heads you can get the monthly and just sat on the desk pointed nope you can get really good close ups of people spice that way as well  well thanks for that tool roundup let's I think very interesting always for people to see motivated document views as well so we've got to and you've got a document viewable I find the quality and not know as good as this so I tend to get back to this column  thank you  well almost at the end of  the well financed  let's cover  so maybe one thing and you will have and talk at you weeks life and in a couple weeks I  so can you tell us a bit more about what you'll be covering there and why you sort of chose the topic why it's a current topic but you  so I'm speaking about you X. psychology and the reason is that psychology is fundamental to user experience and I think it's got a little bit overlooked and look first to the styling to these days you know people are coming into the U. X. may be into U. X. design and that then maybe just changing from a different role they've not necessarily being Jean vesti instead of competing psychology like I did so and it's something that is really  %HESITATION Soltis experience no it user experience has the has uses in the titles I mean you know it's all about understanding uses its understanding people and how they think and how they behave so is really crucial to learn about it really helps you to design things that are going to resonate with people engage with them and and be more effective so my took up there quite a few things in my talk so I'm just gonna refers to the bullet points that I put down but basically we're going to try and  I can understand why people buy and we're gonna understand how the body I'm gonna go through some of the famous principles out that this way you shin and how we can use persuasion principles in design to come that people in check  Hey you get back to it and we're going to look at the value of psychology in you axe and yet savings that you can apply to your work so you can be able to go away from my session with things today and %HESITATION just a little tip for anyone out there going to exercise my session I actually did this last year as well so they invited me back to doing the workshop this year and but last year it sold  the ticket that the spaces on my workshop when immediately within about ten minutes so if you want to go to my work shop just make sure you get in that quick that's my biggest emendation and will also can look at how you call that user insights and use those transform your designs and yeah and how do you persuade and influence people through designs that would bring in the psychology into the design site I'm looking at how we can make people do what we want them today  in a nice way  S.  so everyone who is at U. X. live should definitely check out Lisa's session and presentation and workshop  and so to sort of finish things off before the queue in a final question do you have some favorite books or online resources tools you already mentioned %HESITATION that sort of  appeal to your knowledge over time and that %HESITATION you you use in a record on a regular basis maybe and as a reference material actually there is one I forgotten to bring in and my favorite book is gross psychology so called psychology is by a guy  his first name's Richard price and but that took me all the way through university and I've still got my copy now in its got coffee stains on it it's got your dump stains on from where I put it on the window sill universe today  it's really well used I love it and I'm not just near my in depth psychology book and bull if you don't want to go read of massive book like this take %HESITATION idle symbols are digestible books for you and say view sixteen in the wall is really good as a starting point for people and he wants games you axe and H. is really nicely written this loss of visuals in as well photographs and things it'll tell you how to do research to give you some tips for design as well and is really good if you if you don't really have anyone else in your company that does you axe this will be your best friend basically I'm and then I've got a couple from season one shank cues inspired me really and to focus on psychology within you acts I find psychology fascinating and Susan's books again you can see that quite then so the quite nice to read our site this one is called near what design  I need to say is just lo serve  well lots of highlights as well for me as I've been to rest and  but she again everything is just really digestible and this one hundred things list you know you can just pick a %HESITATION  one of the things is really is really not just independent ourselves just to refresh yourself so you tell all about psychology and are you apply psychology to you X.  and yeah I think that my favorite ones Susan's definitely worth following had locus well she sheds a law of academic and findings as well so the latest academic research that you can apply to U. acts just keep keep with that with what's going on  all right thank you very much you welcome them so %HESITATION let's  jump into the queue in a two three questions %HESITATION I think we have time for that so Catharina asks if a company just starts doing user research and there's only one person responsible for user research what would you recommend to do mobile  remote the already holding off the book read book  that's what you what was the book called again and the user experience team of one okay good doesn't hold  Dan Michael as once you have your research how do you package your findings to make it easier to hand off to designers or do you make design changes yourself  so it depends I rent some projects we do design changes which is a pretty easy %HESITATION so that means that means the researcher can sit together with the designer and constantly gives my in Paul and the sister designs as well and also apply that level of psychology to the designs as well so the designs that we produce on just you X. designs that goal that level of persuasion in them as well we're always thinking about you know even just the words you use you know how to even had a few exciting and it's called  rising apply to you at some way you can actually and reflects the way that people say things and describe things back into the copy of your website and that will really resonate with people engage with them so just doing little things like that can make a big difference and if we're doing the research and hunting able to design team and we will create a report the findings not the stuff that you do you nasty Sir we don't we don't write long text reports that no one reads Christmas I bought in and we do things are visual so taking screen shots and annotating those who is really easy for design it's a got to look at a page and go buy these with the findings this is what I need today  and I and also creating a highlight video works really well as well say just as a as a reminder for anyone he went to the research and they just want a quick ten minute reminder of what the main findings were and and also the stake holders that couldn't attend the research it's a nice way just to understand what went on during the day and will use the side without having to watch eight hours of video  and say yeah I think sending things really visually helps especially designed this because that they tend to be visual people are but it's all about you know communicates in in a way that he call and we'll be able to get from not what they need is on that side %HESITATION and yeah if it's designed as he could visual screen shots not lots a tax to be succinct evidence and I was wells %HESITATION and you know  are the user quite  in that the backup your recommendation as well cook the fines in  zero always evidencing with that with the research  all right last question from Lina  who do use the chance to be part of usability testing and %HESITATION that's why %HESITATION at  question on top and how do you eat as sort of in most and product management developers etcetera  and  I always think the more people involved the better ands and actually what I love today is because it can be difficult to get everyone out of the office and into the research lab for the day we actually rely to stream it back to the office and so what we encourage people still respect meeting ring back at the office and the string the research and not being and it can be like a shopping day for people and you find that more people will attend it that way so you will get the cost of money just popping in and even CEOs we'd have popping in just to see what's happening because they're always interested to hear what customers say about that other  and so I find that works well with hearts and people dialing in as well so  as well as streaming into meeting back in the office you can also send out dialing link and then people can be working from home and dialing and they can be doing the work at the same time site that way that not feeling that feeling guilty for taking time away from work and although it's nice if they can do that if they can just take it day out to to engage with the user research you know sometimes they just calm  they can decide the desktop that has tons in like this and they can be listening to the research as they're doing the work at least is going in some things going into that had and you know that that that in spirit study room  so yeah I would think the more people you can get what she says asset because it just it affects the whole company effects the whole business you know we haven't seen your who's making that major business decisions based on the results of our research that we do is not just about the time team it is much wider than not you know the more that you can learn about your customers just the whole back to your business will be in the most successful you'll be at the end of the day  so M. apart from making making it easily accessible during live sessions or OR live streams and so forth how how do you approach alter departments and and sort of make it  and how do you  sort of convinced them to to to take part what are sort of goods arguments because I think a lot of people are struggling with that  well I when I you I tell you when I worked as an Ericsson why did was that I I befriended people so you know just going to speak to people and maybe doing some presentations internally to different teams and if you can talk in that language as well don't talk in the language if user experience and and things that they're not gonna understands chines speaking in terms that they will understand and you know that will make them see the benefits according to  what are you doing that job so how will this research help you and your team to be active in the most successful so talk on that level with them and if it's developers in pieces always works you know if you if you say no you want to get developers to coming up if you reset say that we're gonna have some pieces we can make into a bit of a phone session and I did a beatnik creative in that area don't be too formal and don't be too pushy you know people will rebel against that if you're too pushy with them and always trying to be helpful and %HESITATION  yeah make it say the eight benefits them to contact you and to get your expertise and advice and make yourself approachable and then  yeah I mean sometimes you see people in that they are quite full sites in their views and %HESITATION China imposed on the company because they feel really strongly about you acts and I get the I. you in our police to be that person that room for you but then you realize that the way to persuade and influence people is to speak on the level that will and engage more with them so to speak that language and some of the things that we doing in user experience now speaking the uses language speakers stake holders on Christian  pull together is a great getting the money all signed and maybe doing some exercises to  and highlight the benefits of using research and listening to the customer in Boston the benefit since transferring those insights into the design and what the end that will be in the best business decisions that they'll be able to mate Kansas  and yet that will end up with them and get in that promotion because that would be most successful you know effectively how you're helping them is and then some of these people in town right  and the beating about the embassy you have towards your co workers rights and and sort of how you can help them yeah yeah don't go in there you know all guns blazing unit you must listen to the customize the right thing to do is you may not make friends that way even though it is the right thing to do a real nice and so be it talks will be this way he said it may be helpful %HESITATION shadow things as well as you know the more that you can share with others and you have the marketing team I got so we found these insights that you might find useful in your project might help you if you want discuss them let's arrange a meeting with you %HESITATION fit together and so being helpful rather than too pushy with people can also help  get people on your sites as well because the the more people you get on your site and that will and you know they become your ambassadors also they'll tell the people in my teens so if you can just make some good friends  some can come toxin and not spread the words as well  right thanks a lot for your all your insights  and I'm sure our audience learned a lot from your wise words and from all of your experience that you have in the field of you ex so where can people connect with you %HESITATION last winter or  yeah I have everything inside  a if you search for Lisa maybe I'll tell you that %HESITATION I'm on Instagram Twitter and we have our blog keep usable as well and so you
