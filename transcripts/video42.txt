sort of say %HESITATION I'm succeeding %HESITATION these people just be our own if I remember very distinctly  even during the interview process %HESITATION this is true for the but %HESITATION the Billboard was conducting that's making you want to be the CEO %HESITATION and I said only if you want me to be the CEO and %HESITATION the feedback I got was what but people who want to be CEOs are like I want to be see I said look that's not me and I remember when %HESITATION I'm going in talking to Stephen he says yeah it just be yourself it's too late to change sentry been the CO three and a half years %HESITATION the stock is up about the I guess it's about a hundred twenty percent when you go to the your annual shareholder meeting so you get a standing ovation for what you've done or the no I get a lot of people's asking me Hey look go come home and fix my computer okay  you are a native of India what part of India %HESITATION I was born in Hyderabad %HESITATION which is in the central part of India  so growing up your parents %HESITATION doted on you I assume  yeah they did and they told you you were going to be prime minister or something important in the country what they want you to be they just want me to stop playing cricket and take my studies a little more seriously now you were an avid cricket player  yes that is great I was in love with it and when did you realize you were going to be a professional cricket hot if pretty soon  quickly I realized that at best %HESITATION I would pay %HESITATION beat overhead a what is considered perhaps first class

extent of my ambition he looks at me and says what are you doing you got to get out of this place it's a he pushed me out %HESITATION to get to an engineering school %HESITATION and that pretty much of course heater defined the trajectory after his father was a member of the of the senior civil service which is important %HESITATION position I guess in India is that right yeah my dad was a very different guy than me in terms of %HESITATION let me say his academic all provinces out so it is always humorous which you do look at my report cards and this is all I couldn't I don't understand how anybody can have these kind of marks and up but the nice thing about it was he would say it in such endearing ways that it never made me feel bad I mean the parts weren't high enough for weren't are not high enough they were high enough as yet he the guy had never met an exam he didn't ace as he would say okay %HESITATION and so he was a he thought it was astounding to me that he would have a son

Milwaukee %HESITATION and did you have a winter coat or  that was my first very valued possession in life %HESITATION into court which is very important %HESITATION unfortunately I picked up this bad habit of smoking in India in college %HESITATION and the one nice thing about going to school in Milwaukee is the %HESITATION you if you're a smoker you have to go out in the winter and smoke %HESITATION and not one winter in Milwaukee cured me of my smoking out  so you got a job after you graduated at Sun Microsystems and what was your job there %HESITATION I was offered of offer  and
